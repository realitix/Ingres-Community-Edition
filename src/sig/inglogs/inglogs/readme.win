inglogs.bat - A Windows script to collect some Ingres and OS information
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary:
--------
Latest version: 1.04
Last Updated: 20-Jun-2011

From time to time this script may be updated so check the version you have
is the latest.
 
Problem:
--------

inglogs.bat is a Windows batch script that can be used to get a snapshot of the
state of an Ingres installation. 

It was originally called "mut.bat" because it was designed to diagnose mutex 
hangs, however it's also a good script to run to gather all the useful logs and 
status information.

It's similar to the inglogs script (see KB doc 415682) but is for Windows rather
than unix
 
Resolution:
-----------

Usage:

open an Ingres command prompt 

Change to a directory where you wish to create the output files e.g.

   cd C:\temp
   
Note that the output files can be quite large (especially if you use the
-logdump option) so make sure you are on a drive with plenty of space

Then run the inglogs.bat file

   %II_SYSTEM%\ingres\sig\inglogs\inglogs.bat

at the prompt. It will create a sub-directory in the current directory which 
includes the current date and time e.g. "INGLOGS_20091008_101649" 
After it runs this directory contains all the files it has created. 
If sending this to Support then it's a good idea to zip it up into a single 
file.

If you're using inglogs.bat to diagnose a situation where there is a hang then
it's possible that it may not complete running. In which case after a few 
minutes use ctrl-c to quit.

Example output:

     if the script does not respond for a long time then
     it's possible that it has hung - in which case

Output from inglogs --help:
---------------------------

INGLOGS version 1.02_WIN
 
Usage: inglogs [-nosystemconfig] [-nosystemstate] [-nologfiles] 
               [-noingresconfig] [-noingresstate] [-logdump]
       inglogs [-h|-help]
       inglogs [--help]
       inglogs [-v|-version|--version]
 
The inglogs script collects some information from your system which 
might be helpful for analysis. By default it collects as much information 
as possible, but you can switch off some "modules" if wanted. 
 
The script connects to all DBMS via iimonitor, which may not  
respond if there is a problem.In this case use C to interrupt. 
 
To report on the state of custom DBMS server classes edit inglogs.bat 
and look for the line with CUSTOM. Replace CUSTOM with your server 
class name 
 
The following information is collected: 
 
module systemconfig: 
  set 
  ver 
  systeminfo  
module systemstate: 
  tasklist /v  
  tasklist /svc  
  net start  
  netstat -a 
module ingconfig: 
  config.dat, config.log, protect.dat,symbol.tbl, symbol.log 
  ingprenv 
  version.rel, version.dat 
  syscheck -v 
module inglogfiles: 
  errlog.log, iircp.log, iiacp.log 
  dbms logs 
module ingstate: 
  logstat, logstat -verbose 
  lockstat, lockstat -dirty 
  iimonitor: show all sessions, show all sessions formatted 
  iimonitor: show mutex x 
  iinamu 
 
Flags: 
-no<modulename> 
  (-nosystemconfig -nosystemstate -nologfiles -noingresconfig -noingresstate) 
  By default all the above modules are executed, you can switch off 
  one or multiple modules by using -no<modulename> ...  
 
-logdump 
  By default inglogs does not perform a logdump as the output can be very 
  large. You can tell it to do a logdump with -logdump 
 
-help (-h) 
  Prints out a short usage message and exits 
 
--help 
  Prints out this message and exits 
 
--version (-v, -version) 
  Prints out the version of inglogs and exits
