The program in this directory serves as an example of using Ingres and 
the Ingres Management Architecture (IMA) to provide an ima equivalent
of the ipm utility.

This code is provided as an example only. It is an unsupported example

facilities in Ingres. The code in this directory is Copyright (c)

For a discussion of IMA - see the Ingres System Reference Manual and 
Advisor doc US-126867

The program is written in embedded SQL with FRS calls. 

Files in this directory:

Makefile		Makefile for the utility - this file will need to 
			be edited to add the relevant libraries for each 
			platform. Change the LIBS line to contain the library 
			list specified in the LDLIBMACH variable in the file:

				$II_SYSTEM/ingres/utility/iisysdep 

imp.forms		Copyform output of the forms used in the application

impstatic.sc 		The source code files for the utility

imp.sql 		SQL script to register the required tables

To run all of the setup steps:

% make all

To run the setup steps individually:
1. To setup the utility, as privileged INGRES user, register the 
   imp IMA tables and procedures.

% make register

2. Copy the form in, then get a compiled version:

% make copyform
% make compform

3. Build the application:

% make imp



To run the application, use

% imp [database] [-rTIMEOUT_SECONDS]

Where:

database		is the name of the database containing the IMA tables.
TIMEOUT_SECONDS		is the number of seconds for the refresh interval.

The screen output is similar to ipm.
