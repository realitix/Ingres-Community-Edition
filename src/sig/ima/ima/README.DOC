The program in this directory serves as an example of using Ingres and 
the Ingres Management Architecture (IMA) to provide a monitoring utility for
threads in each of the servers in the installation.

This code is provided as an example only. It is an unsupported example 
provided by Actian Corporation to help customers who wish to use the IMA 
facilities in Ingres. The code in this directory is Copyright (c) 1995 
Actian Corporation. 

Actian Corporation accepts no responsibility for any damage or action 
arising from the use of this code.

For a discussion of IMA - see the Ingres System Reference Manual and 
Advisor doc US-126867

The program is written in embedded SQL with FRS calls. It makes use of 
two IMA registered tables 'ima_server_sessions' and 'ima_unix_sessions' to
get information about the relative I/O rates of sessions within the INGRES
server processes. In addition - it makes use of an Ingres 'DBMS global 
temporary' table.

Files in this directory:

Makefile		Makefile for the utility - this file will need to 
			be edited to add the relevant libraries for each 
			platform. Change the LIBS line to contain the library 
			list specified in the LDLIBMACH variable in the file:

				$II_SYSTEM/ingres/utility/iisysdep 

iomon.form		Copyform output of the form used in the application

iomon.sc		The source code for the utility

iomon.sql		SQL script to register the required tables

To setup the utility, as privileged INGRES user, create a database as the 
'$ingres' user, then register the IMA tables and procedures.

% createdb -u\$ingres imadb
% make register

Copy the form in, then get a compiled version:

% make copyform
% make compform

Build the application:

% make

To run the application, use

% iomon [database] [-rTIMEOUT_SECONDS]

Where:

database		is the name of the database containing the IMA tables.
TIMEOUT_SECONDS		is the number of seconds for the refresh interval.

The screen output is as follows:

Where:

Server		is the server process containing the session performing I/O
Session		is the decimal representation of the session ID
Terminal 	is the local terminal identifier
User		is the username of the owner of the session
I/O		is the number of disk I/O operations in this refresh cycle

The barchart represents relative I/O rates. The most resource intensive session
completely fills the available space, all other sessions being shown relative
to this one.
