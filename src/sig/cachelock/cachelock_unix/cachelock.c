**
**  Name: CACHELOCK - UNIX Utility Program to lock the shared DMF cache 
**
**  Description:
**
**    This program locks the entire shared DMF cache in processor memory.  
**    The program cannot be used to lock non-shared caches, nor 
**    to lock part of the cache.  It is not usable on all
**    UNIX platforms.  
**
**    Read the "read.me" file before running this program. 
**
**    CACHELOCK is designed for use in systems where it is either
**    undesirable or impossible to lock the cache via the preferred
**    "dmf.lock_cache" server startup parameter.  The program
**    must be run setuid root, and to be effective must remain alive 
**    while the system is up.  
**
**    "mmap_exists" and "no_mmap" ifdefs select code appropriate to
**    either mmap/mlock or older SYS V shmat/shmctl usage. The 
**    "cachelock.h" header file must contain the appropriate #define.
**
**    The server must be running prior to starting this program
**    and must employ the same memory management facility
**    (mmap() or shmctl()) used by this program.  Furthermore, the 
**    server must be configured to run with "shared_cache".
**
**    The only program argument is the name of the shared DMF cache,
**    as follows:
**
**           cachelock <shared_cache_file_name>
**
**    The program runs until stopped by a kill command, or if run
**    interactively, by Control-C.  It will be paged out after it locks 
**    the memory, so imposes little system overhead.
**
**    The program may need to be modified to work properly on
**    some UNIX platforms.
**
**    NOTE:  Locking memory is potentially VERY disruptive to system 
**    performance, so this program should be used with UTMOST CAUTION!!!  
**    Closely monitor system performance after starting the program.
**	  	
**    Inputs (argv):
**        cache_name                      Full pathname of the cache to lock
**                           (typically $II_SYSTEM/ingres/files/cach_def.dat)
**
**    Outputs (exit status):
**         0                              Normal exit
**         Nonzero    			  Error exit code
**
**    Exceptions:
**	   None.
**
**    Side Effects:
**         None. 
**
** History:
**
**      20-mar-1992 (jnash)
**          Created.
**	16-may-1995 (morayf)
**	    Changed shmat return value check from long to (char *) as
**	    this is how it is declared in <sys/shmat.h>.
**	10-may-1999 (walro03)
**	    Remove obsolete version string odt_us5.
