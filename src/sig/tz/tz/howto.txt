Abstract:
Worked example of how to change timezone rules, using example
based on Autralian timezones. Should only be attempted if
rules have changed from those supplied with product.

Ingres now supplies iiworld.tz which contains all support
time zones. For more up to date instructions please refer to 
the readme.html found in this directory.

Expert Note:
Instructions on changing the timezone rule files.

1.	Timezone support in Ingres
	------------------------------

	This is an aspect of our SQL2 support. In order to achieve this,
	dates and adjusted if displayed in another timezone to that which 
	they are stored in.
	
	Timezone data is loaded from a binary file on disk into
	static tables in server memory with rules for determining the time 
	adjustments according to local DST etc.

	The timezone files are generated using a utility 'iizic', which is
	based on a UNIX public domain utility 'zic'. The utility accepts a 
	text file of rules and identifying information for a given timezone, 
	which are then compiled into a binary file and stored on disk. 
	Rule file format is also public domain POSIX/TZ format, and is 
	decribed in more detail below. A corresponding INGRES utility
	'iizck' is also supplied to read back the contents of a binary file.

	Ingres uses the Ingres symbol II_TIMEZONE_NAME to identify
	the TZ of an installation. This will use, by default, the binary
	file at $II_SYSTEM/ingres/files/zoneinfo/<timezone-group>/<timezone-name>,
	but this can be overridden (for local user or installation as a whole)
	by variable II_TIMEZONE_FILE.  II_TIMEZONE_NAME may also be overriden
	by a local user.



2.	Changing rules for existing timezone
	------------------------------------

1)  Save ALL timzeone files which you wish to change.

	Thse will be found at $II_SYSTEM/ingres/files/zoneinfo/*/*
	
2) Generate the new timezone rule files using the file below:

	iizic -d /some/directory australasia.tz

   Two directories, "astrl" and "sp" should be created. 

3) If you want you can check the new files by using iizck, 
   for example:

	iizck -f /some/directory/astrl/qnslnd

4) Bring Ingres down using ingstop.

5) Substitute the new files into the zoneinfo directory, 
   for example:

	cd $II_SYSTEM/ingres/files/zoneinfo/astrl
	mv qnslnd qnslnd.save
	cp /some/directory/astrl/qnslnd .

6) Restart Ingres using ingstart.


3.	Adding new timezone
	-------------------

	This requires changes to:

	$II_SYSTEM/ingres/files/tz.crs
	$II_SYSTEM/ingres/files/config.dat

	and should not be attempted without consulting Ingres support.

	If you change the timezone name, you will need to
	change II_TIMEZONE_NAME in the symbol table while Ingres is down.

4.2	Composition of lines
	--------------------

	 Input lines are made up of  fields.   Fields  are  separated
     by white space characters.  Leading/ trailing white space 
	 is  ignored.  White space characters and sharp characters
     may be enclosed in ` "' (double quotes) if  they're  to
     be  used  as part of a field.

     An  `#' (unquoted sharp character) in the input introduces a
     comment which extends to the end of the line the sharp 
	 character appears on.  
	 
	 Any line that is blank (after comment stripping) is ignored.  
	 Non-blank lines are expected to be either rule lines or zone lines

4.3	Rule lines
	----------

    A rule line has the form

          Rule  NAME  FROM  TO    TYPE  IN   ON       AT    SAVE  LETTER/S

    For example:

          Rule  USA   1969  1973  -     Apr  lastSun  2:00  1:00  D

    The fields that make up a rule line are:

     NAME    User-defined name of the set of rules  this
             rule is part of.

     FROM    First year in which the rule applies. Valid values:
			 valid year
			 
			 minimum (or an abbreviation)    - the minimum
             year with a representable time value.  
			
			maximum  (or  an  abbreviation)  - the maximum year
             with a representable time value.

     TO      Final year in which the rule applies. Valid values as FROM.

     TYPE    Gives the type of year in which  the  rule  applies.

			 '-' 		all years between FROM and TO
			 'uspres'	U.S presidential election years
			 'nonpres'	years other than U.S presidential years
			 other		valid type for system call 'yearistype()'

     IN      Full name of the month in which the rule takes effect. 

     ON      Gives the  day  on  which the rule takes effect.
             Recognized forms include:

             5         the fifth of the month

             lastSun
                       the last Sunday in the month

             lastMon
                       the last Monday in the month

             Sun>=8
                       first Sunday on or after the eighth

             Sun<=25
                       last Sunday on or before the 25th

             Names of days of the  week  may  be  abbreviated  or
             spelled  out in full.  Note: there must be no spaces
             within the ON field.

     AT      Gives the time  of  day  at  which  the  rule  takes
             effect.  Recognized forms include:

             2              time in hours

             2:00           time in hours and minutes

             15:00          24-hour format time (for times  after
                            noon)

             1:28:14        time in hours, minutes, and seconds


     Any of these forms may be followed by the letter  w  if  the
     given  time  is  local ``wall clock'' time or s if the given
     time is local ``standard'' time; in the absence of w  or  s,
     wall clock time is assumed.

     SAVE Gives the amount of time to be added to local  standard
          time  when  the  rule is in effect.  This field has the
          same format as the AT field (although, of course, the w
          and s suffixes are not used).

     LETTER/S
          Gives the ``variable part'' (for example, the ``S''  or
          ``D'' in ``EST'' or ``EDT'') of time zone abbreviations
          to be used when this rule is in effect.  If this  field
          is `-', the variable part is null.


4.4	Format of zone line
	-------------------
	
	A zone line has the form

          Zone  NAME                  GMTOFF  RULES/SAVE  FORMAT  [UNTIL]

     For example:

Zone  Australia/South-west  9:30    Aus         CST     1987 Mar 15 2:00

     The fields that make up a zone line are:

     NAME  The name of the time zone.  This is the name  used  in
           creating  the time conversion information file for the
           zone.

     GMTOFF
           The amount of time to add to GMT to get standard  time
           in  this  zone.  This field has the same format as the
           AT and SAVE fields of rule lines; begin the field with
           a minus sign if time must be subtracted from GMT.

     RULES/SAVE
           The name of the rule(s) that apply in  the  time  zone
           or,  alternately,  an  amount  of time to add to local
           standard time.  If this field  is  `-'  then  standard
           time always applies in the time zone.

     FORMAT
           The format for time zone abbreviations  in  this  time
           zone.  The pair of characters %s is used to show where
           the ``variable part'' of the  time  zone  abbreviation
           goes.   UNTIL  The time at which the GMT offset or the
           rule(s) change for a location.  It is specified  as  a
           year,  a  month, a day, and a time of day.  If this is
           specified, the time zone information is generated from
           the  given  GMT  offset and rule change until the time
           specified.

           The next line must be a  ``continuation''  line;  this
           has  the  same  form  as  a  zone line except that the
           string ``Zone'' and the name are omitted, as the  con-
           tinuation  line will place information starting at the
           time specified as the UNTIL field in the previous line
           in  the  file used by the previous line.  Continuation
           lines may contain an UNTIL field, just as  zone  lines
           do,  indicating  that  the next line is a further con-
           tinuation.
