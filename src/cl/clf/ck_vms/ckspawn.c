**  Name: CKSPAWN.C - Run a CK command of the host operating system
**
**  Description:
**	Run a CK command on the host operating system
**
**	    CK_spawn()    - spawn a CK command and wait
**	    CK_spawnnow() - spawn a CK command and do not wait
**	    CK_is_alive() - is a CK command alive?
**
**
**  History:
**      27-oct-1988 (anton)
**	    Created.
**	03-may-1989 (fredv)
** 	    For some reasons, IBM RT's system() call always gets an interrupt
**	 	signal and returns fail. Use our PCcmdline() works a lot 
**		better. So added a special case for IBM RT.
**	08-may-89 (daveb)
**		If system() doesn't work somewhere, but PCcmdline does,
**		just use PCcmdline everywhere.  Removed the ifdef for
**		rtp_us5 and made if the default.
**
**		It would have been better, in my opinion, to have
**		put this relatively general interface into PC rather
**		than burying it here in CK.  (You would want this
**		style call, because it has a CL_ERR_DESC, unlike
**		PCcmdline.)
**	25-sep-1990 (walt)
**	    (To fix bug 33419)
**	    Removed SYSPRV-setting code from CKrestore, CKsave [ck.c] and moved
**	    it here.  This is being done because CKbegin and CKend need to have
**	    the same functionality.  Rather than replicate the code two more
**	    times there in that file, I'm just moving it to this common place
**	    for them all to use.
**	15-oct-1990 (walt)
**	    Use PCcmdline's additional parameters.
**	18-dec-1990 (walt)
**	    On 25-oct-90 Sandyd integrated a previous version of this file that
**	    updated the old version to use the new PCcmdline parameters that
**	    are in this version.  The version being integrated today (18-dec-90)
**	    is the original file from which that change was taken.  It
**	    also contains many other changed lines.  Rather than merge this
**	    file's many changes into that one - just to preserve the one line
**	    previously integrated - this file is being integrated as a whole
**	    and includes the previously new version of the PCcmdline call.
**      16-jul-93 (ed)
**	    added gl.h
**	14-nov-96 (chech02)
**	    added CK_spawnnow() from UNIX for 2.0 port.
**	25-sep-98 (chash01/kinte01)
**          change CK_spawn() to PCspawn() so that
**          we can have child process running concurrently
**          with parent process. (93552)
**      27-Jun-2000 (horda03)
**          Enable SYSPRV (VMS) privilege before invoking a spawn
**          command. This privilege must be enables in EXEC or KRNL
**          mode. I've plumped for EXEC mode.
**	19-jul-2000 (kinte01)
**	    Correct prototype definitions by adding missing includes
**	01-dec-2000	(kinte01)
**		Bug 103393 - removed nat, longnat, u_nat, & u_longnat
**		from VMS CL as the use is no longer allowed
**	13-mar-2001 (kinte01)
**		Add new routine ck_is_alive
**		Rearranged headers (pc.h before ck.h) to pick up 
**		definition of PID
