This file is "II_CONFIG:CKTMPL.DEF".  It contains the user-provided commands
that ckpdb and rollforwarddb will use to run backups and restores.

In this file, empty lines and lines that don't start with 'B' 'W' or 'E' are
ignored and can be used as comments.


Line identifiers:
----------------

              1st: - The type of operation being carried out
                 I  = Begin Table Level Recovery (initialize only)
                 F  = End Table Level Recovery (comments only)
                 B  = Begin Operation ckpdb/rolldb
                 P  = Pre-Work on the Operation ckpdb/rolldb
                 E  = End Operation ckpdb/rolldb
                 W  = Work on the Operation ckpdb/rolldb

             2nd:- The type of direction associated to the operation
                 S  = Save (checkpoint)
                 R  = Restore (rollforward)
                 J  = Journal (Journal processing)
                 U  = Dump (Dump processing)
                 D  = Delete (delete file process)
                 C  = Snapshot (Check snapshot exists rollforward)

             3rd: - The device to be used
                 T  = Tape device
                 D  = Disk device

             4th:- Granularity
                 D  = Database level
                 A  = All databases
                 T  = Table Level (within a single database)



Here are the symbols that INGRES will substitute at run time:
------------------------------------------------------------

	    %A	    checkpoint name	    %C prepended to %F to form a
					    fully specified checkpoint file.

	    %B	    list of files
	    
	    %C	    checkpoint directory:   Pathname of the checkpoint directory
					    for disk operations.  (The device
					    name if to tape.)

	    %D	    database directory:	    Pathname of the database directory
					    being saved or restored.

	    %F	    checkpoint file	    Name of the checkpoint file.

	    %H	    Number of tables in a location

	    %I	    User specified string

	    %J0	    either REDO or UNDO processing
	      1	    First journal file
	      2	    Last journal file
	      3	    Journal pathname
              4	    Journal filename

	    %M	    Current location number 

	    %N	    location number:	    For the Begin or End phases this
					    is the total number of locations
					    being written.  During the Work
					    phase this starts at 1 and is
					    incremented after each location

	    %T	    type of operation:	    Set to '1' if tape, '0' if disk.

	    %U0	    First Dump file
	      1	    Last Dump file
	      2	    Pathname of dump file
	      3	    Dump filename

	    %X	    table name
