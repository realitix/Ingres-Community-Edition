/**
** Name: CSINTERNAL.H - Internal Control System Module definitions
**
** Description:
**
**	This header contains CS (Control System) definitions that are
**	global to all flavors of CS and CSMT, and perhaps even known to
**	other parts of the CL.  These are definitions that are *not*
**	exported outside of the CL.  Nor are they strictly private to
**	a particular CS implementation.
**
** History: $Log-for RCS$
**      29-Oct-1986 (fred)
**          Created.
**	26-sep-1988 (rogerk)
**	    Added thread priority constants.
**	31-oct-1988 (rogerk)
**	    Added CS_ACCNTING_MASK to server block cs_mask.  This specifies
**	    whether or not to write records to the accounting file for each
**	    dbms session.
**	    Added CS_CPUSTAT_MASK to server block cs_mask.  This specifies
**	    that the server should keep track of cpu times on a thread by
**	    thread basis.
**	 7-nov-1988 (rogerk)
**	    Added fields in the CS_SYSTEM control block in which asynchronous
**	    routines can write values without colliding with other threads.
**      28-feb-1989 (rogerk)
**          Added cs_pid field and stats for cross process semaphores to server
**          control block.
**      19-jul-89 (rogerk)
**          Added cs_event_mask to Cs_srv_block for clients of event routines.
**      16-oct-89 (fls-sequent)
**          Modified for MCT.
**	31-Oct-89 (anton)
**	    Change type of quantum in startup message.
**	22-Jan-90 (fredp)
**	    Integrated the following change:  27-jun-89 (daveb)
**	    Added CS_RESERVED_FDS -- a "best guess" at the max. number of 
**	    file descriptors that the server will use internally.
**	23-Jan-90 (anton)
**	    Increased size of cs_crb_buf due to size of GCA_LS_PARMS
**	17-may-90 (blaise)
**	    Integrated changes from ingresug:
**		Remove superfluous "typedef"s before structure declarations;
**		Size sc_sname according to GCC_L_PORT and include <gcccl.h>
**		to pick up the GCC_L_PORT length value.
**	21-mar-90 (fls-sequent)
**	    Added CS_GET_MY_SCB macro for MCT.
**	22-oct-90 (fls-sequent)
**	    Integrated changes from 63p CL:
**	        Increased size of cs_crb_buf due to size of GCA_LS_PARMS
**		Remove superfluous "typedef"s before structure declarations;
**		Size sc_sname according to GCC_L_PORT and include <gcccl.h>
**		to pick up the GCC_L_PORT length value.
**	4-jul-92 (daveb)
**		Add SPTREEs to CS_SYSTEM for scb, sem, and conditions.
**	26-jul-1993 (bryanp/keving)
**	    Changed number of options in CS_STARTUP_MSG to CS_OPTMAX.
**	1-Sep-1993 (seiwald)
**	    CS_OPTIONS and CS_STARTUP_MSG gone, as startup parameters no
**	    longer traverse the CL interface.  Added a few flags to the
**	    bottom of CS_SYSTEM to hold parameters once held in the
**	    startup message.  Commented as "defunct" cs_multiple in
**	    CS_SYSTEM, but didn't delete it: every csll.*.s depends on
**	    hardwired offsets into CS_SYSTEM!
**	20-sep-93 (mikem)
**	    Added 3 fields to the CS_SYSTEM segment to keep track of "nap"
**	    calls (nap's are cases when the server sleep's because another
**	    process owns the cross process semaphore it needs).  Also changed
**	    all the statistics counters from u_i4 to u_i4 as these
**	    counters can get very large (especially semaphore spin counts).
**	02-nov-93 (swm)
**	    Bug #56447
**	    Changed type of cs_used from i4  to CS_SID because it can be
**	    used to hold CS_SCB.cs_self.
**      31-jan-94 (mikem)
**          sir #57671
**	    Added 2 fields to CS_SYSTEM keep track of the unix specific 
**	    parameters to control transfer size of non-shared memory I/O 
**	    executed by the unix di slaves: cs_size_io_buf, cs_num_io_buf.
**	20-jul-95 (shero03)
**	    Masked off ADMIN_SCB for NT
**	14-Jun-1995 (jenjo02)
**	    Renamed cs_multiple (obsolete) to cs_hwm_active in which
**	    hwm of #threads on the run-queues is kept.
**      04-oct-1995 (wonst02)
**          Add cs_facility to CS_SYSTEM for the address of scs_facility().
** 	16-Jan-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Changed cs_sm_* to cs_tm_*. cs_sm_* wasn't being used, so
**	    cs_tm_* fields will be used to account for time-only  
**	    CSsuspend() wait reasons.
**	    Added cs_lge_*, cs_lke_* fields in which to track CSsuspend()
**	    calls on LK/LG events.
**	14-Mch-1996 (prida01)
**	    Add cs_diag to _CS_SYSTEM
**	03-jun-1996 (canor01)
**	    Modified for operating system threads.
**	    Add cs_facility to CS_SYSTEM for Unix as well as NT.
**	    Add synchronization for global splay trees.
**	13-Aug-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Modified cs_smstatistics in CS_SYSTEM to provide better-fit
**	    statistics for thread semaphores.
**	18-nov-1996 (canor01)
**	    Synchronization primitives in CS_SYSTEM for the splay trees are for
**	    OS-thread systems only.
**	10-dec-96 (hanch04)
**	    moved cs_facility, offset is hardcoded in cs.
**	5-dec-96 (stephenb)
**	    Add definition of CS_PROFILE to CS_SYSTEM for profiling.
**      18-feb-1997 (hanch04)
**          As part of merging of Ingres-threaded and OS-threaded servers,
**          CS_SYSTEM will contain both versions for SMSTAT
**	28-feb-1997 (hanch04)
**	    cs_mt will be part of CS_SYSTEM for threads or no threads
**	21-may-1997 (shero03)
**	    Add definition of CS_DEV_TRCENTRY for debugging
**	03-Jul-97 (radve01)
**	    Several fields added to the end of the server block in order to 
**	    facilitate debugging.
**	07-jul-1997 (canor01)
**	    Add lists of known semaphores.
**      21-jul-1997 (canor01)
**          If we are trying to reserve low file descriptors for stream i/o,
**          increase CS_RESERVED_FDS by 256 to reserve them outside all
**          other uses.
**	26-Aug-1997 (kosma01)
**	    For OS_THREADS_USED, cast special session ids into threads 
**	    friendly types. Also add a NULL session id CS_NULL_ID.
**	03-nov-1997 (canor01)
**	    Add support for using CS_alloc_stack to maintain stacks for
**	    OS threads.
**	01-Dec-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Added cs_rcp_pid, cs_get_rcp_pid  to CS_SYSTEM to provide the 
**	    identity of the RCP to CSMTp_semaphore() (OS threads only).
**      16-Feb-98 (fanra01)
**          Add attach and detach functions from IMA so that the structures
**          can be registered when the thread is active.
**	23-feb-1998 (canor01)
**	    Moved the fields from the last two changes to after the 
**	    cs_inkernel entry to prevent having to change hard-coded 
**	    offsets in assembler.
**	25-Feb-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Added cs_cnt_mutex to Orlan's above list.
**	09-Mar-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Moved CS_MAXPRIORITY, CS_MINPRIORITY, CS_DEFPRIORITY to
**	    csnormal.h to expose them to SCF.
**	24-Sep-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Eliminate cs_cnt_mutex, hold Cs_known_list_sem while adjusting
**	    session counts instead.
**	16-Nov-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Added new wait counts/times to CS_SYSTEM for Reads/Writes,
**	    Log I/O. Existing cs_bio/cs_dio stats retained for

**  02-Dec-1998 (muhpa01)
**	    Moved CS_NULL_ID so it's now defined for all (ie. non-OS_THREADS).
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	29-Sep-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Deleted cs_bio_time, cs_bio_waits, cs_bio_done, ditto
**	    for cs_dio?. These objects are now computed with (new)
**	    MO methods. Added cs_dio?_kbytes, cs_lio?_kbytes stats
**	    to help track I/O rates in the sampler.
**	05-sep-2002 (devjo01)
**	    Add 'cs_format_lkkey' to CS_SYSTEM.
**      07-July-2003 (hanje04)
**          BUG 110542 - Linux Only
**          Enable use of alternate stack for SIGNAL handler in the event
**          of SIGSEGV SIGILL and SIGBUS. pthread libraries do not like
**          the alternate stack to be malloc'd so declare it on IICSdispatch
**          stack for INTERNAL THREADS and localy for each thread in CSMT_setup
**          for OS threads. Defined CS_ALTSTK_SZ
**	12-apr-2004 (somsa010
**	    Updated cs_size to be a SIZE_TYPE in CS_SCB, to correspond
**	    to the changes made to SC0M_OBJECT.
**	26-nov-2008 (joea)

** Name: CS_SYSTEM - Overall control structure for the Control System
**
** Description:
**      This structure describes the overall control structure which is used 
**      throughout the CS module, and, therefore, is the central structure 
**      of the entire system in which the CS module is running.  This structure 
**      supplies the anchor points for the ready and wait queues in use in the 
**      system, the anchor for the list of known sessions, the anchor for the
**      connection request block list, and the location for numerous bits of 
**      interesting information about how things are running, etc.
**
**	This structure is referenced and possibly altered by any thread in
**	the system.  Any thread that alters information in the CS_SYSTEM
**	control block must take care that it is protected from changing
**	it at that same time as another thread.  Also, some CS routines
**	are triggered by asynchronous events and these also may alter fields
**	in the CS_SYSTEM control block.  There are three methods used by
**	the CS system to protect itself while changing CS_SYSTEM information.
**
**	    1) Turn off ASTs.  Since CS uses AST's to drive asynchronous
**	       events, no unexpected events can occur while we have AST's
**	       disabled.  This includes quantum based thread switching.  While
**	       ASTs are disabled, the current thread will not be switched out
**	       by the quantum timer - it can only be switched out if it
**	       asks to be.  A session may safely alter CS_SYSTEM control block
**	       fields while ASTs are disabled, but should always take care
**	       enable ASTs when done.
**
**	    2) Turn on cs_inkernel flag. This flag in the CS_SYSTEM control
**	       block specifies that the current session should not be switched
**	       out involuntarily.  Similar to turning off ASTs, when this
**	       flag is on the quantum timer will not switch the current thread
**	       out - the thread can only be switched out on request.  Note,
**	       however, that turning on the cs_inkernel flag does not prevent
**	       asynchronous CS routines from being called.
**
**	       A CS routine that is called directly by a thread (not by way
**	       of an AST) may alter most CS_SYSTEM control block information
**	       safely while the cs_inkernel flag is turned on.  The only
**	       fields that cannot be safely altered are the async field
**	       described below in method (3).  The CS routine should be
**	       careful to turn off the cs_inkernel flag when done, and to
**	       follow the protocol described in below in (3) regarding the
**	       async fields.
**
**	       Some CS routines run in the context of an AST.  These routines
**	       are CSresume, CSattn, and CSquantum.  These routines are
**	       protected from AST's, but since thay may be signalled while
**	       another thread was in the middle of altering CS_SYSTEM
**	       information, they may not change any fields that they want to.
**	       If an AST driven routine sees that the cs_inkernel field is not
**	       on, then it may safely alter any field in the CS control block.
**	       If an AST routine sees that the cs_inkernel field is ON, then
**	       it may alter NO FIELDS except for the async ones described below.
**
**	    3) Use of cs_async fields.  In the CS_SYSTEM control block are
**	       fields which can be used only by atomic routines which are
**	       protected from ASTs.  These fields are:  cs_async, cs_as_list,
**	       cs_scb_async_cnt, and cs_asadd_thread.  When an AST driven CS
**	       routine is called while the cs_inkernel flag is set, that routine
**	       may write only into these special CS_SYSTEM fields.  It must then
**	       make sure that the 'cs_async' field is ON.
**
**	       When a non-AST driven CS routine turns off the cs_inkernel flag,
**	       it must check the cs_async field of the CS_SYSTEM control block.
**	       If that field is set, then the CS routine must turn off AST's
**	       and move all information from the async fields into the regular
**	       portions of the CS_SYSTEM control block.
**
**	* Note * If you change any structure member offsets, and in particular
**		cs_current
**		cs_inkernel
**	Then you will have to fix all of the internal-threads ASM files.  I've
**	moved them to (near) the front to minimize the chances that they will
**	ever move again.  (Of course, now that we hardly ever use the
**	ASM internal thread switchers any more!)
**
** History:
**      27-Oct-1986 (fred)
**          Initial Definition.
**	 7-nov-1988 (rogerk)
**	    Added fields - cs_async, cs_as_list, cs_scb_async_cnt and
**	    cs_asadd_thread - for asynchronous routines to write information
**	    into.  This is to enable CS to do most operations without having
**	    to enable/disable asts.
**      28-feb-1989 (rogerk)
**          Added cs_pid field and stats for cross process semaphores.
**      19-jul-89 (rogerk)
**          Added cs_event_mask to Cs_srv_block for clients of event routines.
**      16-oct-89 (fls-sequent)
**          Modified for MCT.
**	23-Jan-90 (anton)
**	    Increased size of cs_crb_buf due to size of GCA_LS_PARMS
**	20-sep-93 (mikem)
**	    Added 3 fields to the CS_SYSTEM segment to keep track of "nap"
**	    calls (nap's are cases when the server sleep's because another
**	    process owns the cross process semaphore it needs).  Also changed
**	    all the statistics counters from u_i4 to u_i4 as these
**	    counters can get very large (especially semaphore spin counts).
**      31-jan-94 (mikem)
**          sir #57671
**	    Added 2 fields to CS_SYSTEM keep track of the unix specific 
**	    parameters to control transfer size of non-shared memory I/O 
**	    executed by the unix di slaves: cs_size_io_buf, cs_num_io_buf.
**      25-oct-1995 (thaju02/stoli02)
**          Added wait on CSEVENT counter.
** 	16-Jan-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Changed cs_sm_* to cs_tm_*. cs_sm_* wasn't being used, so
**	    cs_tm_* fields will be used to account for time-only  
**	    CSsuspend() wait reasons.
**	    Added cs_lge_*, cs_lke_* fields in which to track CSsuspend()
**	    calls on LK/LG events.
**	13-Aug-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Modified cs_smstatistics in CS_SYSTEM to provide better-fit
**	    statistics for thread semaphores.
**	18-nov-1996 (canor01)
**	    Synchronization primitives for the splay trees are for
**	    OS-thread systems only.
**	03-Jul-97 (radve01)
**	    Several fields added to the end of the server block in order to
**	    facilitate debugging.
**	18-nov-1996 (canor01)
**	    Synchronization primitives for the splay trees are for
**	    OS-thread systems only.
**	01-Dec-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Added cs_rcp_pid, cs_get_rcp_pid  to CS_SYSTEM to provide the 
**	    identity of the RCP to CSMTp_semaphore() (OS threads only).
**	31-jul-1998 (canor01)
**	    Need to include pc.h for PID definition.
**	24-Sep-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Eliminate cs_cnt_mutex, hold Cs_known_list_sem while adjusting
**	    session counts instead.
**	16-Nov-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Added new wait counts/times to CS_SYSTEM for Reads/Writes,
**	    Log I/O. Existing cs_bio/cs_dio stats retained for 
**	    compatibility.
**	29-Sep-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Deleted cs_bio_time, cs_bio_waits, cs_bio_done, ditto
**	    for cs_dio?. These objects are now computed with (new)
**	    MO methods. Added cs_dio?_kbytes, cs_lio?_kbytes stats
**	    to help the sampler track I/O rates.
**	13-Feb-2007 (kschendel)
**	    Added wall-clock ticker so that servers have an independently
**	    running clock.  (for OS-threaded only.)
