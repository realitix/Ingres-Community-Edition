/**
** Name: CSSMINFO.H - System wide information about shared memory segments
**
** Description:
**	The dbms server maintain 3 shared memory segments per server.
**
**	The first shared memory segment "system control block" will maintain
**	information necessary to find all the other shared memory segments.
**	It will also contain fields which are particular to each server in
** 	the installation.  This segment is mapped by every process which
**	uses any sort of shared memory or needs to use the CS event mechanism
**	(ie. dbms server, dbms slaves, acp, and recovery process.)
**	This shared memory segment may be mapped anywhere possible in a process
**	since it will only contain position independant data structures.
**	This shared memory segment is created by an program run at installation
**	startup time.  Programs will map to it using an id derived from the
**	II_INSTALLATION variable.
**
**	The second shared memory segment contains both the logging and locking
**	tables.  It's layout contains first a control block used to manage the
**	segments memory, then the locking control block "LKD" and
**	then the logging control block "LGD".  Following these control 
**	structures is basically heap space maintained by the logging and locking
**	code.  This shared memory segment currently must be mapped to the same 
**	address in every process (this address can is found in the "system 
**	control block").  This shared memory segment is also created by a 
**	program run at installation startup time.  Programs will map to it using
**	an id derived from the II_INSTALLATION variable.  Only users of the
**	logging and locking will have to map this segment (ie. dbms server,
**	acp, and recovery process - dbms slaves will definitiely not have to 
**	map this memory thus making them much smaller).
**
**	The last shared memory segment is allocated one per server.  This 
**	segment contains all shared memory needed by a server.  Information
**	stored in this includes slave/server interaction, event mechanisms,
**	and perhaps eventually dbms buffer manager.  This segment is 
**	dynamically created by the server at server startup time.  Only the
**	dbms server and the dbms slaves should have to map this segment in.
**	This segment should only contain position independent data structures,
**	and so can be mapped to any address in a process.
**
** History: 
**      25-jan-88 (mmm)
**          Created.
**	15-feb-89 (mmm)
**	    bumped CSS_VERSION to 610008.  This was done because the LGK 
**	    control segment changed.
**	21-Jul-89 (anton)
**	    Bumped CSS_VERSION to 700001 for terminator.
**	10-aug-89 (mikem)
**	    Bumped CSS_VERSION to 700002, after changing the size of the
**	    LGK_ACB structure.
**      15-jan-90 (fls-sequent)
**          Added csi_wakeme_pid for MCT server.
**	18-jan-90 (mikem)
**	    Bumped CSS_VERSION to 700003, after changing the size of the
**	    LGD for online checkpoint changes/NSE bug fix integration.
**	23-mar-90 (mikem)
**	    Bumped CSS_VERSION to 700004, after changing the size of the
**	    LGD for added performance stat gathering.
**      17-may-90 (blaise)
**        Integrated changes from 61 and ug:
**            Force error if <clconfig.h> has not been not included;
**            Remove superfluous typdefs before structure declarations;
**	17-may-90 (rogerk)
**	    Bumped CSS_VERSION to 700005, after changing the size of the
**	    lgd_buffer field of LGD.
**      26-jun-90 (fls-sequent)
**	    Changed CS atomic locks to SHM atomic locks.
**      26-jun-90 (fls-sequent)
**	    Bumped CSS_VERSION to 700006 for MCT.
**      22-oct-90 (fls-sequent)
**	    Integrated changes from 63p CL:
**		Force error if <clconfig.h> has not been not included.
**		Remove superfluous typdefs before structure declarations.
**		Add code to handle Convex semaphores (xCL_078_CVX_SEM).
**	4-june-90 (blaise)
**	    Integrated changes from termcl code line:
**		Bumped up CSS_VERSION to 700005.
**	30-Jan-91 (anton)
**	    Set CSS_VERSION to 630401
**	    Put in MCT support
**	11-apr-91 (gautam)
**	    Changed csi_connect_id to char[64] to allow for large connect ids
**	26-apr-1991 (bryanp)
**	    Updated CSS_VERSION to 630402 to reflect change in csi_connect_id.
**	6-aug-1991 (bryanp)
**	    Updated CSS_VERSION to 630403 to reflect changes in DI_SLAVE_CB.
**	3-march-1992 (jnash)
**          Updated CSS_VERSION to 630404 to reflect changes in DI_SLAVE_CB.
**	20-sep-1993 (mikem)
**	    Updated CSS_VERSION to 650102 to reflect new size of CS_SEMAPHORE
**	    (and thus new size's of all shared memory segments which contain
**	    CS_SEMAPHORE's).
**	31-jan-1994 (mikem)
**	    Updated CSS_VERSION to 650103 to reflect new size of CS_SMCNTRL
**	    which had the css_wakeup field added.
**	20-apr-1994 (mikem)
**	    Updated CSS_VERSION to 650104 to reflect new size of CS_SMCNTRL
**	    which had the css_clock field added.
**      12-Dec-95 (fanra01)
**          Added IMPORT_DLL_DATA section for references by statically built
**          code to data in DLL.
**	03-jun-1996 (canor01)
**	    Change to use operating system thread synchronization objects
**	    when operating system threads are enabled.
**	16-Nov-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Relocated CS_SM_WAKEUP_CB to cl/hdr/hdr/csnormal.h where it is
**	    now referenced by CS_SCB.
**	30-may-2000 (toumi01)
**	    Add csi_signal_pid field.  This is the pid for sending signals.
**	    If the server is not threaded, or if the OS server model
**	    runs all threads under the same pid, then csi_signal_pid
**	    will be equal to csi_pid.  However, this new field is needed
**	    for servers where the main thread and idle thread pids can
**	    be different because of the 1:1 thread model (e.g. Linux).
**	    In effect, this change undoes the overloading of csi_pid to
**	    mean both the pid of the main server thread and the pid of
**	    the thread that can receive (e.g. SIGUSR2) signals.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	19-Aug-2009 (kschendel) 121804
**	    Update some of the function declarations to fix gcc 4.3 problems.
**	29-Sep-2009 (frima01) 121804
**	    Add CS_get_cb_dbg prototype to avoid warnings from gcc 4.3
**	15-Nov-2010 (kschendel) SIR 124685
**	    Prototype / include fixes.
