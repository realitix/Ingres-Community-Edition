/**CL_SPEC
** Name: CSEV.H - CS event handling structures
**
** Description:
**	Definitions used by the internal CL routines of CS and its clients
**	(GC, LK, LG, DI).
**
** Specification:
**  
**  Motivation:
** 
**	CS needs to provide a mechanism by which its clients can perform
**	non-blocking operations on an OS (UNIX) which does not support
**	user-controlled	asynchronous events.
**
**  Description:
**	
**	CS is used to:
**	    o sleep threads, blocked waiting on a particular event.
**	    o wake up threads waiting on events (put to sleep by CSsuspend).
**	    o recognize and handle completion of events.
**	    o put the dbms server to sleep.
**	    o post events to the dbms server (waking it if necessary).
**	    o manage slave processes for for its clients
**	    o request events of slave processes
**
**  Intended Uses:
**
**	CS is used by the UNIX CL modules (CS, GC, DI, LG, and LK) to
**	distribute functions, such as I/O to other processes.  Async
**	operations on UNIX will be implemented by using slave processes
**	to perform the operation.  Communication between the dbms server and 
**	the slave(s) will be through shared memory and semaphores.
**	
**	
**	Actions taken by the DBMS:
**	
**	  o Thread continues until it has to make a blocking procedure call.
**	
**	  o post request to slave process
**	
**	  o either call CSsuspend to sleep thread (DI, LG, LK) or return to 
**	    caller (invoker of GC might call CSsuspend waiting for reactivation
**	    via the call of the exit routine).
**	
**	  o time goes by and eventually the dbms calls CS_find_events to check
**	    to see if events have completed.
**
**	  o if (events have completed)
**		foreach (event that has completed)
**		{
**	    	    call completion handler for that event
**		}
**
**	        o completion handler will finish event's operation
**	          (copy buffers from communication channel,
**		   resume thread via CSresume ...)
**
**	        o event handler :(DI, LK, LG) resume threads
**	               	         (GC) call exit routine for session which
**				  completed event exit routine will most
**				  probably call CSresume which will move
**				  session to run queue.
**
**	    o if (threads runable)
**		schedule a thread
**	      else
**		sleep waiting for an event.
**
**	Actions taken by SLAVE process:
**
**	 o wait for a request from the dbms server to be delivered
**
**	 o while procesing request, other requests may be queued by the server.
**
**	 o block waiting for completion of request (completed I/O) 
**
**	 o Indicate in shared memory and semaphore that request is completed
**
**	 o Post event to dbms server.
**
**	 o Sleep waiting for requests.
**
**
**	Examples processes:
**
**		DI slaves:
**
**		DBMS will fork a "configurable" number of DI slaves.  
**		Each slave communicates with the DBMS through a shared
**		memory segment and is responsible for moving data buffers
**		to/from disk and the shared segments.  These I/O operations
**		will block in the slave.  The slave will
**		notify the server that an operation has completed and will
**		indicate which event was completed.
**		Completion status of the operation is communicated
**		to the server through shared memory, and will eventually be
**		stored a status variable provided by the caller in the server.
**
**		GC slave (socket implementation):
**
**		DBMS will fork a single GC slave.  This slave will maintain
**		a single I/O control block for each connected user to the
**		server in shared memory.  Sockets will be used as the
**		communication channel.  Select will be
**		used to determine if a channel can be read or written in a
**		non-block operation.  The channel will be marked as 
**		non-blocking so that writes will not block the server (a 
**		select may indicate that a channel is writable, but it may not
**		allow the entire block to be written - in that case a partial
**		write will be performed and GC will have to keep track and
**		write the rest of the block when the select indicates it can).
**
**		The GC slave will normally be sleeping on a select.  
**		Whenever the select completes it will process the I/O and post
**		a notice to the server.  The dbms will require a way of
**		interrupting the select to post requests of the GC slave.
**		This can be done by connecting to a socket and sending
**		the message down the socket to the GC slave.
**		
**
**	How to use CS events:
**		
**		To use CS events a process must have a certain amount of
**		shared memory
**		mapped into its address space.  This memory is accessible to 
**		every process using CS within a single installation.
**		This memory is mapped by the CSinitiate() call.  Every user of
**		CS (both servers and slaves) must call CSinitiate() before any
**		other CS routine.
**
**		The requests of CS are driven by "events".
**		Each event is identified by a control block and a slave block
**		which holds locks and handler functions and other information.
**		These handlers are called by the dbms upon event completion.
**	
**		Clients of CS are expected to implement non-blocking CL
**		components through the use of slaves (other unix processes).
**		UNIX DBMS CL implementations will either block using CSsuspend
**		after causeing an event for the slave or will maintain
**		exit routines to be called by event handlers on completion of
**		the request.
**
**		Clients of CS events will resume operation following the
**		completion of an event request by completion handlers either
**		calling CSresume or an appropriate exit handler routine.
**
**		The DBMS will poll for events using CS_find_events() whenever
**		performing session context switches (ie. I/O, lock requests).
**		More polls may be implemented if further research indicates
**		necessity (during long in memory sorts, long optimizations).
**
**		When the DBMS recognizes completion of an event it will call
**		the provided handler, set up by the CS users in CSslaveinit.c.
**
**		Slaves of users of CS post event completion to the DBMS
**		implicitly by the return of handlers in slave processes.
**		This action will later cause CS_find_events in the DBMS to
**		call the handler provided in a call to CSslave_init.
**		Active posting of events to servers are not directly
**		provided yet but appear to be easy.
**
**		Note: The first implementation of this will not garantee that
**		users may use memory other than the event control blocks
**		for communication between slave and server.
**
**    Assumptions:
**	shared memory and counting semaphores between UNIX processes.
**		(Sys V shmem and semaphores)
**
**    Definitions:
**	  
**	  server	- DBMS server process
**
**	  slave		- subprocess of a DBMS server used to perform operations
**			  (reads, writes, ..) that would block.
**
**	  request	- the operation that the slave performs for the DBMS.
**
**	  event		- a communication mechanism through which the 
**			  DBMS informs a slave and is informed by a slave
**			  that a request has completed.

**      3-15-89 (markd)
**          Changed CS_ACLR macro as CS_relspin for SEQUENT.
**          Atmoically set locks must be unset atomically on Symmetry.
**          CS_relspin is an assembler routine defined in csll.s 
**
**	19-jan-88 (jaa)
**	    Revised and renamed for encapsilation into CS
**
**      Revision 1.2  87/09/29  17:40:21  mikem
**      greg's changes.
**      
**      28-sep-87 (mmm)
**	    Created.
**	31-jan-1989 (roger)
**	    Renamed executable to "iislave".
**	15-feb-1989 (mikem)
**	    Changed algorithm for figuring out size of shared memory to 
**	    allocate CSEV_MSIZE to better reflect the actual size of the
**	    objects being allocated.  The problem was that the DI_SLAVE_CB
**	    contains a CL_ERR_DESC which has grown in size.  For now we will
**	    change the extimate to reflect current reality - a better long
**	    term solution would be to add to the interface a way for the the
**	    event system users to indicate the size of the buffers they will
**	    be using before the shared memory segment has to be allocated.
**	10-Mar-1989 (fredv)
**	    Tset operation of RT is on 2 bytes. Defined CS_ASET as i2 for RT.
**	20-mar-89 (russ)
**	    Changed bzero to MEfill.
**	20-jul-89 (rogerk)

**		Force an error if <clconfig.h> is not included;
**		Remove the default case of CS_ACLR, to force the definition
**		of an atomic clear operation;
**		Added specific cases for hp8_us5, sqs_us5, arx_us5, dr6_us5;
**		Remove superfluous "typedef" before struct _CS_SPIN;
**		Add code for new type of semaphores (xCL_078_CVX_SEM).

**		Add machine-specific support for su4_u42.
**	7-june-90 (blaise)
**	    Moved atomic test & set type and atomic test & set op definitions
**	    to <cs.h>. The atomic test & set type definitions for most boxes
**	    were in cs.h anyway.
**      4-sep-90 (jkb)
**	    Define CS_relspin for sqs_ptx
**      30-oct-90 (rog)
**	    Added VOLATILE to the definition of CSEV_CB to prevent code

**	    Add declaration of CSdef_resume
**      10-jan-91 (jkb)
**          Increase the value of NSVSEMS from 10 to 30 to allow more

**      10-jan-91 (jkb)
**          Increase the value of NSVSEMS from 10 to 30
**	30-Jan-91 (anton)
**	    Merge in MCT support
**	08-mar-91 (rudyw)
**	    Add odt_us5 to the list of machines not defining CS_relspin
**	    Reduce number of NSVSEMS to 25 for odt_us5 to ODT system limit.
**	15-nov-1991 (bryanp)
**	    Increase CSEV_MSIZE estimates to allow for growth in DI_SLAVE_CB.
**	06-nov-92 (mikem)
**	    Added su4_us5 to the list of machines which define CS_relspin()
**	    in assembler.
**      12-nov-92 (terjeb)

**	    defining CS_relspin at this point.
**	26-jul-1993 (bryanp)
**	    Increase MAXSERVERS to 128. This is the nineties, after all...

**	    sir #57671
**	    As part of making the size of server segment configurable by PM
**	    variables changed the CSEV_MSIZE macro to accept 2 arguments:
**	    the number of slave control blocks and the size of the data portion
**	    of the slave control blocks.
**	10-feb-1994 (ajc)
**	    Added hp8_bls specific entries based on hp8*
**	17-jul-1995 (morayf)
**	    Add sos_us5 to the list of machines which needs to avoid
**	    defining CS_relspin at this point.
**	12-dec-1995 (morayf)
**	    Add SNI RMx00 (rmx_us5) to those not using CS_relspin macro.
**	    However, shouldn't need to limit NSVSEMS below 30 on RMx00.
**	02-mar-1996 (morayf)
**	    Made pym_us5 like rmx_us5 except keep NSVSEMS at 25 as this
**	    is default kernel limit.

** Name: CS_SPIN - Spinlock structure
**
** Description:
**	This structure holds all information assocated with a spin lock
**	Spinlocks are used as a last resort syncronizing method to prevent
**	two processes accessing the same data structure in an improper
**	mannor.  Spinlocks should only be held for VERY short sections
**	of code.
**
**	NOTICE: This structure must match the assembly code in csll.s
**
** History:
**      25-jul-88 (anton)
**          Created.
**	15-mar-89 (markd)
**	    Changed so CS_relspin is not defined as a macro
**	    for SEQUENT.  On the Symmetry CS_relspin must be an
**	    atomic clear, and it is written in assembler in csll.s.
**      01-oct-90 (chsieh)
**	    Changed so CS_relspin is not defined as a macro
**	    for bu2_us5 and bu3_us5. Same as su4_u42, and sqs_us5, sqs_u42 .... 
**	30-Jan-91 (anton)
**	    This is defined in shmlock.h for MCT
**	08-mar-91 (rudyw)
**	    Add odt_us5 to the list of machines which needs to avoid
**	    defining CS_relspin at this point.
**	06-nov-92 (mikem)
**	    Added su4_us5 to the list of machines which define CS_relspin()
**	    in assembler.
**      12-nov-92 (terjeb)
**	    Add hp8_us5 to the list of machines which needs to avoid
**	    defining CS_relspin at this point.
**	9-aug-93 (robf)
**          Add su4_cmw 
**	10-feb-1994 (ajc)
**	    Added hp8_bls specific entries based on hp8*
**	17-jul-1995 (morayf)
**	    Add sos_us5 to the list of machines which needs to avoid
**	    defining CS_relspin at this point.
**	18-feb-1998 (toumi01)
**	    Add Linux (lnx_us5) to platforms using csll.s CS_relspin.
**      28-Jul-1998 (linke01)
**          Adopt morayf's change described above for sui_us5
**	22-Dec-2004 (bonro01)
**	    Solaris a64_sol does not use this CS_relspin(), we use the
**	    one defined in csnormal.h
**	05-Feb-2008 (hanje04)
**	    SIR OSXSI
**	    Don't define CS_relspin() for OSX, defined in csnormal.h
**	23-Nov-2010 (kschendel)
**	    Drop a few more obsolete ports.
