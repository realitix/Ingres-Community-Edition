/*NMgetenv - return a pointer to the value of a logical name.
**
**	success: return pointer to value of logical name.
**	failure: return NULL pointer.
**
**	history:
**		9/83 -- (dd) written
**      06-Apr-1987 (fred)
**          Updated to VMS v4 lnm standards
**	12-nov-1991 (bryanp)
**	    Fixed three bugs:
**		1) When circular name definition occurred, this routine would
**		   simply loop forever. Standard VMS utilities will typically
**		   translate no further than 9-11 iterations before ceasing
**		   logical name translation. I changed this routine to stop
**		   logical name translation after 100 iterations and return
**		   NULL (NULL seems as good an answer as any...)
**		2) The code which attempted to handle the special process
**		   permanent filename translations (sys$input, etc.) was
**		   broken. I fixed it and added some comments to it. I don't
**		   know if this code is ever used; it's apparently been doing
**		   this for years...
**		3) (while I was here) increased the internal buffer lengths
**		    from 66 bytes to 256 bytes to handle 255 character names.
**
**      16-jul-93 (ed)
**	    added gl.h
**      11-aug-93 (ed)
**          added missing includes
**	19-jul-2000 (kinte01)
**	   Correct prototype definitions by adding missing includes and
**	   external function references
**	26-jun-2001 (loera01)
**	   Update for multiple product builds
**	17-sep-2001 (kinte01)
**	   STlength now returns a size_t value
**	29-aug-2003 (abbjo03)
**	    Changes to use VMS headers provided by HP.
**	09-oct-2008 (stegr01/joea)
**	    Replace II_VMS_ITEM_LIST_3 by ILE3.
**	12-feb-2010 (abbjo03, wanfr01) Bug 123139
**	    cv.h shoudl be used for function definitions
