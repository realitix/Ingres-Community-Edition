** EXCATCH.C -		EXdeclare establishes EXcatch as the generic condition
**			handler to the operating system for all conditions
**			(exceptions).  EXcatch calls the user-provided handler,
**			looks at the status returned, then returns an appropriate
**			return code to the operating system.
**      History:
**
**          25-jun-1993 (huffman)
**              Change include file references from xx.h to xxcl.h.
**	    02-aug-1993 (walt)
**		Log received exceptions to help track looping server.
**	    02-aug-1993 (walt)
**		Special case:  if exargs.exarg_num is 0x10A32 (68146.) then
**		set exargs.exarg_count to zero.  This wasn't necessary on VAX
**		because we didn't copy the arguments to a separate place for
**		the user handler like we do here.
**	    06-aug-1993 (walt)
**		If we're called during an unwind, delete our record of the
**		user's handler because the frame is going to be deleted.
**	    10-aug-1993 (walt)
**		Turn the generic Alpha exception SS$_HPARITH into a matching
**		CL error so it doesn't just get passed over as an unrecognized
**		exception.  Also set exarg_count to zero for exceptions where
**		there's no arguments to copy to the user (signal array argument
**		count <= 3).
**	    11-aug-1993 (walt)
**		Make invo_value an i8 rather than just an int.  sys$goto_unwind
**		takes 64 bits from the address of invo_value and moves them
**		into R0 during a nonlocal goto.  If any of the high bits of
**		invo_value become set somehow, then a statement of the form
**		"if (EXdeclare( ...) == EXDECLARE" fails because the internal
**		return value isn't *exactly* EXDECLARE in all 64 bits.
**	    07-nov-1994 (markg)
**		Fixed the method of passing arguments to the user handler.
**		The problem was caused by incorrect values being passed to 
**		lib$signal in EXsignal(). Also backed out Walt's change of
**		02-aug-1993 as this is no longer required.
**	    31-mar-1995 (dougb)
**		Integrate Mark's change from the 6.4 codeline.  Note: the
**		real problem here is in what's passed to a handler routine
**		such as EXcatch() -- we don't want the arg count twice.  I
**		also restored logic which ensures the argument count doesn't
**		go negative (just in case...), which isn't in the 6.4 version.
**	    3-apr-1995 (dougb)
**		Make sure registers are restored as of the
**		lib$get_current_invo_context() call in the EXdeclare() macro.
**	    26-jul-1995 (dougb)
**		Do *not* continue after a problem we can't fix up.  In
**		particular, arithmetic and MTH$ routine errors must cause
**		EX_CONTINUE from the user handler to be ignored.  We chose
**		to resignal instead.
**		There is no way on this pipelined machine to determine
**		exactly which instruction caused an arithmetic fault and to
**		correct the offending operand (there's no lib$fixup_flt()
**		routine).  While a MTH$ routine signalling a problem may be
**		on the stack above us, it is not a simple matter to
**		determine where its return value will be placed to fix it
**		up.  Both of these types of fixups would be performed on
**		Vax/VMS.  Some Unix boxes must be similar to Alpha VMS --
**		what do they do?
**		??? Should spend some time finding a way to fix up MTH$
**		??? return values.  That at least sounds possible.
**	    23-aug-1995 (duursma)
**		Two changes:
**		(1) With the reimplementation of MH.C (calling C runtimes instead
**		of MTH$ and OTS$ routines), MTH$ exceptions should never occur
**		again.  If they do, TRdisplay() an error message.  And as before,
**		don't allow EX_CONTINUE from such an exception.
**		(2) Don't restore scratch registers (R22-R24).  They were probably
**		not saved to begin with
**	    10-oct-1995 (duursma/dougb)
**		Performance improvements:
**		    Avoid all calls to lib$get_curr_invo_context() and
**		lib$get_prev_invo_context().  Move the call to
**		lib$get_invo_handle() out of the stack-walking loop.  Replace
**		the call to EXfind_handler() with the new i_EXtop() and
**		i_EXnext() routines.
** 	    03-jun-1997 (teresak/schang)
**		Bug 81931: Certain queries will cause the DBMS server to
**		access violate inside an OpenVMS 7.x system call because
**	        a data structure that originated from OpenVMS system calls 
**		was modifed and therefore the data returned to other system 
**		calls was invalid.
**	    09-nov-1999 (kinte01)
**	        Rename EX_CONTINUE to EX_CONTINUES per AIX 4.3 porting change
**	19-jul-2000 (kinte01)
**	    Correct prototype definitions by adding missing includes and
**	    external function references
**	01-dec-2000	(kinte01)
**	    Bug 103393 - removed nat, longnat, u_nat, & u_longnat
**	    from VMS CL as the use is no longer allowed
**	18-May-2001 (hanje04)
**	    When crossing 447895 from oping20 to main changed iijmpbuf
**	    back to jmpbuf. Now change it back to iijmpbuf again
**      15-Jan-2007 (horda03) Bug 117486
**          Catch IMGDMP signals. There occur when the SET PROC/DUMP
**          command is executed against a process. If we catch this
**          signal, so a stack dump and continue normal processing.
**	18-jun-2008 (joea)
**	    Correct EX_CONTINUES to EX_CONTINUE as done on Unix and Windows.
**      22-dec-2008 (stegr01)
**          Itanium VMS port.
**	05-jun-2009 (joea)
**	    Conditionally reinstate previous Alpha version. Make #ifdefs
**	    depend on release identifier rather than other constants. Reformat
**	    some lines for readability.
**      17-jun-2009 (stegr01)
**          replace sys$goto_unwind_64 with longjmp for Itanium
**          The C RTL setjmp/longjmp code contains a call to Itanium assembler 
**          to correctly restore scratch registers which apparently the sys$goto_unwind
**          fails to do
**          As a result of this surplus code has been removed
**	30-jun-2009 (joea)
**	    Re-merge Unix function signatures.
**      17-Aug-2009 (horda03) B122474
**          Trying to assign a FLOAT to a too large a value causes a SS$_HPARITH
**          exception, so once detected what the exception is for, convert to the
**          exception value Ingres expects.
**      17-nov-2009 (stegr01)
**          move a couple of variables to the top of a for loop to avoid 
**          compiler complaints
**      16-jun-2010 (joea)
**          Revert most of the 17-jun-2009 change. Use current chf$signal_array
**          member names and other changes to eliminate compiler warnings.
**      13-Jul-2011 (hanal04) SIR 125458
**          Update cs_elog calls inline with sc0e_putAsFcn changes.
