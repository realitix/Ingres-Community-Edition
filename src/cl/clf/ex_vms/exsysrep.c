** Name:	EXsetclient - Set client information for the EX subsystem
**
** Description:
**	This routine informs the EX subsystem as to the type of client

**	important in that it allows EX to modify its behavior dependent
**	on the client
**
**	For user applications, EX will only intercept access violation and
**	floating point exceptions.  This becomes the default behavior for EX.
**	It is up to the user application to deal with any other exceptions.
**
**	If the client is the Ingres DBMS, then EX will need to intercept
**	any exceptions that will cause a process to exit (current behavior).
**
**	In the case of Ingres Tools, EX will also intercept user generated
**	exit exceptions (such as interrupt) in addition to the access
**
**	FOR VMS, THIS ROUTINE IS A NO-OP.
**
** Inputs:
**	EX_INGRES_DBMS		Client is the Ingres DBMS or any application
**				that desires the trap all behavior.
**
**	EX_INGRES_TOOL		Client is one of the Ingres Tools.
**
**	EX_USER_APPLICATION	Client is a user written application.  This
**				is actually unnecessary since this is the
**				default.  It is defined here just for
**				completeness.
**
** Outputs:
**
**	Returns:
**		EX_OK			If everything succeeded.
**		EXSETCLIENT_LATE	If the EX subsystem has already
**					been initialized when this is called.
**		EXSETCLIENT_BADCLEINT	If an unknown client was passed in.

**	None.

** Side Effects:
**	None.
