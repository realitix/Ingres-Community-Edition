/**
**
**  Name: CSEF.C - Control System Event Flag routines.
**
**  Description:
**	This module contains the CS event flag routines.
**
**	The routines that drive the event mechanisms are:
**
**	    CS_ef_set	: set event wait flag for current session
**	    CS_ef_wait	: suspend current session until event is signalled
**	    CS_ef_wake	: signal event - wake up sessions waiting for event
**	    CS_ef_cancel: cancel current session's event wait flag
**
**	After calling CS_ef_set, the client must call either CS_ef_wait or
**	CS_ef_cancel.  Failing to do this will cause the system to get its
**	suspends and resumes out of sync.
**
**	The client of the event routines must be careful of the case where
**	the event desired occurs BEFORE the call to CS_ef_set.  If this
**	case cannot be handled by the client, then the calls to the event
**	routines should be protected by some sort of semaphore, as shown below.
**
**	The CS event routines are not intended to be high traffic - ultra fast
**	event drivers, they are used primarily to wait for out-of-resource
**	conditions to be resolved - these are not expected to happen very often.**
**	Event flag values should be reserved in CS.H.
**	Event waits are NOT interruptable.
**
**	The correct method for using the CS event routines is shown here (Note
**	that for brevity I have left out error checking - this doesn't condone
**	doing such in code).
**
**	    **
**	    ** Set semaphore before checking for resource, this prevents the
**	    ** race condition where the resource is freed immediately after
**	    ** we check for it, but before we set the wait flag.
**	    **
**	    CSp_semaphore(&Resource_semaphore);
**
**	    while ( ! resource_avialable)
**	    {
**		CS_ef_set(EVENT_FLAG);
**
**		** Release semaphore while waiting for event completion. **
**		CSv_semaphore(&Resource_semaphore);
**		CS_ef_wait();
**
**		CSp_semaphore(&Resource_semaphore);
**	    }
**
**	When releasing the resource:
**
**	    CSp_semaphore(&Resource_semaphore);
**	    free_resource();
**	    CS_ef_wake();	** Wake up anybody waiting for resource **
**	    CSv_semaphore(&Resource_semaphore);

**	09-nov-1992 (mikem)
**	    su4_us5 port.  Using same compiler as su4_u42 so added NO_OPTIM
**	    entry.
**	15-jul-93 (ed)
**	    adding <gl.h> after <compat.h>
**	9-aug-93 (robf)
**          add su4_cmw to NO_OPTIM
**      01-sep-1993 (smc)
**              Changed casts of sid to CS_SID.
**      24-jul-1996 (canor01)
**          integrate changes from cs.
**	06-sep-1996 (canor01)
**	    use scb->cs_self for sid, instead of scb with a cast.
**      18-feb-1997 (hanch04)
**          As part of merging of Ingres-threaded and OS-threaded servers,
**          use csmt version of this file.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4

**	    Delete CS_SYSTEM ref, get from csinternal.
**     13-Jul-2011 (hanal04) SIR 125458
**         Update cs_elog calls inline with sc0e_putAsFcn changes.

** Name: CS_ef_wait - wait for specified event to occur.
**
** Description:
**	This routine suspends the current thread until a specified event
**	occurs.  The event must have been set using the CS_ef_set call before
**	the thread can call CS_ef_wait.  The event must be signaled by some
**	other thread calling CS_ef_wake with the same event flag.
**
**	The routines that drive the event mechanisms are:
**
**	    CS_ef_set	: set event wait flag for current session
**	    CS_ef_wait	: suspend current session until event is signalled
**	    CS_ef_wake	: signal event - wake up sessions waiting for event
**	    CS_ef_cancel: cancel current session's event wait flag
**
**	After calling CS_ef_set, the client must call either CS_ef_wait or
**	CS_ef_cancel.  Failing to do this will cause the system to get its
**	suspends and resumes out of sync.
**
**	The client of the event routines must be careful of the case where
**	the event desired occurs BEFORE the call to CS_ef_set.  If this
**	case cannot be handled by the client, then the calls to the event
**	routines should be protected by some sort of semaphore, as shown below.

**	conditions to be resolved - these are not expected to happen very often.**
**	Event flag values should be reserved in CS.H.

**      none
