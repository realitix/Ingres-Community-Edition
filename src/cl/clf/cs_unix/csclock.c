/**
**
**  Name: CSCLOCK.C - routine's to manipulate CS's shared memory "clock".
**
**  Description:
**	The UNIX CS implementation requires cheap access to a system "clock"
**	with at least millisecond granularity.  Currently CS uses this access
**	to service frontend client timeout requests (lock timeout with
**	second granularity), thread internal timeout requests (group commit 
**	thread timeout of millisecond granularity - CSms_thread_nap()), and
**	other timeouts.
**	The CS scheduler maintains a "timeout" queue, and places any threads
**	which have requested timeout on this queue.  If the timeout queue is
**	non-empty the scheduler checks everytime there is a thread switch
**	whether or not a thread should be moved from the timeout queue to the
**	run queue.  This check requires determining the "current time" and 
**	comparing it with the "time" the thread was suspended - these "times"
**	can be relative rather than absolute as only the difference is used.
**	
**	A straight forward implementation could query TMget_stamp() for every
**	suspend and thread switch and determine timeouts that way.  The cost
**	of such an implementation would be a system call for every suspend for
**	timeout and thread switch while a suspend was active.  For comparison
**	a TPC/B transaction thread switches approximately 3 times for every
**	transaction (one read from client, one read from account, and one wait
**	for LG force).  This would mean 3 extra system calls per transaction.
**
**	In 6.4 a single process (the RCP) updated the shared memory "clock"
**	while all other processes read from the shared memory address to 
**	determine the clock's value.  It turned out that the main user of the
**	clock was the RCP which was in charge of group commit.  It did this
**	by updating the clock after waking up from a subsecond "timeout" based
**	on select or poll.
**
**	In 6.5 the RCP no longer is responsible for clock update or group
**	commit.  Mainline group commit threads request timeout service from
**	the CL, and manage group commit.  Before implementation of 
**	CS_update_smclock() the
**	only updater of the shared memory clock was code executed upon return
**	from a server level idle (ie. when the server has nothing to do it
**	calls iiCLpoll() with a timeout equal to minimum timeout on the 
**	timeout queue if the queue is non-empty, or 90 seconds.  This presented
**	a problem if server never went idle (the clock never advanced or
**	advanced very slowly), and thus group commit didn't work properly.
**
**	In order to fix this problem this module implements a shared memory
**	clock, which is only updated as frequently as necessary.  The design
**	attempts to achieve:
**	    o Minimum number of system calls to query the current time, on
**	      some machines the system call to get time can be expensive.
**	      This will adjust as necessary to system usage.  An idle ingres
**	      installation should not use many resources.
**	    o Allow tuning on different architectures.  TM is not used as
**	      it is possible to implement this module with an absolute 
**	      timestamp (only relative times are necessary).  On some machines
**	      a hardward register may be available which can be used as a
**	      relative timestamp counter.
**	    o An efficient implementation as this code is used by the lowest
**	      level of the context switching system.  If profiling warrants
**	      MACRO inlining may be used.
**
**  History:
**      25-apr-94 (mikem)
**	    Created.
**	26-apr-94 (vijay)
**	    Include fdset.h before csev.h. needs defn of fd_set structure.
**	24-oct-1994 (canor01)
**		B64168: CS_clockinit() was referencing undefined clock_current
**		if xCL_005_GETTIMEOFDAY_EXISTS was not defined.
**      29-Nov-94 (nive)
**              For dg8_us5, chnaged the prototype definition for
**              gettimeofday to gettimeofday ( struct timeval *, struct
**              timezone * )
**	23-May-95 (walro03)
**		Reversed previous change (29-Nov-94).  A better way is to use
**		the correct prototype based on xCL_GETTIMEOFDAY_TIMEONLY vs.
**		xCL_GETTIMEOFDAY_TIME_AND_TZ.
**      15-jun-95 (popri01)
**          Add support for additional, variable parm list, GETTIME prototype
**	25-jul-95 (allmi01)
**		Added support for dgi_us5 (DG-UX on Intel based platforms) following dg8_us5.
**	20-feb-97 (muhpa01)
**		Removed local declaration for gettimeofday() for hp8_us5 to fix
**		"Inconsistent parameter list declaration" error.
**      26-mar-1997 (kosma01)
**          Added xCL_GETTIMEOFDAY_TIME_AND_VOIDPTR for rs4_us5
**          to agree with arguments of gettimeofday() in <sys/time.h>.
**      07-Jul-1998 (kinpa04)
**		Quantum count was getting out of sync and timeouts occurred
**		too soon since the out_of_date value was being ignored 
**		when it was negitive. Bug#90930.
**	16-Nov-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Changed to return the number of ms instead of VOID, added
**	    code for OS threads to return real thread time instead of
**	    quantum time for the server, which is neither accurate nor
**	    thread safe.
**	15-Mar-1999 (popri01)
**	    Unixware (usl_us5) does not have a high-resolution timing
**	    function, so use TMhrnow which should at least be thread-safe.
**	26-mar-1999 (muhpa01)
**	    Add hpb_us5 for calling TMhrnow().
**      05-Apr-1999 (kosma01)
**              Used existing xCL_GETTIMEOFDAY_TIMEONLY_V for sgi_us5.
**              This allows local prototype of gettimeofday to agree with
**              gettimeofday() prototype in <sys/time.h>.
**	09-Apr-1999 (schte01)
**       Added axp_osf to list of TMhrnow users.
**	27-Apr-1999 (ahaal01)
**	    Added rs4_us5 to ifdef for TMhrnow.
**      01-Aug-1999 (linke01)
**         calling TMhrnow(), adopt popri01's change.
**      14-Feb-2000 (linke01)
**          undefined gettimeofday for usl_us5
**	24-May-2000 (toumi01)
**		Added int_lnx to list of TMhrnow users.
**	15-aug-2000 (somsa01)
**	    Added ibm_lnx to list of TMhrnow users.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	26-feb-2001 (devjo01)
**	    Add usage of 'cscl_calls_since_inc' and 'cscl_numcalls_before_inc'
**	    to prevent premature lock time-outs and session wakes on
**	    when using INTERNAL threads, and 'CS_checktime' is called more 
**	    than 1000 times a second. (b104072/INGSRV1389).
**	22-Jun-2009 (kschendel) SIR 122138
**	    Use any_aix, sparc_sol, any_hpux symbols as needed.
**	16-Nov-2010 (kschendel) SIR 124685
**	    Prototype / include fixes.
**	23-Nov-2010 (kschendel)
**	    Drop obsolete ports.
**     13-Jul-2011 (hanal04) SIR 125458
**         Update cs_elog calls inline with sc0e_putAsFcn changes.

**	    as clock_gettime().
**	10-Dec-1999 (podni01)
**	    Force rux_us5 to use TMhrnow().
**      13-Dec-1999 (hweho01)
**          AIX 64-bit (ris_u64) does not have gethrtime(), so need to 
**          call TMhrnow().
**	3-nov-00 (inkdo01)
**	    Removed "mod 10" test before performing ADD_QUANTUM, since 
**	    the test costs as much CPU as the addition and it essentially
**	    slows the time slicing process in Ingres threads installations.
**	8-feb-02 (hayke02)
**	    Exclude rs4_us5 from the new OS threading method of updating the
**	    quantum timer by calls to gettimeofday() via TMhrnow() and TMet().
**	    Instead, use the 'old'/internal threading method of calling
**	    CS_realtime_update_smclock() (which will call gettimeofday())
**	    every 500th call, and use CS_ADD_QUANTUM() for the other 499
**	    calls. This change fixes bug 106893.
**	29-may-02 (hayke02)
**	    Extend the above fix for 106893 to dgi_us5.
**      28-July2003 (hanal04) Bug 110468 INGSRV 2367
**          During idle periods (including a fully stalled installation
**          which is awaiting the resumtption of the Deadlock Detector Thread,
**          the idle thread is the only thread driving us towards an update
**          of the real system time (if we are running internal threads).
**          Incrementing a count 5000 times, at a rate of once per second
**          so that we can avoid the cost of a system call causes sessions
**          suspended on a timeout to wait much longer than anticipated.
**          This change will update the system time if the idle thread
**          finds that no other threads have called this function since the
**          idle thread last called this function.
**      30-Jan-2004 (hanal04) Bug 110468 INGSRV 2367 
**          Client testing of initial change showed continued deadlocks
**          tough less frequent. For Sequent only always refresh the 
**          clock to prevent 5 second timeouts becoming 2 hours timeouts.
