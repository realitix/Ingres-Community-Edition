/**
**
**  Name: CSSEM.C - module containing CS semaphore routines.
**
**  Description:
**	Contains all routines which deal with CS semaphore operations.  
**	Broken out of csinterface.c to give compiler optimizers a chance
**	at this file (csinterface.c is nooptim on some platforms because of 
**	some stack manipulations done be some other routines).
**
**	external functions:
**
**	    CSp_semaphore() - Perform a "P" operation, claiming the semaphore
**	    CSv_semaphore() - Perform a "V" operation, releasing the semaphore
**	    CSi_semaphore() - Initialize Semaphore.
**	    CSa_semaphore() - attach to a CS_SEM_MULTI semaphore
**	    CSr_semaphore() - Remove a semaphore
**	    CSd_semaphore() - detach semaphore.
**	    CSn_semaphore() - give a name to a semaphore
**	    CSw_semaphore() - Initialize and Name a semaphore
**			      (CSi_ + CSn_) in one operation.
**	    CSs_semaphore() - Return semaphore statistics.
**
**	static functions:
**
**	    CS_sem_owner_dead() - determine if process holding semaphore is dead
**
**  History:
**      25-apr-94 (mikem)
**	    Created.  Moved code from csinterface.c.
**  	17-May-94 (daveb) 59127
**  	    Fix stat initialization, add code to debug leaks.
**  	    Semaphores are not attached for IMA stat purposes
**  	    until they are named.  
**	24-May-1994 (fredv)
**	    Removed the extra right ')' that cause compilation error in
**		CSa_semaphore.
**	31-mar-1995 (canor01)
**	    added include of <me.h>
**	11-May-1995 (jenjo02)
**	    Substantially modified spin logic to dispatch another
**	    thread instead of napping. General code cleanup, 
**	    hole plugging (i.e., don't leave inkernel set, ever).
**	    Added CSw_semaphore(), which combines the functionality
**	    of CSi and CSn to initialize AND name a semaphore with
**	    one call.
**	25-May-1995 (jenjo02)
**	    Renamed CSp|v_semaphore function entry point names
**	    to CSp|v_semaphore_function to distinguish them from
**	    macros with the same names. CSp|v_semaphore_function
**	    are defined in cs.h .
**	05-Jun-1995 (jenjo02)
**	    Added support for shared cross-process semaphores.
**	    Altered exclusive->shared collisions to block additional
**	    shares while exclusive request is pending.
**	    Changed MP spin-dispatch to be somewhat "self-tuning".
**	    Instead of always spinning Cs_max_sem_loops-times before
**	    redispatch, compute the average number of historic
**	    spins-before-grant and use that number. That number 
**	    will vary over the life of the server and the specific
**	    semaphore, so it should be more useful than the 
**	    fixed Cs_max_sem_loops number.
**	21-Sep-1995 (jenjo02)
**	    In CSv_semaphore(), spin on shared cross-process
**	    semaphore until atomic set is acquired; other processes
**	    may be updating the semaphore (and holding the latch)
**	    at the same time. Also cleaned up handling of inkernel
**	    in CSv_semaphore().
**	07-Dec-1995(jenjo02)
**	    Defined CSs_semaphore() function which returns selected
**	    statistics for a given semaphore.
**	02-Jul-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Removed #ifdef VMS code. VMS has its own CL.
**	    Also removed references to Cs_srv_block.cs_inkernel
**	    and scb->cs_inkernel which are artifacts from the
**	    days when this code was shared with VMS.
**      09-jan-1997 (canor01)
**          Do not register semaphores with MO; delete calls to
**          CS_sem_attach().
**      18-feb-1997 (hanch04)
**          As part of merging of Ingres-threaded and OS-threaded servers,
**	    check Cs_srv_block.cs_mt
**	08-jul-1997 (canor01)
**	    Maintain semaphores on known semaphore list.
**	07-aug-1997 (canor01)
**	    Temporarily disable the known semaphore list.
**	19-aug-1997 (canor01)
**	    Make known semaphore list dependent on xCL_NEED_SEM_CLEANUP.
**  21-Aug-1997 (devjo01)
**	    Modify CSp_semaphore_function to detect deadlocks caused
**	    by CPU startvation. (*5631925).
**	23-sep-1997 (kosma01)
**	    For SIMULATE_PROCESS_SHARED platforms, different functions
**	    clean up MULTI semaphores and SINGLE semaphores.
**  12-Dec-97 (bonro01)
**      Added cleanup code for cross-process semaphores during
**      MEsmdestroy().  This code is currently only required for DGUX
**      so it is enabled by xCL_NEED_SEM_CLEANUP.
**  23-Mar-1999 (hanal04)
**          In CSp_semaphore_function() take local copies of unprotected
**          data values before using those values in division. b95990.
**	21-jan-1999 (canor01)
**	    Remove erglf.h.
**	13-oct-1999 (somsa01)
**	    In CSp_semaphore_function(), moved first breakout check for
**	    Cs_incomp to the point where we are blocked, as that is the
**	    point where we should die if we're in completion. It was
**	    causing the "P" operation in sc0m_deallocate() to fail,
**	    leading to a memory leak.
**  03-Jul-1999 (devjo01)
**	    Modify CSp_semaphore_function to temporarily reduce session
**	    priority for long term spinners on a cross process mutex.
**	    Ingres cannot detect session scheduling/mutex deadlocks
**          that span multiple servers.  This hueristic assumes such a
**          deadlock exists if we reach the point where the old logic 
**          would sleep the process. (b95607/INGSRV0736).
**	15-Nov-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Removed cs_sem_init_pid, cs_sem_init_addr, both of which were
**	    of dubious value and just wasting space.
**  08-Dec-1999 (hanal04) Bug 95607 INGSRV 736
**          Slight modification to the above change. During a mutex
**          deadlock the DBMS logs grow continually with 'reducing priority'
**          messages until the disk is full. Also report the address of the
**          semaphore that the session is spinning on.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	04-Oct-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Renamed all external CS?_semaphore functions
**	    to IICS?_semaphore, deleted all cs_mt tests.
**  11-Jan-2002 (hanal04) Bug 106804 INGSRV 1655.
**          Improve the time in which session priority mutex deadlock 
**          is avoided in CSp_semaphore().
**	21-Jan-2007 (kiria01) b117581
**	    Use global cs_state_names instead of explicit strings
**	11-Nov-2010 (kschendel) SIR 124685
**	    Prototype / include fixes.
**	29-Nov-2010 (frima01) SIR 124685
**	    Added include of qu.h with QUr_* prototypes.
**      13-Jul-2011 (hanal04) SIR 125458
**          Update cs_elog calls inline with sc0e_putAsFcn changes.

/*{
** Name: CSp_semaphore()	- perform a "P" operation on a semaphore
**
** Description:
**	This routine is called to allow a thread to request a semaphore
**	and if it is not available, to queue up for the semaphore.  The
**	thread requesting the semaphore will be returned to the ready
**	queue when the semaphore is V'd.
**
**	At the time that the semaphore is granted, the fact that a semaphore
**	is held by the thread is noted in the thread control block, to prevent
**	the stopping of the thread (via the monitor) while a semaphore is held.
**
**	Shared semaphores refer to an extension of the semaphore concept to
**	include a more general software lock.  This mechanism is used to
**	facilitate a more efficient reference count mechanism.
**
**	If the requested semaphore has a type CS_SEM_MULTI then that semaphore
**	may be located in shared memory and the granting/blocking on this
**	semaphore must work between multiple processes.  CS_SEM_MULTI semaphores
**	are expected to model spin locks and should only be held for short
**	periods of time.  Clients should never do operations which may cause
**	their threads to be suspended while holding a CS_SEM_MULTI semaphore.
**
**	All semaphores should be initialized with a CSi_semaphore call before
**	being used by CSp_semaphore().
**
** Inputs:
**	exclusive			Boolean value representing whether this
**					request is for an exclusive semaphore
**	sem				A pointer to a CS_SEMAPHORE for which
**					the thread wishes to wait.
**
** Outputs:
**	none
**	Returns:
**	    OK				- semaphore granted.
**	    E_CS000F_REQUEST_ABORTED	- request interrupted.
**	    E_CS0017_SMPR_DEADLOCK	- semaphore already held by requestor.
**          E_CS0029_SEM_OWNER_DEAD     - owner process of semaphore has exited.
**
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	    none
**
** History:
**	05-Nov-1986 (fred)
**	    Created.
**	14-jan-1987 (fred)
**	    Added shared/exclusive boolean.
**	11-Nov-1987 (fred)
**	    Add support for semphore collision collection & reporting.
**	01-oct-88 (eric)
**	    Added checks for ASTs that are disabled or in progress.
**	 7-nov-88 (rogerk)
**	    Call CS_ssprsm directly instead of through AST's.
**	    Added new inkernel protection.  Set cs_inkernel flag in both
**	    the server block and scb to make the routine behave as if atomic.
**	    When done, turn off the inkernel flags and check to see if we
**	    CS_move_async is needed.
**	12-jun-89 (rogerk)
**	    Added cross-process semaphore support.  Loop until lock is granted.
**	31-Oct-89 (anton)
**	    Added quantum support
**	23-mar-1990 (mikem)
**	    Changes to increase xact throughput for multiprocessors.  LG/LK
**	    cross process semaphores are now built on top of the cross process
**	    code for regular CS{p,v}_semaphores.  Fixes to this file were
**	    necessary to make these semaphores work correctly when called from
**	    the dmfrcp, rather than the server.
**
**	    - Changed the code to refer to "Cs_srv_block.cs_pid" rather than
**	      to "scb->cs_pid" when it wanted the current process' pid.  The
**	      old method did not work for some situations in non-dbms processes.
**	    - Some code refered to the "scb" control block to keep track of
**	      performance stats.  This code was changed to not be called in
**	      the cases where the "scb" did not exist (was NULL).
**	    - Changed code to handle special case of Cs_incomp and multiprocess
**	      semaphores.  If this case happens we spin until we get the
**	      resource as switching will result in recursive scheduling.
**	02-apr-1990 (mikem)
**	    If the state is CS_INITIALIZING then this is being called
**	    from a non-dbms server (ie. the rcp, acp, createdb, ...).
**	    We never want to call CSsuspend() from CSp_semaphore in this case,
**	    so the code will spin on the semaphore instead.
**	31-may-90 (blaise)
**	    Integrated changes from termcl:
**		Changes to make CSp_semaphore return an error if a multiprocess
**		semaphore is held by a process which has exited (and so will
**		never be granted). Add new routine CS_sem_owner_dead(), and
**		call it to check whether the process owner still exists
**		(after spinning for some amount of time).
**	14-dec-90 (mikem)
**	    Do not spin on cross process semaphores when running on a single
**	    processor machine.  Call II_nap() instead.
**	30-may-1991 (bryanp)
**	    B37501: Call II_nap, rather than CSsuspend, if CSp_semaphore() spins
**	    too long on a CS_SEM_MULTI-type semaphore. CSp_semaphore is at times
**	    called from places where a CSresume may be pending or about to
**	    occur; we cannot safely CSsuspend in order to block the thread for
**	    a second because the CSsuspend call may "eat" the pending CSresume
**	    and the CSresume would be lost, leading to a "hung" thread.
**	25-sep-1991 (mikem) integrated following change: 19-aug-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Changed spin lock in cross process semaphore code to try to
**	    avoid tying up the memory bus with interlock instructions by
**	    looping on the test/set call.  We now loop just looking for
**	    when the semaphore becomes free.  Only when we see it is free
**	    do we try to grab it with a test/set call.  This "snooping"
**	06-apr-1992 (mikem)
**	    SIR #43445
**	    Changed the looping properties of CSp_semaphore() when operating
**	    on a cross process semaphore.  The code now loops Cs_max_sem_loops
**	    (defaults to 200) loops before going into II_yield_cpu_time_slice().
**	17-jul-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Once we start yielding our time slice, check periodically to see if
**	    the semaphore owner has died.
**	23-Oct-1992 (daveb)
**	    prototyped
**	20-sep-93 (mikem)
**	    Bug #66616
**	    Added support for new, per semaphore, semaphore contention 
**	    statistics gathering to CSp_semaphore().  Also added a few
**	    new statistics fields to the server level, semaphore contention
**	    statistics.
**	06-oct-1993 (tad)
**	    Bug #56449
**	    Changed %x to %p for pointers.
**      17-May-1994 (daveb) 59127
**  	    Add ifdef-ed out leak-diagnostic call
**	11-May-1995 (jenjo02)
**	    Changed multi-process waits to CS_swuser() after spin
**	    count is exhausted rather than napping the entire 
**	    server, in the hope that there's some useful work to be
**	    done while we "wait" for the semaphore to become free.
**
**	    Also invented CSp|v_semaphore macros to front-end function 
**	    calls; the only time the functions contained in here
**	    will get invoked will be when the macro detects a collision
**	    or anomalous condition, all in an effort to decrease the
**	    cost of acquiring and freeing a semaphore which, in all
**	    but blocked conditions, should be virtually free.
**	25-May-1995 (jenjo02)
**	    Changed function name to CSp_semaphore_function. Macro is
**	    also named CSp_semaphore for invisibility's sake;
**	    it calls CSp_semaphore_function().
**	05-Jun-1995 (jenjo02)
**	    Added support for shared cross-process semaphores.
**	
**	    Altered exclusive->shared collisions to block additional
**	    shares while exclusive request is pending.
**	 
**	    Changed MP spin-dispatch to be somewhat "self-tuning".
**	    Instead of always spinning Cs_max_sem_loops-times before
**	    redispatch, compute the average number of historic
**	    spins-before-grant and use that number. That number 
**	    will vary over the life of the server and the specific
**	    semaphore, so it should be more useful than the 
**	    fixed Cs_max_sem_loops number.
**  16-oct-1996 (merja01)
**      Moved ifdef VMS to col 1 so it would compile on OSF.
**  21-Aug-1997 (devjo01)
**	    Modify CSp_semaphore_function to better detect deadlocks caused
**	    by CPU startvation. (*5631925).
**  23-Mar-1999 (hanal04)
**      Cross process semaphore statistics are updated when the semaphore is
**      blocked and are not therefore protected from cross process updaters.
**      Take local copies when trying to prevent divide by zero errors. b95990
**	13-oct-1999 (somsa01)
**	    Moved first breakout check for Cs_incomp to the point where we
**	    are blocked, as that is the point where we should die if we're
**	    in completion. It was causing the "P" operation in
**	    sc0m_deallocate() to fail, leading to a memory leak.
**  03-Jul-1999 (devjo01)
**          Modify CSp_semaphore_function to temporarily reduce session
**          priority for long term spinners on a cross process mutex.
**          Ingres cannot detect session scheduling/mutex deadlocks
**          that span multiple servers.  This hueristic assumes such a
**          deadlock exists if we reach the point where the old logic 
**          would sleep the process. (b95607/INGSRV0736).
**  08-Dec-1999 (hanal04) Bug 95607 INGSRV 736
**          Slight modification to the above change. During a mutex
**          deadlock the DBMS logs grow continually with 'reducing priority'
**          messages until the disk is full. Also report the address of the
**          semaphore that the session is spinning on.
**  27-Mar-2001 (devjo01)
**	    Remove VMS conditionals around 'inkernel' sets, since
**	    this may be needed when CSresume is called in a completion
**	    handler.
**  11-Jan-2002 (hanal04) Bug 106804 INGSRV 1655.
**          Further adjustment to the mutex priority deadlock avoidance
**          code. To reduce the contention window the session priority
**          in now halved instead of decremented.

/*{
** Name: CSv_semaphore	- Perform a "V" operation, releasing the semaphore
**
** Description:
**	This routine is used by a running thread to release a semaphore which
**	it currently owns.  The act of doing this decrements the thread's
**	owned semaphore count.	It will allow the threads awaiting this
**	semaphore to try once again.
**
**	If the semaphore type is CS_SEM_MULTI then it is a cross process
**	semaphore.  The semaphore may be kept in shared memory and there may
**	be threads in other servers waiting on its release.
**
** Inputs:
**	sem				A pointer to the semaphore in question.
**
** Outputs:
**	none
**	Returns:
**	    OK
**	    E_CS000A_NO_SEMAPHORE if the task does not own a semaphore.
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	    none
**
** History:
**	05-Nov-1986 (fred)
**	    Created on Jupiter.
**	31-oct-1988 (rogerk)
**	    Make sure we don't exit without resetting cs_inkernel.
**	 7-nov-1988 (rogerk)
**	    Added new inkernel protection.  Set cs_inkernel flag in both
**	    the server block and scb to make the routine behave as if atomic.
**	    When done, turn off the inkernel flags and check to see if we
**	    CS_move_async is needed.
**	12-jun-89 (rogerk)
**	    Added cross-process semaphore support.
**	30-Jan-90 (anton)
**	    Fix idle job CPU spin in semaphore cases
**	23-mar-1990 (mikem)
**	    Changes to increase xact throughput for multiprocessors.  LG/LK
**	    cross process semaphores are now built on top of the cross process
**	    code for regular CS{p,v}_semaphores.  Fixes to this file were
**	    necessary to make these semaphores work correctly when called from
**	    the dmfrcp, rather than the server.
**
**	    - Changed the code to refer to "Cs_srv_block.cs_pid" rather than
**	      to "scb->cs_pid" when it wanted the current process' pid.  The
**	      old method did not work for some situations in non-dbms processes.
**	    - Some code refered to the "scb" control block to keep track of
**	      performance stats.  This code was changed to not be called in
**	      the cases where the "scb" did not exist (was NULL).
**	9-jul-92 (daveb)
**	    Add deferred attach of CS_MULTI semaphores.
**	23-Oct-1992 (daveb)
**	    prototyped
**      17-May-1994 (daveb) 59127
**  	    Add ifdef-ed out leak-diagnostic call
**	25-May-1995 (jenjo02)
**	    Changed function name to CSv_semaphore_function. Macro is
**	    also named CSv_semaphore for invisibility's sake;
**	    it calls CSv_semaphore_function().
**	05-Jun-1995 (jenjo02)
**	    Added support for shared cross-process semaphores.
**	21-Sep-1995 (jenjo02)
**	    In CSv_semaphore(), spin on shared cross-process
**	    semaphore until atomic set is acquired; other processes
**	    may be updating the semaphore (and holding the latch)
**	    at the same time. Also cleaned up handling of inkernel
**	    in CSv_semaphore().
