**  Name: CSSPINTEST.C - A simple test of CS locking and shared memory
**
**  Description:
** 	This program tests the CS locking routines CS_getspin, CS_tas
**	plus MEget_pages, MEget_shared and MEsmdelete. 
**
**    usuage:  csspintest [-t ] number_of_locks number_of_children
**      	where -t sets locking call to CS_tas instead of CS_getspin
**
**   Note:  If this program aborts prematurely, make sure you delete
**   outstanding shared memory segments manually.
**
**          main() - locking  test
**
**
**  History:
**	22-Mar-89 (GordonW)
**	    Correct certain bugs.
**      03-mar-89 (markd)
**          First version
**	12-jun-89 (rogerk)
**	    Changed MEget_pages, MEsmdestroy calls to take character string
**	    segment name rather than a LOCATION pointer.  Added allocated_pages
**	    argument to MEget_pages.
**	15-may-90 (kimman)
**	    Adding ds3_ulx specific fix so that csspintest will work.
**		1)  cannot attach to same shmid in same process space more
**			than once
**		2)  slow down while loop to let other processes fork
**	5-june-90 (blaise)
**	    Integrated changes from 61 and ingresug:
**		Set NO_OPTIM for pyr_u42;
**		Add include <clconfig.h> to pick up correct ifdefs in <csev.h>;
**		Clean up release lock to use CS_ACLR or CS_relspin based on
**		use_tas.
**	09-apr-91 (seng)
**	    Add RS/6000 to machines with systems that can't attach to same shmid
**	    in the same process space more than once.
**	3-jul-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Pass new num_users arg to CS_create_sys_segment().
**	15-jul-93 (ed)
**	    adding <gl.h> after <compat.h>
**      26-jul-1993 (mikem)
**          Include systypes.h now that csev.h exports prototypes that include
**          the fd_set structure.
**	17-aug-1993 (tomm)
**		Must include fdset.h since protypes being included reference
**		fdset.
**      30-Nov-94 (nive/walro03)
**              Integrated change from FCS1 port by kevinm
**              Added dg8_us5 to ds3_ulx specific change that slowed down the
**              loop to let other processes to fork.
**      22-jun-95 (allmi01)
**              Added dgi_us5 to dg8_us5 changes above. DG-UX is DG-UX 
**              whether or not it is on a M68k M88k or Intel based box.
**      25-jul-95 (morayf)
**              Added NO_OPTIM for sos_us5 as optimisation causes process to
**              hang.
**      30-jul-1995 (pursch)
**              Add changes made by erickson from 6405.
**              Slow down loop to allow processes to fork for pym_us5.
**              Turn off optimization for pym_us5. With optim turned on,
**              using the/usr/opt/cc3.11/bin/cc (Optional 3.11 C compiler),
**              process hangs.
**	15-nov-1995 (murf)
**		Added NO_OPTIM for sui_us5 as part 5 of cltest relating to
**		csspintest was looping forever. OS is solaris 2.4 and the
**		compiler is 3.0.1
**	18-dec-95 (morayf)
**		Added NO_OPTIM for rmx_us5 as optimisation causes process to
**		hang for version 1.1A of SINIX 5.42 C compiler.
**	20-feb-1996 (toumi01)
**		Add axp_osf to list of platforms that need sleep().
**	24-jun-1997 (hweho01)
**		Add sleep support for Unixware (usl_us5) with sleep() from libc.
**	29-jul-1997 (walro03)
**		Unoptimize for Tandem NonStop (ts2_us5).  csspintest with
**		more than one forked process loops unless this program is
**		not optimized.
**	17-may-1997 (mosjo01)
**		Remove usleep from dgi_us5 processing, it hangs.
**	32-feb-1998 (toumi01)
**		For Linux (lnx_us5) delay the CS_des_installation().
**		This way we keep the sysseg.mem around until after
**		spintest.mem is allocated.  If this is NOT done we get into
**		trouble: spintest.mem ends up using the same inode as
**		sysseg.mem in $II_SYSTEM/ingres/files/memory, which
**		causes ftok to hash the same IPC key.  This leads to an
**		"already exists" error when we try to allocate spintest.mem,
**		because sysseg.mem is still allocated (the destory marks
**		the shared segment as such, but since an shmdt is not done
**		the nattch is still 1, and the segment is still there).
**	24-jun-1998 (muhpa01)
**		Add hp8_us5 to list using usleep().
**	25-jun-1998 (walro03)
**		After fixes applied on rs4_us5 (AIX 4.1), no need to run shmdt
**		any more.
**      09-aug-1998 (hweho01)
**              Changed to use sleep() for dg8_us5; the process
**              hangs if usleep() is used on DG/88K OS/R.4.11MU04.
**	10-may-1999 (walro03)
**		Remove obsolete version string pyr_u42.
**      03-jul-99 (podni01)
**              Added support for ReliantUNIX V 5.44 - rux_us5 (same as rmx_us5)
**      7-Sep-1999 (bonro01)
**          Modified result variable in spin_on_lock() routine to be VOLATILE
**          to eliminate infinite loop caused by optimization errors.
**          I found that a while() loop without a statement to execute will
**          cause the optimizer to load the test condition variable into a
**          register from memory before the loop, then the test in the loop
**          will only compare the register value and not the value in memory.
**          This kind of optimization is fine for a single-process
**          single-threaded program, but not for a shared memory multi-process
**          application.  Using VOLATILE on the shared memory structure will
**          tell the optimizer that this storage may be modified from outside
**          of the current process.
**          This should correctly fix all the other platforms that had looping
**          problems by letting the compiler know that it needs to refresh the
**          CPU registers with the memory value each time through the while
**          loop.  I've removed NO_OPTIM and sleep() calls for other platforms.
**          Some platforms used NO_OPTIM to get around this problem, and some
**          used sleep() within the while() loop to get around this problem.
**          The sleep fixed the problem because a function call within the loop
**          forced the optimizer to reload the while condition variables from
**          memory.
**	06-oct-1999 (toumi01)
**		Change Linux config string from lnx_us5 to int_lnx.
**      08-Sep-2000 (linke01)
**              Added NO_OPTIM for dgi_us5 as part 5 of cltest relating to
**              csspintest was looping forever.
**       8-dec-1999(mosjo01 SIR 97550)
**         Need NO_OPTIM for sqs_ptx to perform better but not 100%.
**      19-May-2000 (hweho01)
**         Added support for AIX 64-bit platform (ris_u64).
**	19-May-2000 (ahaal01)
**	    Added NO_OPTIM for rs4_us5 to prevent csspintest from hanging.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	14-jun-2000 (hanje04)
**	   Delay the CS_des_installation() For Linux for OS/390 (ibm_lnx) as
**	   for int_lnx. See 32-feb-1999(?) toumi01 change for details 
**	07-Sep-2000 (hanje04)
**	    Added axp_lnx (Alpha Linux) to int_lnx delay of 
**	    CS_des_installation
**	01-Dec-2000 (bonro01)
**	    This fixes a bug that has been in csspintest a long time.
**	    Code in spin_on_lock() was calling CS_SPININIT() before
**	    incrementing the result->start field.  This had the result
**	    of allowing two processes to grab the same lock because the
**	    process did not lock the shared memory when it updated the
**	    the result->start process count.  Changing the CS_SPININIT() to
**	    a CS_TAS locked the shared memory for access and fixed the bug.
**	    On a fast multiprocessing system, the last child process would
**	    increment the process count and allow the other children to 
**	    continue executing and grab the lock.  The last child would
**	    then execute the CS_ACLR() instruction and reset the
**	    lock bit when another child had it locked.
**	    Also discovered that NO_OPTIMization is still required for AIX.
**	    With optimization on, csspintest hangs.  I examined the assembly
**	    code and determined that csspintest was hung on a single
**	    assembly instruction that kept testing a register value
**	    and looping on the same instruction until the register changed.
**	    This was the code generated for the statement
**	    while(result->start != num_child);  in spin_on_lock()
**	    The optimizer did not correctly interpret the VOLATILE type
**	    on the result variable and the code was generated wrong,
**	    so NO_OPTIM is required for AIX.
**	25-jul-2001 (toumi01)
**	    NO_OPTIM i64_aix else csspintest fails
**	03-Dec-2001 (hanje04)
**	    Added IA64 Linux to list of other Linuxes delaying 
**	    CS_des_installation.
**	07-oct-2004 (thaju02)
**	    Change alloc_pages to SIZE_TYPE.
**	12-Jan-2004 (hanje04)
**	    Add support for AMD64 Linux
**       6-Nov-2006 (hanal04) SIR 117044
**          Add int.rpl for Intel Rpath Linux build.
**      23-Mar-2007
**          SIR 117985
**          Add support for 64bit PowerPC Linux (ppc_lnx) by
**	    replacing all *_lnx references with LNX.
**     16-Feb-2010 (hanje04)
**         SIR 123296
**         Add LSB option, writable files are stored under ADMIN, logs under
**         LOG and read-only under FILES location.
**	15-Nov-2010 (kschendel) SIR 124685
**	    Prototype / include fixes.
**     13-Jul-2011 (hanal04) SIR 125458
**         Update cs_elog calls inline with sc0e_putAsFcn changes.
