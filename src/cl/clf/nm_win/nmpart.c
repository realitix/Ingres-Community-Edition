/*{
** Name:	NMsetpart       Set part name for current program
**
** Description:
**
**   NMsetpart provides the ability to provide the CL, and any routines
**   that use this interface, a way to know what major subsystem is
**   calling it.
** 
**   
**   NMsetpart should be invoked as early during the life of the program
**   as possible, certainly before any routines which call its retrieval
**   counterpart (NMgetpart).
** 
**   NMsetpart is intended to be invoked once during the life of a program,
**   and will take no action (except to return an error) upon a subsequent
**   invocation.
**   
**       . The partname should be eight alphanumeric characters or less in 
**	   length.
**       . Since the part name may be used to construct filenames, it must
**         begin with an alphabetic character.
** 
** Inputs:
**	name	Part name
**
** Outputs:
**	None
**
**	Returns:
**		OK
**		NM_PRTLNG	Part name too long
**		NM_PRTFMT	Illegal part name format
**		NM_PRTNUL	Part name is a null string
**		NM_PRTALRDY	Part name already set
**
**	Exceptions:
**		none
**
** Side Effects:
**	none
**
** History:
**	4/1 (Mike S) Initial version

** Name:	NMgetpart       Get part name for current program
**
** Description:
**   NMgetpart provides the ability to obtain the name of the invoking
**   component/part, if it's been set earlier in the life of the application
**   using NMsetpart.
**   
**   NMgetpart will fill in the passed character buffer with the name
**   of the invoking component/part, or an empty string (EOS) if it
**   has not been set earlier by NMsetpart.
**
**   If the passed buf is NULL, the function will return a pointer to
**   a static internal buffer, which may be overwritten, or NULL if
**   it has not been set earlier by NMsetpart.
**
** Inputs:
**	none
**
** Outputs:
**	buf			the name of the invoking component/part
**
**	Returns:
**		NULL		No part has been successfully set
**		Part name	Part has been set
**
**	Exceptions:
**		none
**
** Side Effects:
**	none
**
** History:
**	4/91 (Mike S)	Initial version
**	9-jun-1995 (canor01)
**	    modified to accept a passed buffer.
