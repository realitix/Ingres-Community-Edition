/******************************************************************************
** Name:	metagutl.c	- Utility routines for tagged memory.
**
** Description:
**	Background:
**	    At the time this was written, the implementation of
**	    tagged memory was inefficient on frees.  MEtfree was implemented
**	    by traversing the allocated list of memory pointed to by
**	    MElist and freeing each node found that match the tag.
**	    Obviously, this could be a very slow traversal.
**
**	    To speed this up, the implementation of tagged memory was
**	    changed, and this files contains routines that help with the
**	    implementation.
**
**	Implementation:
**	    The new implementation of tagged memory uses a hash table to
**	    store chains of the allocated blocks.  Each tag has its own
**          chain of allocated blocks so that freeing a table only
**	    requires finding the chain and then freeing each node on
**	    the chain.
**
**	Defines:
**		IIME_atAddTag	A new block of allocated memory for a tag.
**
**		IIME_ftFreeTag	Free all the memory allocated for a tag.
**
** History:
**	5-dec-1989 (Joe)
**	    First Written
**	08-aug-1995 (canor01)
**	    Add semaphore protection for tag queue
**	21-mar-1996 (canor01)
**	    Free memory from calling process's heap.  Compact the
**	    heap after all the tagged memory has been freed.
**	03-jun-1996 (canor01)
**	    Internally, store the tag as an i4 instead of an i2. This makes
**	    for more efficient code on byte-aligned platforms that do fixups.
**	06-aug-2001 (somsa01)
**	    Use meprivate.h instead of melocal.h .
**	05-jun-2002 (somsa01)
**	    Synched up with UNIX by utilizing MEtaglist_mutex.
**	21-jun-2002 (somsa01)
**	    Removed call to HeapCompact().
**	 5-Aug-2005 (drivi01)
**	    Replaced HeapFree call with free.
** 	23-Sep-2009 (wonst02) SIR 121201
** 	    Initialize freelist pointer, rather than relying on link to do it.
**      13-Jul-2011 (hanal04) SIR 125458
**          Update cs_elog calls inline with sc0e_putAsFcn changes.

** Name:	METAGNODE	- The elements of the hash table chains.
**
** Description:
**	Each bucket of the tagged memory hash table contains a linked
**	list of the chains of allocated memory for the tags that hash
**	to the bucket.  This structure implements the node of the linked
**	list.
**
**	met_list is the head of the chain of allocated blocks.  This is
**	a QUEUE, and is used exactly like the MElist variable, which
**	holds the blocks of memory allocated under tag 0.  As with MElist
**	the blocks contained in this QUEUE are ME_NODEs.
**	An important point here is that since the allocated blocks are
**	on a QUEUE just like MElist, MEfree works correctly when freeing
**	a block of tagged memory.  This does mean that a METAGNODE can
**	contain an empty queue.
**
**	met_tag is the tag for which this node contains the chain of
**	allocated blocks.
**
**	met_hash is the pointer to the next METAGNODE in the hash chain
**	of which this node is a part.

** Description:
**	This routine is called when a new block of dynamic memory is being

**	of this routine is to store the allocated memory so that it
**	will be freed with the other blocks allocated under this tag when
**	MEtfree is called.
**
**	It works by checking the hash table for an METAGNODE for this tag.
**	If none is found, a new METAGNODE is allocated for this tag.
**	Then the block of memory is put on the QUEUE for the METAGNODE.
**
** Inputs:
**	tag		The tag under which this block of memory is

**	node		The block of memory being allocated.
**
** Side Effects:
**	This will take a node off freelist, and if necessary will allocate
