**
**  Name: GCACLW95.C - IPC implementation for GCA and GCN private CL routines
**
**  Description:
**      The routines in this file are CL since the internals will vary
**      across O.S. environments.
**
**      They implement local IPC between GCA users (clients and servers).
**
**      The routines are PRIVATE to GCA and GCN.
**      They must never be called by other
**      facilities.  
**
**	These routines are designed to abstract gcacl from the 
**	specific IPC mechanism being used. Previously the IPC was all done
**	in GCACL; however, the need to have the same code run under both 
**	Windows 95 and Windows NT required that the actual mechanism be
** 	hidden from the gcacl. The result is that the routines in the 
**	gcacl don't care whether they are using named pipes, anonymous 
**	pipes, memory mapped files etc. They simply call routines in this
**	module which take care of the actual interprocess communications.
**	This avoids unecessary complication in gcacl.
**
**	The original implementation in gcacl.c used named pipes; however,
**	Windows 95 does not permit the creation of named pipes so this 
**	implementation employs anonymous pipes. Using anon pipes complicates
**	the situaltion substantially enough to justify creating a new file. The
**	functions in this file could be very easily modified to use named pipes
**	or any other IPC mechnism without having to alter gcacl.c
**
** History:
**	31-jul-95 (mls)
**		Created.
**	01-aug-95 (leighb)
**		Removed "Broken Pipe" SIprintf message.
**      01-aug-95 (mls)
**		Fixed connection counting.
**	02-aug-95 (mls)
**	    IIReadFile makes sure that asipc, and asipc->IpcInternal are valid
**	    before checking for broken pipes.
**	16-oct-95 (mls)
**	    Added code to make sure that gcc waits for client to close 
**	    connection first. Bug 71896.
**      06-Feb-96 (fanra01)
**              Changed Pipe_buffer_size from extern to GLOBALREF.
** 	06-Feb-96 (wonst02)
** 		Changed CreateAsc to create hMapping as inherited and to save 
**	    asipc->IpcInternal.hMapping for IPCsave and IPCrestore.
**      27-may-97 (mcgem01)
**          Cleaned up compiler warnings.
**	14-oct-1997 (canor01)
**	    Before closing all pipes in a connection, write a zero-length 
**	    message on receive pipes to wake up any pending receives in 
**	    helper threads.
**	06-apr-1998 (canor01)
**	    In OpenAsc(): Clean up handles on failure.  If shared memory 
**	    still exists, make sure the owning process is still alive.
**      10-Dec-98 (lunbr01) Bug 94183
**          Use PeekNamedPipe rather than shared memory counter (*ct) to check
**          if data is avail to read (for RECEIVES with a non-INFINITE
**          timeout parm only). The shared memory counter was occasionally
**          getting corrupted because IIReadFile and IIWriteFile would update
**          it at the same time; InterlockedExchange was not sufficient...
**          a mutex was needed before the current value of *ct is "gotten"
**          for the increment/decrement.  The result was that IIReadFile
**          would "think" that there was something to read but there wasn't;
**          he would then issue the blocked read and wait forever or until
**          a dbevent happened to come in. The symptom was an application hang.
**          Rather than adding mutexes, PeekNamedPipe was used and the 
**          shared memory counters eliminated.
**	08-feb-1999 (somsa01 for lunbr01)
**	    Save off the read ends of the SndStdChan pipes as we'll need
**	    to peek on this to ensure that the purge message doesn't
**	    get mangled. Duplicate the read end of the pipe right after
**	    the pipe is created because it will get closed after a front
**	    end client get ahold of it (DuplicateHandle) from the
**	    shared memory. Close the handle when we disassociate.
**	    These changes were taken from OI Desktop changes in March 97
**	    by mcgem01 and zhayu01.
**      06-aug-1999 (mcgem01)
**          Replace nat and longnat with i4.
**	08-feb-2001 (somsa01)
**	    Use INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE rather than 0xFFFFFFFF when calling
**	    CreateFileMapping().
**  13-aug-2009 (zhayu01) SIR 121210
**      Adopted it for Pocket PC 2003/Windows CE.
**      mClient does not use Ingres net and the adoption is
**      to make it compiled.
**	13-Apr-2010 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122679
**	    Include of gcccl.h added since now needed by gclocal.h.

** CreateAsc( ) --- Create an association.
**
** Inputs:
**	asipc	ASSOC_IPC for association
**	name	name of server creating association.
** Output:
**	returns TRUE if succeeds.
**
** GClisten( ) calls CreateAsc( ) when a server wishes to create
** a new association. CrateAsc( ) allocates the resources required by 
** the association, and exposes shared information available to other processes.
** The only requirements are that it create four handles in the ASSOC_IPC:
** standard send, standard receive, expedited send, and expeditied receive.
** These handles are the only members created here used by gcacl. In 
** this implementation handles to anonymous pipes are used.
**
** If there are no existing connections to the server spicified in the 
** name parameter, CreateAsc( ) creates the server specific resources and
** adds the server to the internally maintained list of servers. A memory mapped
** mapped file is created for passing information between the client and 
** server. This file contains a temporary area for passing process id and
** handles which the client needs to copy to its own ASSOC_IPC. It also 
** contains and array of assoc_info structures. These structures contain
** information that must be shared per connection for the duration of each 
** association. A mutex is created to protect access to the temporary area.
** The temporary area is only used when a connectionis first established
** to copy handles to the pipes and other information to the requester's
** ASSOC_IPC.
**
** Two events are also created to arbitrate the connection process. When
** a server is ready for a connection, it signals a "listening event". 
** and waits for a client to set a requesting event. Before connecting 
** a client waits on the listening event before trying to connect. When
** the client tries to connect it sets a requesting event to tell the server
** that a client has connected.
**
** The names for the memory mapped file, the mutex, and the events are
** based on the server name.
**
** History:
**      10-Dec-98 (lunbr01) Bug 94183
**          Eliminate use of *Ct fields (using PeekNamedPipe instead).

** IIReadfile and IIWritefile must maintain a count of how many bytes are in
** the channel in order to implement the timeout functionality because anonymous
** pipes don't provide a wait function like named pipes. Database events 
** require the timeout functionality.

** History:
**      04-Sep-97 (fanra01)
**          Add return of OS error if read 0 bytes.
**      10-Dec-98 (lunbr01) Bug 94183
**          Use PeekNamedPipe rather than shared memory counter (*ct) to check
**          if data is avail to read (for RECEIVES with a non-INFINITE
**          timeout parm only). The shared memory counter was occasionally
**          getting corrupted because IIReadFile and IIWriteFile would update
**          it at the same time; InterlockedExchange was not sufficient...
**          a mutex was needed before the current value of *ct is "gotten"
**          for the increment/decrement.  The result was that IIReadFile
**          would "think" that there was something to read but there wasn't;
**          he would then issue the blocked read and wait forever or until
**          a dbevent happened to come in. The symptom was an application hang.
**          Rather than adding mutexes, PeekNamedPipe was used and the 
**          shared memory counters eliminated.
