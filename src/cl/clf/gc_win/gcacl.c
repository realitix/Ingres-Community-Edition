/******************************************************************************
**
**  Name: GCACL.C - GCA and GCN private CL routines
**
**  Description:
**
**  The routines in this file are CL since the internals will vary
**  across O.S. environments.
**
**  They provide local IPC between GCA users (clients and servers).
**
**  The routines are PRIVATE to GCA and GCN.
**  They must never be called by other
**  facilities.  Some routines make indirect use of portions of GCA
**  mainline code.
**
**  The following routines are contained in this module:
**
**      GCinitiate- perform CL level initialization
**      GCrequest - Build connection to peer entity
**      GCregister- Establish server identity and prepare for "listen"
**      GClisten  - Make server available for connection to peer entity
**      GCsend    - Send data over local IPC connection
**      GCreceive - Receive data over local IPC connection
**      GCrelease - Release connection to peer entity
**      GCdisconn - Force completion of outstanding requests
**      GCsave    - Save system-dependent data structures
**      GCrestore - Restore system-dependent data structures
**      GCpurge   - Cancel outstanding requests and send purge mark
**      GCterminate - Perform necessary local termination functions
**      GCdetect  - see if a server is still active
**      GCsync    - wait for completion of asynch event(s)
**      GCusrpwd  - authenticate a userid/password pair (no-op on NT)
**
** History:
**	??-???-?? (?????)
**	   Original.
**	17-jun-95 (emmag)
**	   Rewritten to make use of Async read and writes on the named
**	   pipes.
**	25-jun-95 (emmag)
**	   Fixed bug in GCpurge which causes the session to hang.
**	27-jun-95 (emmag)
**	   Maximum number of pipe instances should be dependent on
**	   the connect_max parameter in config.dat and not hard-coded.
**      12-jul-1995 (wonst02)
**         Add the hSignalShutdown Event
**	13-jul-95 (emmag)
**	   Zero byte messages were sometimes being lost on the pipe.
**	   Replaced the zero byte message with a fixed length message
**	   which, if detected, is treated as a chop-mark.  This was done
**	   in both GCreceive and GCCompletionRoutine.
**	   Implemented a timed read in GCreceive.
**	   Fixed up a compiler warning in the previous submission.
**	   GCerror macro put back in place now that the debugging is
**	   complete!!!!!
**      15-jul-95 (emmag)
**          Use a NULL Discretionary Access Control List (DACL) for
**          security, to give implicit access to everyone.
**	17-jul-95 (emmag)
**	    The timed read in GCreceive was causing the copy in command
**	    to hang the terminal monitor.  Have removed this code for the
**	    first QA release and will address this issue later.
**	17-jul-1995 (shero03)
**	    If the listen is interrupted, disconnect the pipe so that
**	    the closehandle will remove the server's pipe.
**	18-jul-95 (canor01)
**	    semaphore protect memory allocation routines for MCT
**      18-jul-95 (reijo01)
**          Changed SETWIN32ERR so that it will populate the CL_ERR_DESC with
**          the proper values.
**	21-jul-95 (emmag)
**	    Removed redundant GetThreadID call from the completion routine.
**      21-jul-95 (chech02)
**          Added security level.
**	24-jul-95 (emmag)
**	    Remove the hPurgeEvent.
**	    Removed the calls to FlushFileBuffers which were causing
**	    a hang in processing iibreak manifesting itself as a hang
**	    in processing a help command, or in pressing CTRL-C in the
**	    terminal monitor when retrieving data.
**	    Renamed Roger and Steve's event to hSignalShutdown to make
**	    its purpose clearer.
**	    Any other changes missing from this revision of the file
**	    will be revisited in the near future.  They have been
**	    removed because they caused the server/frontends to hang.
**	25-jul-95 (emmag)
**	    The chopmark that we'll receive from UNIX/VMS etc will
**	    not be our "CHOPMARK", but a zero byte read.  This was
**	    copmletely overlooked in the work I did to alter the
**	    purge message.
**      04-Aug-95 (fanra01)
**          Bug #70280 #70304
**          Replaced GC_ASSOC_FAIL with NP_IO_FAIL. This enables the higher
**          levels to handle an abnormal termination of a connection partner
**          and to free resources.
**          Previously would have left a dbms thread in CSsuspend in CS_setup.
**	10-aug-1995 (canor01)
**	    restore the FlushFileBuffers() call to GCdisconn().
**	22-aug-1995 (canor01)
**	    semaphore protect GClisten() initialization routines (MCT)
**	25-aug-1995 (emmag)
**	    GCpurge must use an overlapped structure to do the WriteFile
**	    since the pipe was created with the FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED bit
**	    set.
**      25-aug-1995 (lawst01,chech02)
**          If the association id in the ACB is set to -1 (no active session),
**          don't drive the completion routine.
**	30-aug-95 (emmag)
**	    Change pipe's Read Mode from message to byte.   This is because
**	    we were seeing some messages merging on the pipe in message
**	    mode, causing the system to hang.
**	30-aug-1995 (shero03)
**	    Add Read and Write counts
**	05-sep-95 (emmag)
**	    Rationalise the use of the hCompletion event.
**	06-sep-95 (emmag)
**	    Change read-mode back to message mode, since we still
**	    observe the merged messages regardless of read-mode.
**	    This is generally acknowledged as a problem on NT.
**	    The only case in which this becomes a real problem
**	    is when chop-mark is sent on the pipe.  We rely on
**	    this message not being merged with anything else.
**	    Our workaround for now is to put the CHOPMARK on
**	    the pipe and then do a FlushFileBuffers which will
**	    cause the server to wait until the CHOPMARK is read
**	    by the client and not write anything to the pipe
**	    until this happens.  This means that no other message
**	    *should* merge with the CHOPMARK on the pipe.
**	30-oct-1995 (canor01)
**	    two thread-local storage variables do not need to
**	    use thread-local storage
**	11-nov-95 (chech02)
**	    Added support for windows 95.
**	14-nov-95 (emmag)
**	    Interoperability problems with OpenROAD on the same node
**	    meant changing the architecture to use four simplex pipes
**	    in place of the two duplex pipes we were using.
**	17-nov-95 (canor01)
**	    Cleaned up code.
**	12-dec-1995 (canor01)
**	    While the server is recycling another instance of the
**	    connect pipe, the error returned may be ERROR_PIPE_BUSY
**	    or ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND.  Add a loop to allow the next
**	    instance to be created.
**      12-Dec-95 (fanra01)
**          Added definitions for extracting data for DLLs on windows NT
**	13-dec-1995 (canor01)
**	    FASTSELECT clients expect NO_PEER on a failed GCrecvpeer().
**	21-dec-1995 (canor01)
**	    Restore the hPurgeEvent for NT to synchronize GCpurge()'s
**	    in single-threaded iigcc.
**	28-dec-1995 (emmag)
**	    Increase the wait before retrying on a busy connect pipe.
**	    Decrease the retry count since the two are related..
**	30-dec-1995 (emmag)
**	    Using the hPurgeEvent to synchronize the GCpurge's
**	    means that the call to FlushFileBuffers is no longer
**	    required.    Comms servers on both sides of the connection
**	    and the DBMS server were 'NamedPipeServers' thus causing both
**	    the comms server and the DBMS server to hang waiting for the
**	    pipe to be read.
**	30-dec-1995 (canor01)
**	    Add a SleepEx to the end of GCrequest to give the handshaking
**	    I/O a chance to complete.
**	02-jan-1996 (canor01)
**	    Remove the SleepEx call and change the WriteFileEx() in GCrequest()
**	    to a WriteFile() and wait for its completion.
**	04-jan-1996 (canor01)
**	    Re-add the call to FlushFileBuffers() if we are in server
**	    class "INGRES" or "STAR".
**      05-jan-96 (chech02)
**          Re-add WaitForSingleObject(SyncEvent,..) in GCsync() for windows95.
**	14-jan-96 (tutto01)
**	    Re-add the timed receive code in GCreceive().
**	14-jan-96 (emmag)
**	    Remove Todd's highlights inadvertently left in last submission.
**      23-Jan-96 (fanra01)
**          Modifed calls to CSget_scb to a macro which checks to see if this
**          is a client or server.  The scb is NULL on a client and all
**          subsequent actions to the scb are no-op'ed.
**	02-feb-1996 (canor01)
**	    Add SyncEvent to signal synchronous I/O completion for NT.
**	05-feb-96 (emmag)
**	    Implement username password validation.  This requires
**	    winbase.h and advapi32.lib from the MSDN WIN 32 SDK.
**      06-Feb-96 (fanra01)
**	    Integration of DLL changes.
**	14-Feb-96 (emmag)
**	    Do an async read in GCreceive if the run_sync flag isn't
**	    set.
**	19-feb-96 (emmag)
**	    Another OpenROAD compatability problem when running
**	    standalone.   Need to change our CHOPMARK to match
**	    their IIPRGMSG.
**      29-Feb-96 (fanra01)
**          Added GCF_EMBEDDED_GCC section for w95.
**	29-feb-1996 (canor01)
**	    Change pipe's Read Mode from byte to message.   This is because
**	    we were seeing some messages merging on the pipe in byte
**	    mode, causing the system to hang.
**	01-mar-96 (wooke01)
**	    Added in change to password checking for DBCS
**	    ports.  We haven't got a 3.51 Japanese to test with
**	    so need to make port compatable with 3.5 and 3.51.
**	    Made this possible by not using a different API
**	    to validate the password with.
**	14-mar-1996 (canor01)
**	    Max number of connections may be greater than 255, but
**	    max pipe instances is limited to 255.
**	26-mar-1996 (tutto01)
**	    Initialize OVERLAPPED structure.  Without this, bogus information
**	    was being supplied to a ReadFile call, causing it to fail with
**	    "ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER".  This resulted in a listen failure by
**	    the communication server.  
**	27-mar-1996 (emmag)
**	    Introduce a delay in GCpurge for the case where we're
**	    not the named pipe server.   This is an ugly hack that is
**	    required to work around a nasty syncronization bug in STAR, 
**	    and will be removed as a matter of urgency.   This hack allows
**	    QA to continue testing STAR on NT which is a priority right now.
**     01-apr-1996 (canor01)
**	   An invalid connection in GCCompletionRoutine() can be 
**	   manifested through an assoc_id of -1 or by a svc_parms->acb 
**	   that is null.
**	03-apr-1996 (canor01)
**	    GCcreateStandardPipes(): Clean up code. Move MEfree's 
**	    to proper place.
**	04-apr-1996 (canor01)
**	    Events and semaphores created in GCinitiate should not be
**	    inherited by children.
**	22-apr-1996 (canor01)
**	    If GCcreateStandardPipes() fails, free the asipc only once
**	    and set the svc_parms->acb->lcb to null so it won't be
**	    freed again on a GCrelease.
**	26-apr-1996 (emmag)
**	    The default should be for logon failure.   This is something
**	    that will be documented in the release notes.   Also cleaned
**	    up the indentation here to make the doublebyte functionality
**	    more readable.
**	26-apr-1996 (canor01)
**	    IIGCC will call GClisten2 on failure of GCcreateStandardPipes,
**	    so we must change svc_parms->acb->lcb there for null as well.
**	07-may-1996 (canor01)
**	    In case of a broken or disconnected pipe in the callback
**	    routine, allow any other asynchronous callbacks to complete
**	    and post their statuses before returning the broken pipe error.
**	    (This avoids "Invalid state transition" errors in iigcc.)
**	15-may-1996 (canor01)
**	    Move most recent changes in NT code into the *_w95 functions.
**	23-may-1996 (canor01)
**	    Limit hPurgeEvent use to single-threaded apps, such as IIGCC.
**	23-may-1996 (canor01)
**	    ERROR_NO_DATA means the pipe is being closed, so return error.
**	07-jun-1996 (emmag)
**	    Windows '95 is incapable of doing a username/password pair
**	    validation, and in many cases there is no current user.
**	    For now, let's leave it up to the server to do the validation.
**	30-jul-96 (fanra01)
**	    Since Windows '95 uses anonymous pipes, remove the pipe
**	    prefix for OpenROAD compatability.
**	23-sep-1996 (canor01)
**	    Move global data definitions to gcdata.c
**      10-Oct-96 (fanra01)
**          Added mutex protection for receive completion in Windows 95 on
**          a per connection basis.  The nameed mutex is based on the pid and
**          the assoc_id is created during request or listen and is destroyed
**          during release.
**      12-Nov-96 (fanra01)
**          Removed the DiconnectNamedPipe calls from GCdisconn.  Diconnect now
**          only closes the handles as in Windows 95 case.  DisconnectNamedPipe
**          causes all pipe handle instances to be invalid even if they have
**          been passed on to children.
**	21-nov-1996 (canor01)
**	    Flush the buffers on the pipe before sending the purge message
**	    to ensure it doesn't get lost on the end of a previous message.
**	02-dec-96 (mcgem01)
**	    Writing beyond the end of the haReceiveMutex caused an access
**	    violation in the STAR SEP tests.   Increase the size of the
**	    array.  Also removed unneeded define.
**	02-dec-1996 (canor01)
**	    Instead of using the server class as the basis of issuing a
**	    FlushFileBuffers(), since this can cause deadlocks with Star,
**	    determine the direction the connection was opened in via the
**	    gca_aux_data.
**	12-dec-96 (mcgem01)
**	    Add a timeout value to GCsync.
**	09-jan-97 (mcgem01)
**	    Remove the PurgeEvent, which is no longer required on NT.
**	18-jan-97 (mcgem01)
**	    Remove the PurgeEvent in it's entirity.
**	20-jan-97 (mcgem01)
**	    The PurgeEvent and all of it's assoicated delays are
**	    required by OpenIngres Deathtrap.
**	22-jan-97 (mcgem01)
**	    There's no need to flush the channel before purging 
**	    on '95. Flushing the channel twice causes a hang in
**	    the disconnect of the iicopy app on Windows '95.
**	30-Jan-97 (kitch01)
**	    Bug 79293 2 concurrent apps will hang during purging if both set 
**	    hPurgeEvent then both waitfor event. This is because the first app
**	    to wake up after the waitfor will reset both hPurgeEvents. A further
**	    problem was found during test, GCC and the DBMS can get out of sync
**	    during GCA_PURGE. This fix cures both problems on NT only.
**	    Change PurgeEvent to a semaphore and associate this with the pid and
**	    assoc_id. The semaphore is created during request or listen and is 
**	    released during GCpurge. The semaphore is reset during GCcompletion.
**	04-feb-97 (mcgem01)
**	    During the purging on Windows '95, the server side should 
**	    flush the pipe before and after sending the purge message
**	    to ensure that it doesn't get appended or prepended to another
**	    message.
**	05-feb-97 (mcgem01 & fanra01)
**	    OpenIngres Desktop: Can't flush an anonymous pipe on 
**	    Windows '95; it returns an Invalid Handle error.  Replace 
**	    the flush  with a delay to allow the write to complete, 
**	    then write a zero byte message in an attempt to flush the 
**	    channel and then follow that by a delay to allow that write 
**	    a chance to complete.  It's nasty, but the only way around 
**	    the merged message problem on '95.
**	06-feb-97 (mcgem01)
**	    Restore NamedPipeServer logic as the OpenIngres Desktop server, 
**	    when run on NT, doesn't fill out gca_aux_data.
**	19-feb-1997 (canor01)
**	    Cross-integrate OI Desktop changes.
**	    Try to do something logical with NamedPipeServer logic that will
**	    work with both Star and Desktop.  Set the asipc->listen_side
**	    flag based on GCrequest vs. GClisten.  This flag is passed
**	    to children via GCsave/GCrestore.
**	05-mar-1997 (canor01)
**	    Do not execute GCA completion routine on ERROR_BROKEN_PIPE.
**	    This can cause AL FSM errors in GCC.
**	12-mar-1997 (canor01)
**	    Remove definition of xDEBUG left from debugging.
**	14-mar-1997 (canor01)
**	    When processing a broken expedited pipe in GCreceive, do not call
**	    the GCA completion routine.
**      17-Mar-97 (fanra01)
**          Modified GCusrpwd from exclusively searching the local account
**          database to including trusted domain account databases.
**      02-apr-97 (mcgem01)
**          Now that double-byte versions of 3.51 and 4.0 are available,
**          we can use the LogonUser API call for username/password
**          validation.
**	21-apr-1997 (canor01)
**	    If the acb has been freed and the memory released, it will
**	    not be NULL, but an invalid pointer.  Use IsBadReadPtr()
**	    to verify it in GCCompletionRoutine().
**	22-apr-1997 (canor01)
**	    Allow GCinitiate() to be called more than once, return at top
**	    of function.
**	22-apr-1997 (canor01)
**	    If II_DBMS_SERVER has been set to a fully qualified name,
**	    i.e. \\SERVER\II\INGRES\nnn, allow the connection to take
**	    place directly, without nameserver or comserver.
**	12-may-97 (mcgem01)
**	    If the connect limit hasn't been specified in config.dat
**	    set the maximum instance count for the named pipes to 
**	    PIPE_UNLIMITED_INSTANCES.
**      12-May-97 (fanra01)
**          Add the setup of rcv_data_length field on successful read.
**          Uninitialised version causing with=## to hang.
**	14-may-97 (mcgem01)
**	    SyncEvent and GCshutdownEvent are defined in gcdata.c and
**	    should have been ref'ed here.
**      02-jun-1997 (canor01)
**          Try to make sure the disconnect message is delivered before
**          pipes are closed.  Make sure all pipe failures are reported
**          back to GCA.
**      25-Jul-97 (fanra01)
**          Modified the architecture for Windows 95.  The implementation now
**          attempts to mimic asynchronous I/O and uses a Windows NT 4.0 and
**          Windows 95 specific function call QueueUserAPC.  This function is
**          only used here in the Windows 95 case and loads the function at

**          Since the user APC can only be executed when the invoking thread
**          is in an alertable wait the 95 specific code in GCsync was removed.
**
**          Made certain portions of the I/O code common between NT and 95.
**          This made the implementation of the APCs easier.
**      04-Sep-97 (fanra01)
**          Replaced error status reporting to GCA completion.
**          Modified conditionals where return types changed from BOOL to

**	28-aug-1997 (canor01)
**	    Allocate connect_block and iocb on the stack for GCrequest
**	    since they are not explicitly freed.
**	07-oct-97 (mcgem01)
**	    Replace LOGON32_LOGON_BATCH with LOGON32_LOGON_NETWORK which is
**	    available only on VC++ 5.0.  This removes the need to grant all
**	    of those darned user rights we normally insist on.  Also closed
**	    off a handle leak.
**      14-Oct-97 (fanra01)
**          Modified the conditions for when a FlushFileBuffer is called.
**          Should isolate the GC level purge message.
**          Scan start of all messages for purge message.
**	15-nov-97 (mcgem01)
**	    Now that we're building with VC++ 5.0, we too can replace
**	    LOGON32_LOGON_BATCH with LOGON32_LOGON_NETWORK to cut down
**	    on the user rights an Ingres/Net user must be granted.
**	19-feb-98 (mcgem01)
**	    Write a zero byte message on the normal and expedited receive

**	12-Jun-98 (rajus01)
**	    Ray (fanra01) found that iigcn process takes up all the CPU
**	    due to infinite loop execution in GCnew_assoc_id() and that 
**	    assoc_id_counter references beyond the handle arrays of purge and
**	    receive. Resolved the issue.
**	    Added new semaphore GC_associd_sem for accessing global 
**	    assoc_id_counter in multi-threaded environments.( Is adding
**	    new semaphore OK??? )
**	18-jun-1998 (canor01)
**	    Synchronize with jasmine.
**	26-Jul-1998 (rajus01)
**	    Added TIMEOUT check for GClisten() requests on NT only using
**	    Waitable Timers.
**      07-nov-1998 (canor01)
**          GCsync() can now be awakened by an asynchronous BIO that timed out.
**	    Use LoadLibrary to get entry points for functions that do not

**	08-feb-1999 (somsa01 for lunbr01)
**	    Simulate a blocking write on W95 on the GCPURGE message to
**	    maintain message boundary; that is, make sure it is not
**	    concatenated with any other messages.  Otherwise, if concat
**	    with other msg, the GCPURGE msg will not be noticed and a
**	    hang will occur (intermittent)...GCPURGE triggered by
**	    GCA_ATTENTION (interrupt). These changes were taken from
**	    OI Desktop changes in March and June 97 by mcgem01 & zhayu01.
**	09-Feb-1999 (somsa01)
**	    In GCpurge(), if is_comm_svr was set, FlushFileBuffers() was
**	    executed to clear out the client read pipe. in other cases, we
**	    just did a wait. However, according to the Micorosft Visual C++
**	    documentation, FlushFileBuffers() will wait until any remaining
**	    data has been read by the client before flushing the pipe.
**	    Therefore, we can use this in ALL situations.
**	15-mar-1999 (somsa01)
**	    Partial x-integration of fix for Jasmine bug 95556; in
**	    GCCompletionRoutine(), do not test for the purge message if
**	    dwNumberXfer is zero.
**	22-mar-1999 (somsa01)
**	    In GCpurge(), replaced the second remaining PCsleep() with
**	    FlushFileBuffers(). It is executed only if there is data left
**	    on the pipe after sending a PURGE message. Also, in GClisten95(),
**	    removed connect_block, as what should be used is asipc->connect.
**	31-mar-1999 (somsa01)
**	    In GCsync(), properly set up the number of events for Windows 95,
**	    as the TIMEOUT event is not valid on that platform.
**	19-apr-1999 (mcgem01)
**	    Close off a semaphore leak in GCrequest by freeing the purge
**	    semaphore in each exit path.
**	19-apr-1999 (somsa01)
**	    In GCregister(), create the pipes after normal initialization.
**	    This way, when a client tries to connect during a server-side
**	    startup, the client will not get back an error but rather wait
**	    for the initialization of the server to complete.
**	06-may-1999 (somsa01)
**	    In GCcloseAllPipes(), for the Server-ended pipes, we must also
**	    perform a DisconnectNamedPipe() before closing the handle.
**	10-may-1999 (somsa01)
**	    Remove the FlushFileBuffers() calls from last change, as they
**	    were causing hangs during the Replicator handoffqa tests.
**	26-May-1999 (rajus01)
**	    GCC was hanging on loopback connections while running replicator
**	    tests: The problem was due to releasing a wrong semaphore object
**	    that actually belonged to a different association. GCnew_assoc_id()
**	    no longer exists. Creation new association id is moved to 
**	    GCcreateSemaphore(). Renamed assoc_id_counter to sem_id_counter.
**      06-aug-1999 (mcgem01)
**          Replace nat and longnat with i4.
**      09-Sep-1999 (fanra01)
**          Bug 98946
**          Add changes to remove sleeps during pipe creation, connection and
**          dicsonnection to improve performance.  Modified the WaitNamedPipe
**          case for infinite wait which now times out every PIPE_RETRY_SLEEP
**          and reposts.  Retry pipe creation if busy.
**          Free resources during error conditions.
**      01-Oct-1999 (fanra01)
**          Bug 99023

**      01-Oct-1999 (fanra01)
**          Implementation of change by loera01 for Bug 90952.
**          Add asyncIoPending counter to determine if IOs have completed.
**          When the last IO completes the asyncIoComplete event is signalled
**          allowing GCdisconn to continue.  This removes the need to use
**          SleepEx to make the disconnecting thread alertable.
**      03-Dec-1999 (fanra01)
**          Bug 99392
**          Update the disconnect logic to ensure that all I/Os are completed
**          before the pipe handles are closed.  Also modify the I/O
**          completion to check for zero length expedited messages with
**          ERROR_BROKEN_PIPE status to complete error free.

**	28-feb-2000 (somsa01 for lunbr01) Bug 95163 for W95
**	    Prior fix for this bug was made in NT-specific code. Implemented
**	    same change in W95. That is, remove PCsleeps in the GCpurge code,
**	    thus greatly improving performance in this area. Shared code as
**	    much as possible with NT. Faster code requires checking Purge
**	    Semaphore in all processes (not just appls) to prevent occasional

**	28-feb-2000 (somsa01 for lunbr01) Bug 99826 for W95
**	    Occasional hang on W95. GC_PURGE was being received (std chan)
**	    before GCA_ATTENTION (exp chan) in client-side GCC. Removed check
**	    that was preventing GC_PURGE semaphore logic from being executed
**	    in server processes. This hang occurred with and without fix for
**	    bug 95163; fix was made to common NT and W95 code, although bug
**	    only reported on W95.
**	04-may-2000 (somsa01)
**	    In GCrequest(), reworked for loop when attempting to connect to
**	    the named pipe to follow more closely the logic on UNIX. We now
**	    loop for a maximum of the timeout (in PIPE_RETRY_SLEEP chunks) or
**	    PIPE_RETRIES (in the case of an infinite timeout). Also, make
**	    sure that 'svc_parms->gc_cb' is set to NULL if we have to free
**	    up the asipc, so that cleanup routines do not end up freeing
**	    up a piece of memory which has already been freed (thus
**	    causing a SEGV). Also, in GCcreateStandardPipes(), moved
**	    creation of the RcvStdChan to the top to speed up client
**	    connections.
**	11-may-2000 (somsa01)
**	    Removed all statements which freed the asipc/gc_cb. This should
**	    only be freed via GCrelease().
**	12-may-2000 (somsa01)
**	    A constant PMget() on max_assocs in GCcreateStandardPipes()
**	    leaks memory; we now do this once in GCregister() and hold onto
**	    it in a static variable.
**	11-oct-2000 (somsa01)
**	    Deleted cs_bio_done, cs_bio_time, cs_bio_waits, cs_dio_done,
**	    cs_dio_time, cs_dio_waits from Cs_srv_block, cs_dio, cs_bio
**	    from CS_SCB. Kept the MO objects for them and added MO
**	    methods to compute their values.
**	25-oct-2000 (somsa01)
**	    Replaced usage of IDname() (which returns the REAL user id)
**	    with GCusername() (which returns the EFFECTIVE user id).
**	07-nov-2000 (somsa01)
**	    In GCusername(), for Embedded Ingres, the user is always ingres.
**	16-mar-2001 (mcgem01)

**      09-Jul-1999 (loera01) Bug 90952
**	   GCcloseAllPipes often returned without allowing the completion

**      25-jan-2000 (lunbr01) Bug 100129
**          Remove calls to DisconnectNamedPipe() during disconnect. This was

**          Increase MAX_ASSOCS from 100 to 1000 for W9x and eliminate

**	    DAS can hang for minutes if multiple concurrent connects.
**	    DBMS is waiting to receive peer info for session from DAS while
**	    DAS is waiting on 2nd session trying to connect to named pipe
**	    instance, which DBMS won't create until he gets peer info for 1st
**	    session.  DAS's send of peerinfo for 1st session can get queued
**	    behind 2nd session connect.  Fix is to make connection processing
**	    asynchronous, which will also significantly improve performance
**	    for all servers when many connections are being requested. 
**	    Add connection statistics to trace output to assist with problem
**	    and performance diagnosis.
**	    Also move GChostname call to init, not for each connect.  Also,
**	    some misc error handling cleanup such as setting GCTRACE level
**	    to 1 (from 3) for various failures such as create purge semaphore

**	    async pending I/O did not complete immediately.  Also, the
**	    error handling was enhanced in that area of code.
**	06-Aug-2009 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122426
**	    Remove mutexing around calls to GCA service completion routine
**	    as it is no longer necessary, since GCA is thread-safe...removes
**	    GCwaitCompletion + GCrestart.  This should improve peformance.
**	    Check for error/warning conditions after successful reads
**	    and writes to the pipe, per recommendation in Microsoft docs;
**	    not encountering as a problem, but at least trace if occurs.
**	    Remove unused CompletionCritSect and clean up compiler warnings.
**	    DUPLEX on pipes is unnecessary and may utilize extra resources;
**	    change to 1-directional depending on usage (remove unnecessary
**	    options, including FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL).
**	    Convert CreateThread() to _beginthreadex() which is recommended
**	    when using C runtime. This also involves using errno instead of
**	    GetLastError() for failures and _endthreadex() at end of thread.
**      13-aug-2009 (zhayu01) SIR 121210
**          Adopted it for Pocket PC 2003/Windows CE.
**          mClient does not use Ingres net and the adoption is
**          just to make it compiled.
**	21-Aug-2009 (drivi01)
**	    In efforts to port to Visual Studio 2008, clean up warnings.
**	11-Sep-2009 (Bruce Lunsford) Bug 122589 and 122426
**	    After previous fix (for sir 122426), local connections from an
**	    OpenROAD client built on a pre-Ingres 9.3 codebase (eg, OpenROAD
**	    2006 SP1) installed into an Ingres 9.3 installation fail with
**	    error messages E_LC0001 with internal status E_GC0021 (Requested
**	    association partner is unavailable).  Direct connects from
**	    pre-Ingres 9.3 clients fail in the same way.  The cause is that
**	    the pre-Ingres 9.3 clients still expect DUPLEX pipes, a property
**	    that was removed in prior enhancement as "unneeded" (but IS
**	    needed for backward compatibility to earlier clients).  Fix is to
**	    restore DUPLEX property to pipes.
**	10-Dec-2009 (Bruce Lunsford) Bug 123046 (and 122406)
**	    If send of peer info times out (such as over a WAN), then must
**	    cancel the pending IO before proceeding with error; else,
**	    undefined results later including likely ACCVIO in OS function.
**	    Not a problem prior to fix for bug 122406 because time outs
**	    were ignored and treated as success (not good either, but no
**	    ACCVIO and would generally work OK).  Also bumped timeout time
**	    from 100 to 1000 msecs to avoid unnecessary timeout failures
**	    over slow networks (like a WAN).
**	17-Dec-2009 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122536
**	    Add support for long identifiers.  For clarity/consistency,
**	    change length of static "local_host" from MAX_LOC(=260) to
**	    GC_HOSTNAME_MAX+1(=257).
**	    Use new format for connect peerinfo messages, which contain
**	    user and hostname; W9x not updated for this as it is no longer
**	    supported.
**	    Also improve performance in GCusername (affects connect requests
**	    primarily) by only checking 1st time in for TNG/embedded Ingres
**	    installation.
**	14-Jan-2010 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122536 addendum
**	    With the orginal change for this sir, when a GC CL peer info
**	    message in the new longname format was received, the userid
**	    from the message (sent by client) was being returned to
**	    the GClisten() caller rather than the "OS-retrieved" pipe owner.
**	    These values "should" be the same anyway, but the pipe owner
**	    is a more trusted/reliable value for identifying the client-side
**	    user.  This is now consistent with pre-longname format behavior.
**	    Also, send peer info as variable length (only what is needed)
**	    rather than full max fixed length message; uses less
**	    (network) overhead and matches Unix behavior.  On the receiving
**	    end, this change requires tightening up the check to determine
**	    the type of incoming peer info message (previously counted on
**	    unique length only).
**	13-Apr-2010 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122679
**	    Add support for net drivers like "tcp_ip" as local IPC.
**	    New functions named GCDriver* were added for calling net
**	    driver(s)--versus the default of executing the pipes protocol
**	    logic, which was modified as little as possible.
**	    Added calls out to gcarw.c functions (ported from Unix)
**	    to implement multiplexing of the normal and expedited channels
**	    for an association over a single network connection (1 per
**	    association -> pipes uses 4 pipe connections per association!).
**	    File gcarw.c has driver functions GCDriver[Receive,Send,Purge,
**	    Disconn]; the others (for connect and listen) are in this file.
**	    NOTE that driver logic is only used if II_GC_PROT environment/
**	    Ingres variable is set to "tcp_ip" or one of the other protocols
**	    listed in the new gcacl PCT (protocol control table).
**	    Status codes returned from the network driver are remapped to
**	    valid gcacl status codes, which are later remapped (in GCA) to
**	    GCA status codes.  Not remapping the driver statuses causes
**	    error message file lookup problems because the converted GCA
**	    status won't be valid (see gc.h and gca.h for valid mappings).
**	    FYI: Unix BS statuses don't get converted to GCF statuses, so
**	    don't experience the same problem.
**	    For readability:
**	    - Reorganize location of functions within file:
**	        External and related, common, named pipe, network protocol
**	        driver, windows 95 anonymous pipes, and DEBUG routines.
**	    - Add long asterisks lines to start and end of function flowerboxes
**	      for those that were missing.
**	    Add svc_parm to fn entry traces in a consistent manner and made
**	    miscellaneous other trace improvements.
**	    With local IPC set to "tcp_ip", direct connects from Unix/Linux
**	    from compatible machines are now supported for Ingres versions
**	    r3/2006 and later.  Due to increased access, added requirement
**	    that direct access from remotes must be configured (II_GC_REMOTE)
**	    in server (same as Unix); this also applies now to remote access
**	    via named pipes from remote Windows machines.
**
**	    Set local_host to "true" local hostname with GetComputerName()
**	    rather than using GChostname(), which can be influenced by
**	    II_HOSTNAME variable.  "local_host" is used in peer info message
**	    processing and is used somewhat to determine if connection is
**	    local or remote and is part of security checking.
**
**	    For pipes, preallocate IOCBs for sends and receives once at
**	    connection start and free at disconnect.  This avoids the
**	    overhead of allocating and freeing on each send and receive.
**	    (Not applicable to the net driver logic, which doesn't use
**	    IOCBs for sends and receives.)
**
**	    Make disconnect safer by not considering IO complete until
**	    the caller's completion routine for the IO has returned, not
**	    just that the physical IO callback has been entered.
**
**	    Change default pipe size from 4096 to 12288 to match Unix and
**	    new tcp_ip packet size (for performance).
**	28-May-2010 (Bruce Lunsford) Bug 123827
**	    Fix for minor problem in last change for sir 122679.
**	    Lowercase the pipe owner since userid is not case-sensitive
**	    on Windows (and to be consistent with GCusername).  Otherwise,
**	    can get a trace WARNING in listen complete when pipe owner
**	    doesn't match the user sent by the client when Ingres run
**	    as a service (SYSTEM vs system).
**	16-Aug-2010 (Bruce Lunsford) Bug 124263
**	    Ingstart.exe may crash or take (up to 30 seconds) longer than it
**	    should to start Ingres if II_GC_PROT=tcp_ip (from sir 122679).
**      13-Jul-2011 (hanal04) SIR 125458
**          Update cs_elog calls inline with sc0e_putAsFcn changes.

/******************************************************************************
** Name: GCregister - Server start-up notification
**
** Description:
** This routine is called by GCA_REGISTER on server start-up.  It is
** used to notify the GCA CL that a server has been started.
**
** It is in this routine that the invoking server's name is assigned.  This is
** done by a system-specific mechanism that ensures the assignment of a uniquue
** name.  This is the public external name which would be specified to GCrequest
** to initiate an association with the server.  This is returned to the
** invoker for his information.
**
** If appropriate for the particular system-dependent implementation, any
** set-up operations for subsequently establishing an IPC connection with a
** requesting client may be done at this time.  It may be assumed that the
** routine GClisten will be called subsequently.
**
** If IPC setup is done here, the following is applicable.  Otherwise, it
** applies to the GClisten function.
**
** The external specification for GCA allows normal and expedited data flows.
** The exact implementation of these is system dependent.  Where appropriate and
** doable, a separate channel may be established for each flow type.  If this
** is not possible, the same channel may be used for both.
**
** GCregister has no input parameters per-se.  It is passed a pointer to the
** svc_parms structure for this request, which contains the output elements.
**
** The server's name is established by creating a named pipe with a
** specified name.  It is of the form XXXX\pid, where XXXX is a
** server type designator and pid is the local process identifier.
** The only exception is the name server, which is just "IINMSVR".
** Thus, simultaneously, the unique server name is established and
** the endpoint which will subsequently be used for the "listen"
** function is created.  We save the pipe handle created by this
** action for later use.
**
** We set name_server_flag for GCN so that we do *not* make a
** unique name for it.  For other servers, we may have more
** than one going at a time, with disambiguation
** requirements.  With GCN, we will never have more than one,
** and we *really* want to know where it is.
**
** Inputs:
**  svc_parms               Pointer to the service parameter list, to
**                          find the output elements
**
** Outputs:
**  svc_parms->listen_id    The server name assigned to the invoker.
**
**  svc_parms->status       Success or failure indication.
**      OK                  Normal completion
**      GC_LSN_FAIL         Unable to establish listen path
**
**  svc_parms->sys_err      OS-specific status info, returned in
**                  	    a CL_SYS_ERR structure.
**
** Returns:
**     VOID
** Exceptions:
**     none
**
** Side Effects:
**     none
**
** History:
**	13-nov-95 (emmag)
**	    Modified to use four pipes instead of two.
**	19-apr-1999 (somsa01)
**	    create the pipes after normal initialization. This way, when a
**	    client tries to connect during a server-side startup, the client
**	    will not get back an error but rather wait for the initialization
**	    of the server to complete.
**      01-Oct-1999 (fanra01)
**          Add the creation of the asyncIoComplete event.  This event is
**          created with the inheritance attribute enabled for use in GCsave
**          and GCrestore.
**	12-may-2000 (somsa01)
**	    Obtain the connect limit here and hold onto it.
**	10-Feb-2004 (drivi01)
**	    Removed routine that retrieves connect_limit from config.dat.
**	17-Dec-2009 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122536
**	    Remove allocation of access_point_identifier area at end of
**	    asipc; it is no longer used.
**	13-Apr-2010 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122679
**	    If net driver selected, call it with GCC_OPEN instead of embedded
**	    named pipes logic. Rearrange code so that pipes-specific code is
**	    together (at bottom of function).
**	    Remove unneeded variable commServerListenPipe.
**	    Preallocate IOCBs for pipe sends and receives (for performance).

/******************************************************************************
** Name: GCrequest - Build connection to peer entity
**
** Description:
**
** This routine is called by gca_request, as a result of a request by a
** client for a connection to a server.  The server must have issued a
** GCA_LISTEN service request in order to have prepared to accept an IPC
** connection.
**
** A local, system-dependent IPC connection is built to the listening server.
** An initial communication takes place with the server, sending a structure
** any system-specific information required by the implementation.
**
** The transmission buffer/segment size is set here.  The
** gca_size_advise parameter is set in the svc_parms parm list to specify
** the optimum buffer size to use if so desired.  A value of 0 indicates
** that the concept of buffer size optimization is irrelevant in this
** environment.
**
** a CL-internal data structure known generically as the Local Control Block
** (LCB) is allocated, and a pointer to it is set in the ACB.  The LCB
** contains system dependent data elements required for subsequent
** communication over the local IPC connection.  Its structure and content
** are unknown to the mainline code above the CL.
**
** Upon completion, the completion exit routine pointed to by the svc_parms
** parameter list is to be called.
**
** All parameters (both input and output) are handled via a pointer to
** SVC_PARMS structure containing the following elements ...
**
** Inputs:
**   svc_parms              Pointer to GCA service parmeter list containing:
**     (*gca_cl_completion)() Routine to call on completion.
**     partner_host           host name of partner to which connection is
**                            requested...may be NULL.
**     partner_name           port name of partner to which connection is
**                            requested.
**     time_out               timeout in ms. 0=poll, -1=no timeout
**
** Outputs:
**  svc_parms->size_advise  Suggested buffer size for communication
**                          optimization.
**
**  svc_parms->gc_cb        Pointer to the LCB.
**
**  svc_parms->status       Success or failure indication.
**      OK                  Normal completion
**      GC_RQ_FAIL          Request failure: connection problem
**      GC_RQ_RESOURCE      Request failure: server resource shortage
**      GC_NO_PARTNER       Requested partner not available
**
**  svc_parms->sys_err      OS-specific status info, returned in
**                          a CL_SYS_ERR structure.
**
** Returns:
**     none
**
** Exceptions:
**     none
**
** Side Effects:
**     Pipe handles are inheritable by child processes.
**
** History:
**      09-Sep-1999 (fanra01)
**          Changed infinite connect to retry every PIPE_RETRY_SLEEP.
**          Prevents the hang when the listening pipe is created but the
**          ConnectNamedPipe is not invoked until after the WaitNamedPipe call.
**          Moved Sleep from wait retry loop as invoked for every iteration
**          even if successful.
**      01-Oct-1999 (fanra01)
**          Bug 99023
**          Free memory when error encountered.
**      01-Oct-1999 (fanra01)
**          Add the creation of the asyncIoComplete event.  This event is
**          created with the inheritance attribute enabled for use in GCsave
**          and GCrestore.
**          Add indication of infinite timeout so that for status is set for
**          real timeout cases.
**	04-may-2000 (somsa01)
**	    Reworked for loop when attempting to connect to the named
**	    pipe to follow more closely the logic on UNIX. We now loop
**	    for a maximum of the timeout (in PIPE_RETRY_SLEEP chunks) or
**	    PIPE_RETRIES (in the case of an infinite timeout). Also, make
**	    sure that 'svc_parms->gc_cb' is set to NULL if we have to free
**	    up the asipc, so that cleanup routines do not end up freeing
**	    up a piece of memory which has already been freed (thus
**	    causing a SEGV).
**      07-feb-2006 (Ralph Loen) Bug 115730 
**          Increase wait time from two minutes to three minutes when the 
**          caller has requested an infinite wait.  Only invoke SleepEx()
**          if called from a server.
**      27-apr-2006 (Ralph Loen) Bug 116112
**          Report timeout errors as GC_TIME_OUT rather than GC_NO_PARTNER.
**	29-Apr-2009 (Bruce Lunsford) Bug 122009
**	    DAS can hang for minutes if multiple concurrent connects.
**	    DBMS is waiting to receive peer info for session from DAS while
**	    DAS is waiting on 2nd session trying to connect to named pipe
**	    instance, which DBMS won't create until he gets peer info for 1st
**	    session.  DAS's send of peerinfo for 1st session can get queued
**	    behind 2nd session connect.  Fix is to make connection processing
**	    asynchronous, which will also significantly improve performance
**	    for all servers when many connections are being requested. 
**	    Split sections of GCrequest() out to separate functions
**	    GCrequest2, GCrequestSendPeer, & GCconnectToServerPipe to
**	    better handle async code (more modular).  For instance, if
**	    connect to server pipe instance does not occur immediately
**	    in GCrequest(), it will spawn off a new thread GCrequest2()
**	    to complete connection processing ... thus avoiding blocking
**	    the main thread (for ASYNC GCrequest() calls only).
**	    Also:
**	    - Move call of GChostname to initialization to be done once
**	      rather than for each connect to improve performance, since it
**	      issues NMgtAt and calls OS function.
**	    - asipc->SndStdName was not getting set when pipe connected from
**	      within WaitNamedPipe loop.
**	    - Remove code related to GCN<->GCC deadlock detection since no
**	      longer needed with async connect capability.

**	    Save the (connect_)iocb address in the asipc for driver

/******************************************************************************
** Name: GCrequest2 - 2nd part of connection processing
**
** Description:
**
** This routine handles the 2nd part of connection processing.
** It may be called directly or run as a separate thread by GCrequest().
**
** The purpose of running under a separate thread is to allow connection
** processing to be run asynchronously from the caller's thread when the
** requested mode is ASYNChronous.  The separate thread is required
** because the pipe connect function is SYNChronous and, hence, will
** block, which is not allowed (bad for performance and could cause hangs).
**
** This routine is called directly if GCrequest mode is SYNC or if the
** initial attempt to connect to the server pipe in GCrequest() completed
** immediately (in which case, initial pipe connection has already occurred).
**
** Whether called directly or in a separate thread, the basic logic is the
** same for completing connection processing.  The difference is how
** the callback of the GCrequest completion routine is handled.
** If called directly, then the completion routine can be called directly.
** If under a different thread, then the initial thread must be notified
** when it is time to run the completion routine.  This is done by
** queuing a User APC to the originating thread with a completion value
** pointing to a routine that will then run the GCrequest completion routine.
**
** Another difference is that the code below (including called functions)
** must be careful not to block if this routine was called directly
** with the GCrequest mode ASYNC.
** 
**
** Inputs:
**   svc_parms              Pointer to GCA service parmeter list containing:
**     gc_cb                  Pointer to the LCB (ASSOC_IPC)
**
** Outputs:
**  svc_parms->size_advise  Suggested buffer size for communication
**                          optimization.
**
**  svc_parms->status       Success or failure indication.
**      OK                  Normal completion
**      GC_RQ_FAIL          Request failure: connection problem
**      GC_RQ_RESOURCE      Request failure: server resource shortage

** History:
**	29-Apr-2009 (Bruce Lunsford) Bug 122009
**	    Extracted from GCrequest() so that it could be called directly
**	    and handle running in the original or a spawned thread.
**	    Also, moved code unrelated to send peer elsewhere.
**	04-Aug-2009 (Bruce Lunsford) Bug 122009 and 122406
**	    After previous fix (for bug 122009), direct connect fails with
**	    error messages E_LC0001 GCA protocol service (GCA_REQUEST) failure
**	    plus E_LQ0001.  Prior fix had failed to set status=OK after
**	    I/O for "sync send" did not complete immediately, which is
**	    normal for direct connects across the network; status was
**	    still set to ERROR_IO_PENDING, even after I/O completed.
**	    Also, enhance error handling to catch all potential errors.
**	    Remove unneeded ResetEvent() since the event handle is closed
**	    when exiting anyway.
**	    Remove unneeded CloseHandle on the send pipe after an error
**	    since it will be closed at end of session anyway (along
**	    with all the other pipes); also, closing it without setting
**	    asipc->SndStdChan to NULL could result in a double close on
**	    the handle.
**	10-Dec-2009 (Bruce Lunsford) Bug 123046 (and 122406)
**	    If send of peer info times out (such as over a WAN), then must
**	    cancel the pending IO before proceeding with error; else,
**	    undefined results later including likely ACCVIO in OS function.
**	    Not a problem prior to fix for bug 122406 because time outs
**	    were ignored and treated as success (not good either, but no
**	    ACCVIO and would generally work OK).
**	    Improve comments for WFSOex of the WriteFile event.
**	    Add #define for SEND_WAIT_TIME_MSECS and replace/remove
**	    misleading SLEEP_TIME_MSECS.  Also bump from 100 to 1000
**	    milliseconds to avoid timeouts over slow WANs; 300 msecs
**	    worked 80% of the time in testing.
**	    Add curly brackets to surround single GCTRACE's within an
**	    else condition since GCTRACE is itself #defined to a multiline
**	    "if x, then y" statement sequence; fixes erroneous matching of
**	    nested if's and else's that follow.
**	17-Dec-2009 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122536
**	    Add support for long identifiers.  Use/create new format (v2) for
**	    connection peer info (CONNECT) that provides for longer names.
**	14-Jan-2010 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122536 addendum
**	    Send peer info as variable length (only what is needed)
**	    rather than full max fixed length message to make compatible
**	    with Unix and use slightly less (network) overhead.
**	13-Apr-2010 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122679
**	    Add prefix filler to connect peer info message area; this is
**	    used by called GC CL lower layers to store GC_MTYP and tcp_ip
**	    2-byte length prefix.
**	    Add optional input parm iocb_in which will be used if not NULL;
**	    needed for driver logic which already has an ASYNC_IOCB.
**	16-Aug-2010 (Bruce Lunsford) Bug 124263
**	    Return OK rather than svc_parms->status after call to
**	    GCDriverSendPeer() since lower layers will handle errors and
**	    call the completion routine appropriately themselves.

/******************************************************************************
**
** Name: GClisten - Establish a server connection with a client
**
** Description:
**
** This routine is, by definition, a server-only function.
**
** This routine establishes a system-specific "read" on the local IPC
** connection previously set up by the GCA_REGISTER service.  This places
** the server in the position of listening for an association request from a
** client.  The completion of the GCA_LISTEN request occurs when a connection
** to the IPC mechanism is made by a client, and a packet of associated data
** is received.  The invoker of GCA_LISTEN is notified of completion by the
** driving of his completion exit, if one was specified and the request was
** asynchronous.  Otherwise, completion is implied by return of control.
**
** It allocates and records in the ACB addressed from the SVC_PARMS structure
** the address of a CL connection control block whose content and structure
** are system-specific.  It is used by this and other CL routines which deal
** with the local IPC connection established by the completion of the
** GCA_LISTEN request.  This data structure is known as the Local Control
** Block (LCB).
**
** In the event of a local failure or resource shortage or other condition
** preventing the successful establishment of the requested connection, there
** should be some mechanism for notifying the client of this so the client does
** not hang on a pending association.  This requires coordination between the
** GClisten and the GCrequest functions.  The exact mechanism is
** system-dependent.
**
** Upon completion, the completion exit routine pointed to by the svc_parms
** parameter list is to be called.  Also, the flag in the ACB called
** acb.starting is set to 0 to indicate that a connection has been established.
**
** All parameters (both input and output) are handled via a pointer to
** SVC_PARMS structure containing the following elements ...
**
** Inputs:
**
**  svc_parms                Pointer to GCA service parmeter list containing:
**   (*gca_cl_completion)()  Routine to call on completion.
**
** Outputs:
**  gc_cb                    CL connection block
**
**  access_point_identifier     A pointer to a character string which
**                              represents the "terminal" through which
**                              the request came.  This is used for
**                              authentication, and is sytem-dependent.
**
**  user_name                   A pointer to a character string which
**                              identifies the client from which
**                              the request came.  This is used for
**                              authentication, and is sytem-dependent.
**
**  size_advise                 Suggested buffer size for communication
**
**  status              Success or failure indication.

**      GC_ASSOC_FAIL   A received association request could not
**                      be successfully completed.
**      GC_LSN_FAIL     No GCA register call was done, or some
**                      system-specific failure occurred which
**                      prevented the listen from being
**                      established.
**      GC_LSN_RESOURCE Resource shortage in server
**
**  sys_err             OS-specific status info, returned in
**                      a CL_SYS_ERR structure.
**
** Returns:
**     none
** Exceptions:
**     none
**
** History:
**	19-apr-1999 (somsa01)
**	    Do not create the pipes when GC_IO_CREATED is set.
**      14-Sep-1999 (fanra01)
**          Save the current thread id.  The listen will only complete when
**          called from a GCsync in this thread.
**	06-Aug-2009 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122426
**	    Remove mutexing around calls to GCA service completion routine
**	    as it is no longer necessary, since GCA is thread-safe...removes
**	    GCwaitCompletion + GCrestart.  This should improve peformance.
**	    Convert CreateThread() to _beginthreadex() which is recommended
**	    when using C runtime.
**	17-Dec-2009 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122536
**	    Remove unused access_point_identifier area at end of asipc used 
**	    to store string version of pid.  Access_point_identifier is
**	    obtained from received peer info (aka, connect) message..
**	13-Apr-2010 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122679

/******************************************************************************
**
** Name: GClisten2 - Listen phase 2
**
** Description:
**
** This is phase/part 2 that GClisten uses to connect a server to a client.
** An incoming network connection has been established.  Now issue read
** for connection data.
**
** History:
**      09-Sep-1999 (fanra01)
**          Check that we are in the listening threads context before we
**          continue.
**          Call GCcloseAllPipes on semaphore failure.
**          Changed overlapped event to manual reset. Add manual reset.
**	13-sep-2004 (somsa01)
**	    As an addendum to loera01's last change, lower-case the userid
**	    after obtaining it from the Pipe.
**	17-Dec-2009 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122536
**	    Add support for long identifiers.  Check for new format (v2) for
**	    connection peer info (CONNECT) that provides for longer names.
**	    Keep support for old format (V0) for backward compatibility with
**	    older clients...mostly needed for direct remote connections.
**	    Added function name, where missing, to start of GCTRACE stmts.
**	    Remove ultoa() of pid to unused access_point_identifier area at
**	    end of asipc; access_point_identifier is obtained from received
**	    peer info (aka, connect) message.
**	14-Jan-2010 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122536 addendum
**	    Pipe owner not returned as user for new long-name peer info fmt.
**	    With prior fix, user_name_len was never set (was still = 0)
**	    if new peer info format received.  This caused 
**	    GetNamedPipeHandleState() call to be a no-op.  Allocate a new
**	    area to store the pipe owner, which may be too long to overlay
**	    into incoming peer info message's user name field.  Added trace
**	    if the userids don't match.
**	    Tighten up check to determine if incoming peer info is in new or
**	    original format since new format is now being sent as variable
**	    length; ie, add check for constant value in new format's id field.
**	13-Apr-2010 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122679
**	    With drivers, this function is now called directly instead
**	    of due to the setting of the LISTEN event.  In the driver
**	    direct-call scenario, no need to check if this is a listen
**	    thread...will be checked later in driver's LISTEN event_func,
**	    which is GClisten2_complete().
**	    Split out common code at end to a separate function,
**	    GClisten2_complete(), that can also be called/shared
**	    by a driver listen at the end of its processing,
**	    as well as by the inline pipe processing below.
**	    Cleaned up handling of Overlapped.hEvent.
**	28-May-2010 (Bruce Lunsford) Bug 123827
**	    Lowercase the pipe owner since userid is not case-sensitive
**	    on Windows (and to be consistent with GCusername).  Otherwise,
**	    can get a trace WARNING in listen complete when pipe owner
**	    doesn't match the user sent by the client when Ingres run
**	    as a service (SYSTEM vs system).

/******************************************************************************
**
** Name: GClisten2_complete - Listen phase 2 COMPLETION
**
** Description:
**
** This is the completion routine for GClisten_2.  It is called when the
** connection data from the client has been received or an error occurred
** on the read.  Check for errors; if OK, process the incoming connection
** data, which should be in one of several release-dependent formats.
** Lastly, call the GClisten caller's completion routine to complete
** listen processing.
**
** History:
**	13-Apr-2010 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122679
**	    Created...extracted from last half of GClisten2() so it
**	    could be called by driver and pipes code.  Made this the
**	    event_func[LISTEN] for drivers (instead of GClisten2) to
**	    deal with the way the DBMS in CSsuspend() treats the
**	    signaling of the LISTEN event.  In addition to invoking
**	    the associated function, it signals to the DBMS that the
**	    listen has completed when the associated function returns.
**
**	    Added support for incoming previous Unix/Linux peerinfo
**	    formats V0 and V1 since direct connect is now supported
**	    from those non-Windows platforms if using TCP_IP as the
**	    local IPC.  Due to this "opening up" of direct connect
**	    access, the same protections that exist on Unix servers
**	    was added for Windows.  That is, direct connect from
**	    remote machines must have direct connect enabled in the
**	    DBMS server configuration.
**
**	    Reworked code a bit by adding "for(;;)" wrapper and using
**	    break statements instead of using GCerror() macro.  Helps
**	    a little with the flow (and matches better with Unix).
**
**	    Also reinstated setting of "trusted" flag, modeled after
**	    Unix, and removed corresponding commented-out code that
**	    existed before for Windows.

**
** History:
**      12-Nov-96 (fanra01)
**          Removed the DisconnectNamedPipe so that disconnect on NT reflects
**          the actions of Windows 95.
**      02-jun-1997 (canor01)
**          Try to get disconnect message delivered before closing
**          the pipes.
**      17-Sep-1999 (fanra01)
**          Modified the disconnect which ensures that the higher level
**          message is read by the partner before the pipes are diconnected.
**          Tries to minimise the number of calls to SleepEx to improve
**          performance.
**      01-Oct-1999 (fanra01)
**          Add asyncIoPending counter to determine if IOs have completed.
**          When the last IO completes the asyncIoComplete event is signalled
**          allowing GCdisconn to continue.  This removes the need to use
**          SleepEx to make the thread alertable.
**      03-Dec-1999 (fanra01)
**          Close the receive handles if this is a comms server to prevent peer
**          from sending anymore data and to force outstanding I/Os to
**          complete.
**          Modified the function to wait for all outstanding I/Os to complete
**          before continuing with the disconnect.
**          Allow disconnect function to return and call completion
**          asynchronously.
**      31-Jan-2000 (fanra01)
**          Close the receive handles.
**      31-Jan-2000 (fanra01)
**          Bug
**          If the listener is terninating the connection close the receive
**          handles to force the outstanding async I/Os to complete.
**      01-Jul-2005 (lunbr01) Bug 109115
**          "Direct" connections fail against gateway servers due to the
**          disconnect issued by gateway daemon after handing off session
**          to gateway slave process.  The fix is to not write a
**          0 byte message to the send pipe if it is a gateway daemon
**          process.  This was actually implemented more generically->
**          if we are a server (listening) and have GCsave'd our connection
**          (presumably for use by another process, such as a
**          gateway slave), then skip the write.
**          This problem was timing dependent-- ie, didn't always occur.
**          May be a better way to eliminate the failure (note that
**          the application thinks session has been ended if he gets
**          a 0 byte message).
**      26-Aug-2005 (lunbr01) Bug 115107 + 109115
**          Out of stack memory error causes GCC to crash.  Eliminate nested
**          calls to async IO completion routines which Microsoft says can
**          chew up memory in the stack.  This condition can occur in
**          GCdisconn() when triggered by a killed application (failed recv).
**          Removed the WFSOex() loop invoked here, which was used to allow
**          pending IOs to complete. This was removed because we might be
**          executing in the context of an async completion routine (eg, a
**          failed receive).  Instead, just return and let GCasyncDisconn()
**          be invoked later from GCCompletionRoutine() when the session's
**          async IO pending count reaches zero.  The previous fix for
**          "direct connect" (bug 109115) is no longer needed because we
**          no longer need to do the 0-byte write either.

** Name: GCsend - Send data on an association
**
** Description:
** Send data to the other party in the connection.  This routine simulates
** byte-stream I/O, and utilizes the system-specific IPC mechanism in whatever
** way is necessary to create this illusion.
**
** The user of this routine has requested svc_parms->svc_send_length bytes
** of data to be sent on the outgoing message stream.  This is to be done in a
** single operation from the caller's point of view; i.e., the operation is
** not complete until the caller's entire buffer has been sent.  The exact
** meaning of "sent" is implementation specific, but the data in the caller's
** buffer must be in a safe harbor, and the caller must be able to re-use the
** buffer.  The data sent as the outgoing message stream is read from the
** address starting at svc_parms->svc_buffer.
**
** This routine must issue the sequence of write requests
** necessary to send the entire buffer, and track any excess outgoing
** data not yet requested or needed.  The breaking down of the
** input data buffer into transmission segment sizes is performed
** here.
**
** The parameter svc_parms->(*gca_cl_completion)() specifies a
** completion exit to be invoked when the request is complete.  This exit is
** called for either synchronous or asynchronous requests.  The invocation of
** this exit implies to the mainline that the send buffer may now be reused.
**
** Possible error conditions are as follows:
** If the connection to the partner is unexpectedly gone, a status of
** GC_ASSOC_FAIL is returned.  If the connection has been terminated locally,
** by the GCdisconn function, a status of GC_ASSN_RLSED is returned.  The
** ability to detect these two modes of disconnection is system dependent.
** If the distinction cannot be made in a particular implementation, a status
** of GC_ASSOC_FAIL is the default.  GC_ASSOC_FAIL normally covers network
** errors from which recovery is impossible.
**
** All parameters (both input and output) are handled via a pointer to
** SVC_PARMS structure containing the following elements ...
**
** Inputs:
**  flags.flow_indicator    Normal/Expedited flow indicator

** Name: GCreceive - Receive data on an association
**
** Description:
**
** The user of this routine has requested svc_parms->reqd_amount bytes
** of data from the incoming message stream.
** The data read from the incoming messages is placed at the
** address starting at svc_parms->svc_buffer.
**
** The model of data transfer presented to the invoker is that of a byte stream.
** This routine must issue the sequence of system-specific read requests
** necessary to support this and buffer any excess incoming
** data not yet requested.  GCreceive must perform a sequence of recieve
** operations which results in the filling of the caller's buffer, i.e., the
** operation proceeds until sufficient data have been received to satisfy the
** caller's request.  Except under unrecoverable error conditions, the caller
** never receives less than was asked for.  The reconstruction of the final
** output buffer from the segmented transmission buffers is also
** done here.
**
** The GCreceive function must be capable of recoginzing a special "end of file"
** condition on the receive channel.  The implementation of this  condition is
** system-dependent.  It may utilize a system provided capability, or it may
** be implemented in some other way, such as a special data pattern or a

**
** svc_parms contains an indicator flags.new_chop.  This indicator is set TRUE
** if an end-of-file is received.  Otherwise, is set false.
**
** The flags.flow_indicator element of svc_parms specifies whether the receive
** function is to be issued on the normal or expedited flow channel.
**
** A synchronous request may specify a timeout limit.  This means that if
** has been received by the expiration, the returned status is set to
** GC_TIME_OUT and the request is terminated, with system-specific
** being done as required.
**
** The parameter svc_parms->(*gca_cl_completion)(svc_parms) specifies a
** completion exit to be invoked when the request is complete.  This exit is
** called for either synchronous or asynchronous requests.

**      26-Dec-2001 (lunbr01) Bug 105902
**          Created.  Copied from GCCompletionRoutine() so that code can 
**          be called from elsewhere (e.g., for sync reads).
**      09-Apr-2002 (ashco01) Bug 107527.
**          W95/98 clients can occasionally recieve a GC purge message
**          appended to the previous message buffer even though the
**          messages have been sent seperately. This would cause the
**          purge message to be missed and a GC receive wait to occur
**          causing the FE application to hang. This fix is a w95/98
**          client-side only change to check for the purge message at
**          the end of the current buffer if not already found at the
**          beginning.
**	12-Dec-2002 (lunbr01) Bug 108292
**	    Memory leak of 4-12K per connect/disconnect in comm server on
**	    client side.
**	08-apr-2003 (somsa01)
**	    In GCreceiveCompletion(), ammended lunbr01's fix for Bug 108292
**	    to specifically target the comm server. This was causing loss of
**	    GCA_RELEASE messages in the ICESVR.
**      10-May-2004 (lunbr01) Bug 107527.
**          Addendum to previous fix. Also allow for case where GC purge
**          message is not at the beginning or the end of the buffer, 
**          but is "near" the end and is followed only by a GCA_IACK
**          message, which is typically sent right after the GC purge.
**          Only occurs on W9x systems where we can't seem to force
**          the GC purge message to always travel alone.  If there are
**          any other combinations, it may be necessary to rework the
**          fix to scan the entire buffer; however, that could 
**          negatively impact performance. 
**          Check purge semaphore on comm servers now on W9x.
**	13-Apr-2010 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122679
**	    Since the asyncIoPending counter is now incremented AFTER
**	    rather than BEFORE calling this function, adjust check on
**	    asyncIoPending by 1 (was 1, now 2) in logic that checks for
**	    expedited receive failure indicating a disconnect in progress
**	    (versus an error).

**	30-Jan-97 (kitch01)
**		Bug 79293 purge problem on fast pentium machines.
**		Changed hPurgeEvent to hPurgeSemaphore to synchronize the purge
**		messages.
**      14-Oct-97 (fanra01)
**              Modified the conditions for when a FlushFileBuffer is called.
**              Should isolate the GC level purge message.
**	08-Feb-1999 (somsa01)
**	    If is_comm_svr was set, FlushFileBuffers() was executed to
**	    clear out the client read pipe. in other cases, we just did a
**	    wait. However, according to the Micorosft Visual C++
**	    documentation, FlushFileBuffers() will wait until any remaining
**	    data has been read by the client before flushing the pipe.
**	    Therefore, we can use this in ALL situations.
**	22-mar-1999 (somsa01)
**	    Replaced the second remaining PCsleep() with FlushFileBuffers().
**	    It is executed only if there is data left on the pipe after
**	    sending a PURGE message.
**	28-feb-2000 (somsa01 for lunbr01) Bug 95163 for W95
**	    Prior fix for this bug was made in NT-specific code. Implemented
**	    same change in W95. That is, remove PCsleeps in the GCpurge code,
**	    thus greatly improving performance in this area. Shared code as
**	    much as possible with NT.
**	29-Apr-2009 (Bruce Lunsford) Bug 122009
**	    Don't reissue redundant GetLastError() for input to SETWIN32ERR
**	    after WriteFile() error.
**	13-Apr-2010 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122679
**	    If net driver selected, call it (GCDriverPurge) instead of
**	    embedded pipes logic.

** Name: GCsync - wait for sync request to complete
**
** Description:
**  GCsync is called repeatedly while GCA mainline waits for
**  the last posted GCA CL request to complete.  If the
**  implementation requires, GCsync may poll for lower level
**  I/O operations; otherwise, GCsync should block and return
**  when the CL request completes.
**
**  GCsync may return before the last posted request completes,
**  and will be reinvoked by GCA.  For example, it may return
**  after each lower level I/O operation.
**
**  GCsync must also allow keyboard generated interrupts to
**  occur, but not while completions are being driven.
**
**  Since this call is only made by front ends that are doing one thing
**  at a time anyway, it suffices to have a very simple semaphore
**  scheme.
**
** History:
**      29-Feb-96 (fanra01)
**          Increased size of waitarray for extra event handle.
**          Moved initialisation of waitarray to before Is_w95 condition to
**          allows array use in GCF_EMBEDDED_GCC section for multiple wait.
**          Added gcc event for both w95 and NT.

**	    GCsync now takes a timeout value.
**      25-Jul-97 (fanra01)
**          Remove win 95 specific code.  No uses the same sync as NT.
**	31-mar-1999 (somsa01)
**	    Properly set up the number of events for Windows 95, as the
**	    TIMEOUT event is not valid on that platform.
**	12-Mar-2004 (inifa01) INGREP154 b111841
**	    repserver hangs using 99% CPU if the event timeout flag is
**	    set (ie -EVTn). 
**	    FIX: If timeout event previously occured and has been canceled
**	    don't load waitarray for current request with the invalid 
**	    canceled handle.
**	13-Apr-2010 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122679
**	    Remove ifdefs for embedded comm server i(GCF_EMBEDDED_GCC)
**	    around GCC_COMPLETE event.  Now always include it in the wait
**	    list since it will be used if a network protocol driver
**	    (like Winsock tcp_ip) is selected with II_GC_PROT.  If not,

** Name: GCnsid - Establish or obtain the identification of the local
**                Name Server
**
** Description:
**
**  GCnsid is invoked to establish and to obtain the identity of the Name
**  Server in a system-dependent way.  This function provides the
**  "bootstrapping" capability required to allow the GCA Connection
**  Manager to establish an association with the Name Server.
**
**  Two operations may be invoked: PUT and GET.  The former is invoked
**  by Name Server to establish its global identity in a system specific
**  way.  This identity is the "listen_id" which it establishes as a
**  normal server to allow clients to request associations.  The latter is
**  invoked by Connection Manager in order to obtain the listen_id which it
**  must use to create an association with Name Server.
**
**  The exact syntax of the identifier may be system dependent, although
**  this is not of concern to GCnsid.  The identifiier consists of a
**  nul-terminated character string.  It is established in a
**  system-dependent way so as to be globally accessible by all GCA
**  Connection Managers in the local node.
**
**
** Inputs:
**  flag            A constant value specifying the operation to be
**                  performed.  The following values are defined:
**                    GCN_SET_LISTENID   Establish a globally accessible
**                                       identifier for the Name Server.
**                    GCN_FIND_LISTENID  Retrieve the identifier of the
**                                       Name Server in the local node.
**
**  gca_listen_id   A pointer to an area containing
**                  the character string specifying
**                  the identity of the Name Server,
**                  if the operation is PUT, or an
**                  area in which to place the character
**                  string identifier if the operation
**                  is GET.
**
**  length          The length of listen_id to be set.
**
** Outputs (GCA_GET_NSID operation only):
**
**  *gca_listen_id          The Name Server identifier.
**
** Returns:

** Name:  GChostname    ... Request the local host name.
**
** Description:
**  Attempts to find the local host name as appropriate for a given

**
**  If the local host name cannot be found a NULL string is  returned
**  and the return code set to FAIL. This implies that the local

** Name:	GCCompletionRoutine
**
** Description: Completion routine for Async reads and writes.
**
** History:
**
**     13-jul-95 (emmag)
**         Since zero length messages were sometimes being lost on the pipe -
**	   replace them with a fixed lenght message.  Need to handle receipt
**	   of this message as though it were a zero byte read.
**     25-jul-95 (emmag)
**	   The chopmark coming from UNIX/VMS etc. will be a zero byte read
**	   Overlooked this case in my previous change.
**     29-dec-1995 (canor01)
**	   ERROR_PIPE_NOT_CONNECTED is possible value for dwError, though missing
**	   in documentation.
**     01-apr-1996 (canor01)
**	   An invalid connection can be manifested through an assoc_id
**	   of -1 or by a svc_parms->acb that is null.
**     23-apr-1996 (canor01)
**	   ERROR_BROKEN_PIPE is also possible value for dwError, though missing
**	   in documentation.
**	05-mar-1997 (canor01)
**	    Percolating pipe failures up to GCA seems to be a mistake.
**	    Do not execute GCA completion routine on ERROR_BROKEN_PIPE.
**	    This can cause AL FSM errors in GCC.
**      21-apr-1997 (canor01)
**          If the acb has been freed and the memory released, it will
**          not be NULL, but an invalid pointer.  Use IsBadReadPtr()
**          to verify it.
**      02-jun-1997 (canor01)
**	    Percolating pipe failures up to GCA is definitely the right
**	    thing to do.  Otherwise, GCC will not know to free memory
**	    reserved for the IO.  AL FSM errors avoided by synchronizing
**	    on GCdisconn.
**      04-Sep-97 (fanra01)
**          Replace the error indication to GCA completion removed in
**          integration.
**      14-Oct-97 (fanra01)
**          Modified the conditions for when a FlushFileBuffer is called.
**          Modified the check for a purge message.  Now check every message
**          using an integer eye-catcher compare.
**          If a message is concactinated strip of the internal message and
**          pass up the following message.
**	15-mar-1999 (somsa01)
**	    Partial x-integration of fix for Jasmine bug 95556; do not test
**	    for the purge message if dwNumberXfer is zero.
**      01-Oct-1999 (fanra01)
**          Add decrement of asyncIoPending counter.
**          If the asyncIoPending counter is 0 and GCdisconn flags as being
**          called the asyncIoComplete event is signaled to allow GCdisconn to
**          continue.
**      09-Dec-1999 (fanra01)
**          Use local variables for disconnect fields from asipc.
**	28-feb-2000 (somsa01 for lunbr01) Bug 99826 for W95
**	    Occasional hang on W95. GC_PURGE was being received (std chan)
**	    before GCA_ATTENTION (exp chan) in client-side GCC. Removed check
**	    that was preventing GC_PURGE semaphore logic from being executed
**	    in server processes. This hang occurred with and without fix for
**	    bug 95163; fix was made to common NT and W95 code, although bug
**	    only reported on W95.
**      27-sep-2001 (lunbr01) Bug 105902
**          Move logic to process a received message (such as checking for 
**          a purge message) to a separate function, GCreceiveCompletion().
**	29-Apr-2009 (Bruce Lunsford) Bug 122009
**	    Change GCasyncDisconn to GCasyncCompletion since it was renamed.
**	06-Aug-2009 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122426
**	    Remove mutexing around calls to GCA service completion routine
**	    as it is no longer necessary, since GCA is thread-safe...removes
**	    GCwaitCompletion + GCrestart.  This should improve peformance.
**	13-Apr-2010 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122679
**	    Remove MEfree(iocb) since the send/recv iocbs are now
**	    preallocated and not freed until disconnect.
**	    Defer decrementing asyncIoPending until after returning
**	    from the GCA completion routine to prevent possible nested
**	    call to GCdisconn and GCrelease thinking it OK to release
**	    resources.

** Name: GCasyncCompletion

** Description:
**	This function calls the completion routine for a request that 
**	completed in a thread other than the original thread of the
**	request.  This function is itself run as a completion routine
**	for a Windows User APC that is queued to the original thread.
**	There are 2 cases that use this:
**        1. ASYNC Connects that entered blocking code and were spawned
**	     off into a separate thread.
**        2. Disconnects after all I/Os have completed.
**      The thread must be in an alertable wait state for this function
**      to be executed.
**	TIP: There might be a temptation to eliminate this function
**	     and queue the UserAPC directly to the actual requester's
**	     completion routine since, as seen below, this routine does
**	     nothing more than turn around and call the requester's
**	     completion routine.  DON'T BOTHER! ... the call mechanism
**	     for this Windows UserAPC routine is WINAPI which is #defined
**	     to __stdcall, which is different from the default call
**	     mechanism which is used by all the Ingres programs.  If that
**	     were to ever get in sync, then this middle-man function could

** History:
**	23-Oct-2001 (lunbr01) Bug 105793 & 106119
**	    Move purge semaphore from global array to the per-session
**          ASIPC control block. This is much simpler and removes the 
**          restriction on max associations imposed by the pre-defined
**          array size. The sequential 1-100 sem_id portion of the
**          purge semaphore is replaced by the address of the ASIPC...
**          which is also unique within process.  The purge semaphore
**          will now be preserved across GCA_SAVE/GCA_RESTORE.
**	06-Dec-2006 (drivi01)
**	    Adding support for Vista, Vista requires "Global\" prefix for
**	    shared objects as well.  Replacing calls to GVosvers with 
**	    GVshobj which returns the prefix to shared objects.

**	14-mar-1996 (canor01)
**	    Max number of connections may be greater than 255, but

**	03-apr-1996 (canor01)
**	    Clean up code. Move MEfree's to proper place.
**	20-apr-1996 (canor01)
**	    If the pipe is busy, retry.
**	22-apr-1996 (canor01)
**	    Max number of pipes is greater than max number of
**	    connections to allow for the listen thread's pipes
**	    to stay active.
**      09-Sep-1999 (fanra01)
**          Moved Sleep from loop to individual retry.
**          Move GetLastError calls before calling GCcloseAllPipes.
**      09-Dec-1999 (fanra01)
**          Only retry pipes which have not previously been created or failed
**          to be created.
**	05-may-2000 (somsa01, lunbr01)
**	    Moved creation of the RcvStdChan to the top to speed up client
**	    connections.
**	12-may-2000 (somsa01)
**	    Moved PMget() of the connect limit to GCregister().
**	10-Feb-2005 (drivi01)
**	    Instead of obtaining connect_limit from config.dat and setting
**	    num_pipes to connect_limit, we now set it to PIPE_UNLIMITED_INSTANCES.
**	    GC should not be trying to limit the number of pipes created for
**	    communication, server should have control over how many connections
**	    can be obtained.
**	06-Aug-2009 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122426
**	    DUPLEX on pipes is unnecessary...change to 1-directional

** a CreateNamedPipe on its matching pipe (RcvStd).
**
** When this routine is called, it is assumed that an unsuccessful attempt
** to connect to the pipe has already been made, so the logic begins with
** a WaitNamedPipe() rather than a CreateFile().
**
** Once the initial server pipe is connected to, the caller can continue
** by connecting to the remaining pipes (GCconnectToStandardPipes()).

**
** History:
**      09-Sep-1999 (fanra01)
**          Add handle checks prior to CreateFile for retry loop.  Don't
**          recreate handles.
**          Add retry on pipe busy and release of resources on error.
**	29-Apr-2009 (Bruce Lunsford) Bug 122009
**	    Moved logic that built pipe names to GCrequest() so that it
**	    is already done and stored in the asipc; hence, no need to
**	    pass partner_name anymore as a parameter.  This was not a
**	    critical thing to do...just helped with organization of pipe
**	    naming logic.
**	06-Aug-2009 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122426
**	    Remove unnecessary optons GENERIC_READ & FILE_SHARE_WRITE from
**	    sending pipes, GENERIC_WRITE & FILE_SHARE_READ from receiving
**	    pipes, and FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL from all pipes.

**          message (+misc) in sync receive logic--
**          previously only done for async in GCCompletionRoutine.
**      19-Jan-2006 (lunbr01) Bug 115622
**          Slow performance for syncronous receives with timeout value (not
**          0 or -1).  Prior code used PeekNamedPipe plus 100 msec Sleep
**          in a loop to check for input before issuing read.  The slowness
**          was due to dropping into the Sleep when input was not already
**          present.  Fix removed Peek/Sleep code and replaced with timeout
**          value on WFSO after read plus cancelIO if timeout occurred.
**      12-Jan-2007 (lunbr01) Bug 117257
**          "Copy in data" is slower after fix for bug 115622.  This is
**          due to frequent expedited sync GCA_RECEIVEs with a zero timeout 
**          being issued by "copy in"...aka "copy from file".  Usually,
**          a timeout error is produced because there is nothing to receive
**          from the server.  The performance difference is due to it taking
**          longer in the code now to determine that there is no data.
**          Added code similar to pre-115622 that, in this case, would do a
**          PeekNamedPipe() and bail right away if nothing is there, 
**          instead of scheduling I/O, waiting on it for zero time, and then
**          having to cancel the I/O (in case some came through afterwards).
**          The PeekNamedPipe approach has less system overhead.

**      01-Oct-1999 (fanra01)
**          Removed 0 length writes on receive pipes as all IO should be

**      Wrapper function for the GCcompletionRoutine.
**      User APCs can take only one DWORD parameter so the information must be
**      saved into a structure.  This assumes that a DWORD matches a pointer
**      in size.
**
**      This function will be called in the context of the thread identified
**      by the pIoparms->hCmpltThread parameter.
**      This should be the thread which invoked the I/O function and which is
**      also in an alertable wait state.
**
** Inputs:
**      pIoparms    I/O parameters which are required for asynchronous
**                  completion.
**
** Outputs:
**      None.
**
** Returns:
**      None.
**
** History:
**      25-Jul-97 (fanra01)

**      Create the read thread and return.
**
**      For synchronous reads perform the read and execute gca complete.
