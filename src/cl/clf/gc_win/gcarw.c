** Name: GCARW.C - GCsend(), GCreceive(), GCpurge(), GCdisconn()
**
** Description:
**	Sender, Receiver
**	
**	NOTE!! Keep IN SYNC with Unix version for generic (non-OS-specific)
**	changes.
**
**	Copied from Unix version of gcarw.c and then modified for
**	Windows.  This file was needed to implement multiplexed
**	sends and receives of the gcacl channels (normal and 
**	expedited) over a single network connection.  The code
**	is not needed or used for the original, native implementations
**	of gcacl over pipes ("named" for Windows NT, "anonymous" for W9x).
**	However, it IS used to implement "tcp_ip" (and theoretically
**	any Windows GCC network protocol driver) as the local IPC
**	protocol, which is enabled by setting II_GC_PROT environment
**	variable.  With the pipes implementation, each gcacl channel
**	was mapped to a separate physical pipe.  With the network 
**	protocol driver implementation, only 1 physical network connection
**	is set up per session; hence, the send and receive requests
**	for the normal and expedited channels must be multiplexed
**	over the same physical network connection.  
**
**	Another reason to use the same code/implementation as Unix is that
**	GCpurge is also implemented in this program and, hence, now
**	done the same way.  For pipes, GCpurge is implemented by sending
**	a message containing the text "IIPRGMSG".  For tcp_ip, 2 chopmarks
**	are sent and received; chopmarks are basically empty messages
**	that contain only the multiplexing prefix.
**
**	Because the multiplexing and GCpurge handling is now the same
**	for "tcp_ip" between Windows and Unix, "direct connect" can 
**	be used between Ingres's on the 2 different platforms as long
**	as the other criteria for "direct connect" are satisfied
**	(eg, same integer formats, float formats, charsets).
**          Add support for net drivers like "tcp_ip" as local IPC.
**
**	The main differences of gcarw.c on Windows versus Unix are:
**	1. There is no BSP network driver interface on Windows.
**	   Though a BSP interface could be created (with a lot of work),
**	   the GCC CL interface is used instead.  Hence, GCC_P_PLIST is
**	   the main parmlist structure for interfacing with the driver(s).
**	2. The gcacl connection control block (svc_parms->gc_cb) is
**	   different; the one being used in Windows is an ASSOC_IPC
**	   structure.  A gcb (GCA_GCB) is allocated when a session is set
**	   up to use a driver and is linked to from the ASSOC_IPC.  The
**	   gcb then is almost the same across Windows and Unix, allowing
**	   the code below to continue to use a gcb as its primary
**	   structure.
**	3. The Unix BSP I/O interface first issues a "register" on an
**	   fd to see if it is has data ready to send or receive and then
**	   issues the send or receive.  On Windows, the first step is to
**	   issue a send or receive and then get posted with a callback
**	   when the I/O is complete.
**	4. The BSP interface updates the buffer pointer to the end of the
**	   data sent or received.  This is used to calculate the length
**	   of data sent or received. With the GCC CL interface, the buffer
**	   pointer is not changed, so the returned length field must be
**	   used instead.
**	5. The externally-visible gcacl GCreceive, GCsend, GCpurge and
**	   GCdisconnect functions were kept in gcacl.c on Windows since
**	   they are also needed if the pipes protocol (default) is used.
**	   The entry function names in this file were changed from
**	   GCreceive to GCDriverReceive, etc.
**	6. Status codes returned from the network driver (gcc cl) are
**	   remapped to valid gc cl status codes, which are later remapped
**	   (in GCA) to GCA status codes.  Not remapping the driver statuses
**	   causes error message file lookup problems because the converted
**	   GCA status won't be valid (see gc.h and gca.h for valid mappings).
**	   Network driver statuses are in the 0x0001278x range such as
**	   GC_CONNECT_FAIL, GC_SEND_FAIL. etc, which have no equivalent
**	   in the GCA statuses which are in the 0x000C0001-58 range (at
**	   this time).  
**	   FYI: Unix BS statuses (0x0001fexx range) don't get converted
**	   by GCA to GCA statuses AND have corresponding error messages,
**	   so don't experience the same problem.  NOTE that the pipes
**	   code on Windows utilizes the BS_READ_ERR code of 0x0001FE07 
**	   but #defines it with the name NP_IO_FAIL.  This is, to some
**	   extent, a hack since the BS errors are really for the Unix CL
**	   BS implementation.
**
**	The remainder of the comments following this point are from
**	the original (Unix) file.
**
**	Both GCsend() and GCreceive() merely post requests to their
**	respective state machines, GC_send_sm() and GC_receive_sm(),
**	and start the state machines if they are not running.
**	GCpurge() is like GCsend(), but posts a special request to the
**	GC_send_sm() to send two 0 length messages.  
**	
**	The sender and receiver state machines list themselves as the
**	completion routines for their ii_BS calls, and store their
**	state in the GCA_GCB allocated by GClisten() or GCrequest().
**	The state machine is "running" if either the state machine code
**	is active or the state machine name (GC_send_sm() GC_recv_sm())
**	is on the callback of an ii_BS routine.  GCsend() and
**	GCreceive() insure the integrity of state machine data by
**	calling the state machine only if it is not already running.
**	Therefore, there is at most one sender and one receiver state
**	machine running for each connection (or GCA_GCB).
**	
**	We handle normal and expedited data (as indicated by SVC_PARMS'
**	"flags.flow_indicator" flag) as two multiplexed subchannels on
**	the same channel.  The sender gives the "expedited" subchannel
**	higher priority; otherwise we treat these subchannels
**	identically.  To note the subchannel in the byte stream, an
**	MTYP, containing the subchannel number (0 or 1) and the block
**	length, precedes each block of data.
**	
**	GC_send_sm() loops, looking for a) a request to send chop
**	marks, b) a request to send data.  To send chop marks, it makes
**	two calls to ii_BSsend() to send two MTYP's with 0 length data
**	blocks, and then ii_BSflush() flush the channel.  To send data,
**	it calls ii_BSsend(), then ii_BSflush() flush the channel, and
**	then drives the client completion routine.  GC_send_sm()
**	returns when there are no requests.
**	
**	GC_recv_sm() performs the following loop: call ii_BSread() to
**	to read the next incoming MTYP;  determine the subchannel of
**	the incoming data; determine the target client buffer; call
**	ii_BSread() to read the data; drive the client completion
**	routine.  GC_recv_sm() returns when there are no requests to
**	read data.
**	
**	When GC_recv_sm() reads a chop mark (an MTYP block with 0
**	length data) it sets the read request's outstanding receive
**	length to 0, so that it is immediately satisfied, and allows
**	GC_recv_complete() to note that the received data length is not
**	what was requested and to set the SVC_PARMS' "flags.new_chop"
**	flag.
**	
** History:
**	 ... copied from Unix version as of following change:
**	 2-Feb-2010 (hanal04) Bug 123208
**	    In GC_recv_sm() close a security vulnerability by checking
**	    the supplied length is greater than zero.
**      13-Apr-2010 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122679
**	    Created.  Copied from Unix version and then modified for
**	    Windows.  Part of project to add support for net drivers
**	    like "tcp_ip" as local IPC on Windows if II_GC_PROT set.
**	    This file was needed to implement multiplexed sends and
**	    receives of the gcacl channels (normal and expedited) over
**	    a single network connection.  NOTE that prior history
**	    comments from the original gcarw.c file were deleted in
**	    in this section; look at the Unix version if interested.
**	    Removed all "#ifdef OS_THREADS_USED" since Ingres on Windows
**	    is always built for OS threads. Removed listenbcb (N/A on
**	    Windows).
**	    Modified GCTRACE levels for non-error conditions to 3.
**	    Add 2-byte prefix to static GC_chopmarks for use by called
**	    network driver for length prefix...otherwise prior field
**	    in static area is overlaid if called protocol driver is
**	    using streams mode (which it doesn't due to Unix/Linux
**	    direct connect incompatibility, but it "could" and was
**	    successfully tested Windows to Windows).
**	    Don't set new_chop flag if receive unsuccessful.
**      13-Jul-2011 (hanal04) SIR 125458
**          Update cs_elog calls inline with sc0e_putAsFcn changes.

			** had a chance to resume processing in the mainline,
			** which will issue GCA_DISASSOC.  Telling the
			** DBMS about the failed expedited receive before
			** GCA_DISASSOC starts causes very messy disconnects;
			** the DBMS sees it as an interrupt and reissues
			** an expedited GCA_RECEIVE plus other things ending
			** in an internal processing error being attempted
			** to be sent to the client (who is now long gone).
			** Another symptom is that the DBMS usually won't
			** shutdown (ingstop says it did, but dmfacp, dmfrcp,
			** and iidbms are still running).
			** Some attempts were made to fix the DBMS, but were
			** only partially helpful.  GC* servers do not have
			** the same problem.  This problem is unique to
			** Windows and is due to the fact that Windows
			** posts all available async IO completions before
			** returning to exit from WFMOex() {in CSsuspend
			** in particular). So, the completion for both the
			** GCA_RELEASE on normal channel and the failed
			** expedited receive completion (because client
			** closed the socket immediately after sending
			** GCA_RELEASE) occur before DBMS mainline gets
			** control back.  NOTE that deferring the failed
			** completion until later DEPENDS ON a GCdisconnect
			** being issued subsequent to this by the caller.
			** If that doesn't happen, it is conceivable that a
			** hang could occur, since the completion for the
			** failed expedited receive might never be called.
