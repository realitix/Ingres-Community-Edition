/*
** Name: GCCLOCAL.H
** Description:
**	Contains struct typedefs and #defines used locally for GC CL functions
**	needed by the Comm Server.
**
**	See description in gcevnt.c for use of these structures.
** History:
**	03-Nov-93 (edg)
**	    Created for Windows NT.
**	19-Nov-93 (edg)
**	    Added PCB_STATE structure.  Should be included as first member
**	    in a protocol driver's PCB if that protocol driver wishes to
**	    use some of the utility routines.
**	02-dec-93 (edg)
**	    Winsock driver restructuring -- put the event and mutex handles
**	    for the thread's Q's into THREAD_EVENTS.
**	05-dec-93 (edg)
**	    Added GCC_WINSOCK_DRIVER structure.  This structure is now also
**	    a member of THREAD_EVENTS.
**	10-jan-94 (edg)
**	    Added gcc cl internal func refernces and global refs.
**	23-apr-96 (tutto01)
**	    Added definitions and prototypes for DECnet.
**	09-may-1996 (canor01)
**	    Added definitions for GCwinsock_exit() and GClanman_exit().
**	24-jun-1997 (canor01)
**	    Add handle for async i/o thread to THREAD_EVENTS structure.
**	01-jul-97 (somsa01)
**	    Moved DECnet stuff into decnet.c . DECnet is now contained in its
**	    own DLL, and it is loaded in at ingstart time.
**      06-aug-1999 (mcgem01)
**          Replace nat and longnat with i4.
**      03-Apr-2002 (lunbr01) Bug 106589
**          Add pcbInternal_listen & _conn to THREAD_EVENTS for internal socket.
**	01-oct-2003 (somsa01)
**	    Added TCP_IP (Winsock 2.2) functions.
**	20-feb-2004 (somsa01)
**	    Separated listen specific stuff from GCC_WINSOCK_DRIVER into
**	    a new structure, GCC_LSN. This is because, per protocol, there
**	    could be multiple listen ports.
**	28-Aug-2006 (lunbr01) Sir 116548
**	    Add IPv6 support.  Update GCC_LSN structure to add hListenEvent.
**          Change single listen address and socket to array ptrs for
**          Winsock2 ONLY and misc other Winsock2 ONLY fields.
**  13-aug-2009 (zhayu01) SIR 121210
**      Adopted it for Pocket PC 2003/Windows CE.
**      mClient does not use Ingres net and the adoption is
**      to make it compiled.
**	13-Apr-2010 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122679
**	    Remove GLOBALREF's for ex-global WS_DRIVER definitions.
**	    Add thread handle of original requestor to REQUEST_Q structure.
**	    Change return type of protocol driver exits from VOID to STATUS.
**	    WS_DRIVER structure now has all driver exit pointers, not just
**	    init and addr; also added 2 new exits for GCsave/GCrestore.
