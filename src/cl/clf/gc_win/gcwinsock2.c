**  Name: GCWINSOCK2.C
**  Description:
**	The main driver for all protocols that go thru the WinSock 2.2 API.
**	The protocols accessed via the WinSock 2.2 API will all basically
**	use the same set of calls and mechanisms. There are some slight
**	differences between adresses and such which get addressed in
**	specific routines for the protocol.
** 
**  History: 
**	01-oct-2003 (somsa01)
**	    Created.
**	29-jan-2004 (somsa01)
**	    Changed SecureZeroMemory() to ZeroMemory(). SecureZeroMemory()
**	    is only available on Windows Server 2003.
**	09-feb-2004 (somsa01)
**	    Removed extra declaration of GCwinsock2_exit(). Also, in
**	    GCwinsock2_open(), when working with an instance identifier as
**	    a port address, make sure we start with only the first two
**	    characters. The subport is calculated from within the driver's
**	    addr_func() function.
**	20-feb-2004 (somsa01)
**	    Updates to account for multiple listen ports per protocol.
**	08-oct-2004 (somsa01)
**	    In GCwinsock2(), if we're going to queue a completion routine
**	    execution, make sure we return OK from this function. Also, in
**	    GCC_DISCONNECT, make sure the pcb is valid. Also, in
**	    GCwinsock2_worker_thread(), make sure lpPerHandleData is valid
**	    in OP_DISCONNECT.
**      15-Feb-2005 (lunbr01)  Bug 113903, Problem EDJDBC 97
**          Do not clear the 3rd char of the input port when passed in
**          as XX# format.  Some callers, such as the JDBC server, pass in
**          an explicit symbolic port to use.
**      23-feb-2005 (lunbr01)  bug 113686, prob INGNET 160
**          E_GC4810_TL_FSM_STATE errors occur occasionally in GCD due to 
**          SEND (or RECV) completion routine being called AFTER disconnect
**          compl rtn. Add "call completion routine" requests at END of
**          queue rather than beginning to force FIFO processing of
**          completions.  Each occurrence of E_GC4810 results in approx 
**          9K memory leak.
**      29-feb-2005 (lunbr01)  bug 113987, prob INGNET 165
**          Pending async RECEIVES occasionally do not post complete after
**          the socket is closed during disconnect, which resulted in the
**          disconnect looping forever waiting for the IO to complete.
**          Limit the number of times disconnect will wait.  Symptom
**          is that subsequent connect requests may hang.
**      14-jul-2004 (loera01) Bug 114852
**          For GCwinsock2_worker_thread() and GCwinsock2_AIO_Callback(),
**          in the OP_RECV_MSG_LEN operation, fetch the second byte of
**          the message length if only one byte was sent.
**      16-Aug-2005 (loera01) Bug 115050, Problem INGNET 179
**          In GCwinsock2_listen(), don't retrieve the hostname
**          via gethostbyaddr() if the connection is local.  Instead,
**          copy the local hostname from GChostname().
**      26-Jan-2006 (Ralph Loen) Bug 115671
**          Added GCTCPIP_log_rem_host to optionally disable invocation of 
**          gethostbyaddr() in GCwinsock2_listen() and 
**          GCwinsock2_worker_thread().
**      28-Aug-2006 (lunbr01) Sir 116548
**          Add IPv6 support.
**      22-Jan-2007 (lunbr01) Bug 117523
**          Corrupted (invalid) incoming data with large length prefix 
**          can crash caller (eg, GCC or GCD).  Add check to ensure
**          caller's buffer length is not exceeded (ie, avoid buffer overrun).
**      06-Feb-2007 (Ralph Loen) SIR 117590
**          In GCwinsock2_listen_complete(), removed getnameinfo() and set 
**          the node_id field in the GCC listen parms to NULL.
**      03-Aug-2007 (Ralph Loen) SIR 118898
**          Add GCdns_hostname().  In GCwinsock2_init(), moved WSA
**          startup logic into GCwinsock2_startup_WSA(), so that both
**          GCdns_hostname() and GCwinsock2_init() could check and startup
**          WSA. 
**      11-Oct-2007 (rajus01) Bug 118003; SD issue: 116789
**	    When DAS server is mistakenly configured to use same
**	    integer or alpha numeric ports for both flavors of tcp_ip
**	    protocols (tcp_ip & wintcp) the driver loops while trying to
**	    bind to a unique port causing DAS server to go into loop
**	    upon a new JDBC connection filling the errlog.log with
**	    E_GC4810_TL_FSM_STATE error message until the disk
**	    becomes full.
**      11-Sep-2008 (lunbr01)
**	    Fix compiler warning in LISTEN CreateThread (NULL -> 0).
**	    Add Trace (level=1) statements for error conditions that don't
**	    already have them plus enhance/standardize format.
**	    This will simplify diagnosis of problems in this driver.
**	    Change socket displays (traces) from %d to %p since on Windows
**	    they are UINT_PTR and will be 64-bits long on 64-bit systems;
**	    hence, changes display of socket id from decimal to hex.
**	26-Nov-2008 (Bruce Lunsford) Bug 121285
**	    Redo disconnect logic: issue closesocket() earlier and perform
**	    sleep loop waiting for async I/O to complete on the socket
**	    in a dedicated disconnect thread (for all sessions) rather
**	    than a winsock worker thread for each session, which can tie
**	    up all the worker threads preventing I/O to post complete.
**	    Accvio can then occur after disconnect "gives up" after 1
**	    second, frees pcb and other control blocks that pending receive
**	    tries to access when it runs.
**	    Also prevent occasional crash in tracing after WSARecv()s.
**	02-Mar-2009 (Bruce Lunsford) Bug 121742
**	    Fix crashes while connecting on Windows 2000 (and Win 9x/ME).
**	    Also connections handled by routine "normal_connect" were 
**	    failing with error=0 when tracing is on.  Other hangs would
**	    occur with tracing on, which was resolved by ensuring
**	    GCTRACE not called in between function and WSAGetLastError()
**	    ...because GCTRACE overlays the last error (with zero).
**	06-Aug-2009 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122426
**	    Various performance enhancements and associated fixes:
**	    1. Convert GCC completion queue mutex to a critical section
**	    to improve performance (less overhead).
**	    2. Add support for alertable IO (AIO):
**	       ...use if II_WINSOCK2_CONCURRENT_THREADS environment variable
**	       ...    or winsock2_concurrent_threads config.dat variable
**	       ...       is set to zero.
**	    Alertable IO (rather than current default of IO Completion
**	    Port) may provide better performance for single-threaded GC*
**	    servers by avoiding extra thread context switching for all IO
**	    completions. On the other hand, performance may be worsened
**	    on some multi-CPU machines because other CPU processors will,
**	    for the most part, not be utilized.
**	    3. New variables (concurrent & worker threads) also allow
**	    overriding defaults for IO Completion Port # of concurrent
**	    and worker threads.
**	    4. If using IO completion port, add 1 less extra thread than
**	    we used to for the listens since it is not needed.
**	    5. Call completion routine directly (for performance) rather
**	    than "scheduling" it whenever running in caller's thread.
**	    6. Modify receive logic (modeled after Unix gccbs.c) to do a
**	    single receive instead of 2 per request (previously recv'd
**	    2-byte length prefix and then recv'd the actual data).
**	    Added variable II_WINSOCK2_RECV_BUFFER_SIZE and config.dat
**	    winsock2_recv_buffer_size; if not set, defaults to 
**	    RCV_PCB_BUFF_SZ (#define in PCB...8 or 32K most likely).
**	    If set to zero, no overflow area allocated and the old
**	    approach of 2 WSARecv()'s per GCC_RECEIVE will be used.
**	    Code was extracted to new function GCwinsock2_OP_RECV_complete()
**	    and is shared by AIO and worker thread logic.
**	    7. Sync up code in GCwinsock2_AIO_callback() with code in
**	    GCwinsock2_worker_thread() so that common code can be shared,
**	    such as new receive function.
**	    8. Collapse PER_HANDLE_DATA into PCB; it's small and there
**	    is no need to allocate and free it separately...complicates
**	    code unnecessarily.  Its info belongs in the PCB.  However,
**	    GetQueuedCompletionStatus() requires the address of a 
**	    completion key (which was the pointer to the PER_HANDLE_DATA)
**	    so just made it a local dummy field.
**	    9. Check for presence of lpOverlapped from IO completions in 
**	    worker threads...may be NULL under certain error conditions.
**	    10. Convert CreateThread() to _beginthreadex() which is
**	    recommended by Microsoft when using C runtime. This also
**	    involves using errno instead of GetLastError() for failures.
**	    Add logic to terminate and close the Disconnect Thread (missing
**	    from fix for bug 121285).
**	    11. Add async connect logic for AIO using Events.
**  13-aug-2009 (zhayu01) SIR 121210
**      Adopted it for Pocket PC 2003/Windows CE.
**      mClient does not use Ingres net and the adoption is
**      to make it compiled.
**	28-Oct-2009 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122814
**	    Added variable II_WINSOCK2_NODELAY and config.dat winsock2_nodelay.
**	    If set to "ON", socket option TCP_NODELAY is set on all
**	    connections.  This "may" improve performance as it disables
**	    the TCP Naegle algorithm, which can cause delays of up to 200
**	    milliseconds between sends.  Unix/Linux already sets this option
**	    except on OS-threaded inbound sessions (ie, in DBMS).
**	19-Nov-2009 (Bruce Lunsford) Bug 122940 + Sir 122426
**	    Failed connects and listens were not detected when using
**	    recently added async alertable I/O logic (item 11 above for
**	    sir 122426).  Added WSAGetOverlappedResult() and WSAGetLastError()
**	    when connect/listen completed to check results.  This required
**	    adding the socket to associated AIO structures.
**	17-Dec-2009 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122536
**	    Add support for long identifiers. Use cl-defined GC_HOSTNAME_MAX
**	    instead of gl-defined GCC_L_NODE in GCdns_hostname().
**	13-Apr-2010 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122679
**	    Add support for net drivers like "tcp_ip" as local IPC.
**	    Variable name of protocol-specific init_func was changed to
**	    prot_init_func. In GCwinsock2_exit(), get dcb from input parm
**	    PCT entry rather than calling GCwinsock2_get_thread(); since
**	    GCwinsock2_get_thread() is no longer used, removed it.
**	    Remove calls to WSAGetLastError() after getaddrinfo() failure
**	    as it returns a zero (0) status, which is confusing.  Just use
**	    the return value directly from getaddrinfo(); also add call to
**	    gai_strerror() to get message text for error during GCC_OPEN.
**	    Support port zero (0) listens for local IPC.
**
**	    Embed one PER_IO_DATA structure for both send and receive
**	    into the PCB.  This eliminates the overhead of allocating and
**	    freeing them for each send and receive request.  For some
**	    situations, such as immediate returns that skip subsequent
**	    callback, the single embedded PER_IO_DATA is insufficient,
**	    so additional ones are allocated as needed.  Allocation is
**	    now done in new function GCwinsock2_get_piod.  Deallocation
**	    is handled by GCwinsock2_rel_piod.
**
**	    If an error occurs on a request immediately, rather than
**	    scheduling a callback to the caller's completion routine
**	    and returning OK, instead just return FAIL thereby allowing
**	    the caller to detect the error right away.
**
**	    Change default mechanism for scheduling completion requests
**	    to one that supports a multithreaded environment; doesn't
**	    affect Alertable IO (AIO) sends/receives because they call
**	    completion routine directly since they always run in the
**	    caller's thread.  The old completion scheduling mechanism
**	    was fairly high overhead (EnterCritSect, alloc memory, add
**	    entry to completion Q, LeaveCritSect, set event ... and the
**	    reverse on the receiving (caller's) side).  If multiple threads
**	    were waiting on a callback, the old mechanism had no way to
**	    ensure that the correct thread woke up from the event posting.
**	    Use Windows QueueUserAPC functionality to replace it; much
**	    simpler, may improve performance, and can target completions
**	    to the correct thread.  Provide config variable
**	    II_WINSOCK2_EVENT_Q (=ON) to resort back to original mechanism.
**
**	    Set system_status to ER_close if send or receive failed due to
**	    connection having been closed (BytesTransferred == 0).
**
**	    Shutdown function GCwinsock2_exit() now returns STATUS rather
**	    than VOID since caller expects it.
**	    Occasional crash in iigcc shutdown that was more common with
**	    II_GC_PROT=tcp_ip was resolved by adding a short sleep after
**	    each pending listen socket is closed to allow waiting worker
**	    thread to process before freeing associated resources.
**
**	    To improve turnaround time and support peeks (receives with
**	    zero timeout values), if PCT option PCT_SKIP_CALLBK_IF_DONE
**	    is set, then caller supports getting results immediately (if
**	    request has completed) rather than waiting to get results when
**	    the completion exit is called back, which then won't be done.
**	    Similar for sends.  Currently, only GCA CL (gcarw.c) can handle
**	    immediate results with no callback.
**
**	    Add support for timeouts on receives.  Timeouts are required for
**	    calls from GCA CL in selected circumstances.  Most receives have
**	    no timeout (timeout=-1 for INFINITE) and is not even used on
**	    calls from GCC TL.  A new field, timeout, was added to the end
**	    of the input parmlist.  For backward compatibility
**	    to GCC TL, which doesn't pass a timeout value in the parm_list,
**	    only check timeout if PCE option PCT_ENABLE_TIMEOUTS is on.
**	    Unfortunately, Winsock2 async receives provide no mechanism for
**	    timing them out or cancelling them (except by closing the socket,
**	    which shuts down the whole connection).  The only timeout options
**	    that winsock provides, such as setsockopt(SO_RCVTIMEO) only work
**	    with sync calls.  Even WSACancelBlockingCall() only works for
**	    sync(blocking) calls and is not supported in winsock2.
**	    For performance, switching to sync/blocking calls is not viable
**	    without spinning them off to separate threads.  Another option
**	    is to use select(), which DOES have a timeout value, but this
**	    would defeat the whole purpose of the switch to winsock2 to use
**	    a common wait mechanism (WaitForMultipleObjects) throughout
**	    Ingres central wait points (wintcp uses winsock1 with select(),
**	    tcp_ip uses winsock2 with WaitFor...Objects).  Due to lack of
**	    native winsock2 timeout support, a "smoke and mirrors" scheme
**	    was used.  Receives with timeouts are issued in the normal way
**	    but are directed to receive into an internal work/overflow
**	    buffer area. If the timeout period is reached before the
**	    receive completes, the caller's completion routine is called
**	    with GC_TIME_OUT error.  In the meantime, if a new receive
**	    comes in, the pending receive to the OS is redirected to the
**	    new receive request; it is too late to change the target area
**	    or length of the receive which is why it was initially
**	    directed to the internal overflow area.  When the IO completes,
**	    the data is copied from the overflow buffer to the requester's
**	    receive buffer.  There is a new state field in the PER_IO_DATA
**	    structure used to keep track of the receive flow since there
**	    are a number of event sequences that can occur and have
**	    slightly different actions/results.  One special case is
**	    receives with timeout=0, which is essentially a "peek".
**	    The immediate return logic is used in this case and no
**	    timer needs to be set.  However, the IO callback still occurs
**	    and must be handled in a manner similar to "timeout > 0" cases.
**	    Windows "waitable timer" object is used to handle the timer
**	    duties. When the timer expires and the thread becomes "alertable",
**	    the OS calls the completion routine associated with the timer,
**	    GCwinsock2_Timer_Callback(), which then cleans up and calls
**	    the GCC_RECEIVE request completion routine.
**
**	    Change default size of receive overflow buffer from #defined
**	    value (=32768) to the packet size in the protocol table (PCT).
**	    Change default IO processing mode from IO completion port to
**	    alertable IO (AIO), which generally performs better and is
**	    supported for tcp_ip as local IPC.
**
**	    Added "id" to pcb and traced it; modeled after gcb->id in
**	    gcarw.c.  This simplifies analyzing traces.
**	    Change PCB typedef to PCB2 so that Windows debugger will
**	    pick it up properly; the one in iilmgnbi.c was being picked
**	    up instead.
**
**	    Add 2 new external functions, GCwinsock2_save() and
**	    GCwinsock2_restore() to support GCsave() and GCrestore()
**	    (and are called by those routines).  These functions are
**	    only used when running under GCA CL (ie, as local IPC).
**	14-Jun-2010 (Bruce Lunsford) Bug 123954
**	    Trace showed bogus value (often very large) for # of bytes
**	    gotten after reissuing WSARecv() following receipt of a
**	    partial message.  Fixed by initializing dwBytes to zero.
**	    Also add explanatory traces when required to reissue recv.
**	23-Jun-2010 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 123953
**	    Change default for TCP_NODELAY socket option from OFF to ON
**	    since it improves response time in some cases, but never
**	    seems to hurt response time.  Also add new Ingres config
**	    names to enable or disable it, which are more "intuitive"
**	    than the old names, while keeping the old (for now) for
**	    backward compatibility (even though never documented).
**	    New names: II_TCPIP_NODELAY    and !.tcp_ip.nodelay.
**	    Old names: II_WINSOCK2_NODELAY and !.winsock2_nodelay.
**	16-Aug-2010 (Bruce Lunsford) Bug 124263
**	    Ingstart.exe may crash or take (up to 30 seconds) longer than it
**	    should to start Ingres if II_GC_PROT=tcp_ip (from sir 122679).
**	    (Re)set GCwinsock2_shutting_down to FALSE in GCwinsock2_init()
**	    to handle applications that may call "init" and "term" multiple
**	    times, such as ingstart with II_GC_PROT=tcp_ip.
**	30-Aug-2010 (Bruce Lunsford) Bug 124325
**	    Function closesocket(), which is issued during disconnect,
**	    does not always disconnect "gracefully", causing messages
**	    to occasionally be dropped that have been sent but not yet
**	    received by the other side. This can result in hung sessions
**	    or connection abort errorlog messages in Ingres servers.
**	    Fixed by calling DisconnectEx() prior to closesocket();
**	    this forces "graceful" disconnect, rather than relying
**	    on implicit graceful disconnect, which doesn't always work.
**	08-Sep-2010 (Bruce Lunsford) Bug 124389
**	    Last fix (for bug 124325) caused a regression for shared
**	    (GCsave/restore'd) sockets when II_GC_PROT=tcp_ip.  The
**	    new call to DisconnectEx() disconnected "too well", making
**	    the shared socket unusable by the other process.  Example
**	    is that createdb would fail.  Fix is to not issue
**	    DisconnectEx() for shared sockets.  Added shared_socket_flag
**	    in PCB to track if socket is shared.  Also added check of
**	    return code from closesocket() in GCC_DISCONNECT with tracing
**	    to improve diagnostics.
**      13-Jul-2011 (hanal04) SIR 125458
**          Update cs_elog calls inline with sc0e_putAsFcn changes.

/*
**  Name: GCwinsock2_init
**  Description:
**	WinSock 2.2 inititialization function. This routine is called from
**	GCpinit() -- the routine GCC calls to initialize protocol drivers.
**
**	This function does initialization specific to the protocol:
**	    Initialize tracing variables
**	    Creates I/O completion port for the protocol (non-Windows 9x)
**	    Create worker threads for the I/O completion port (non-Windows 9x)
**	    Load WinSock extension functions (non-Windows 9x)
**
**  History:
**	01-oct-2003 (somsa01)
**	    Created.
**      28-Aug-2006 (lunbr01) 
**          Cannot call WSAGetLastError() if WSAStartup() fails, as with
**          other Windows Sockets calls, because WS2_32.DLL will not have
**          been loaded.
**      03-Aug-2007 (Ralph Loen) SIR 118898
**          Moved WSA startup logic into GCwinsock2_startup_WSA(), so that both
**          GCdns_hostname() and GCwinsock2_init() could check and startup
**          WSA.
**	11-Sep-2008 (lunbr01)
**	    Check/setup trace variable sooner to get more tracing out.
**	26-Nov-2008 (Bruce Lunsford) Bug 121285
**	    Add initialization of objects for disconnect thread.
**	06-Aug-2009 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122426
**	    Read thread variable to determine if using IO Completion Port
**	    or Alertable IO for async IO.
**	    Convert CreateThread() to _beginthreadex() which is recommended
**	    when using C runtime.
**	28-Oct-2009 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122814
**	    Added variable II_WINSOCK2_NODELAY and config.dat winsock2_nodelay.
**	    and set corresponding static variable GCWINSOCK2_nodelay
**	    accordingly.
**	13-Apr-2010 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122679
**	    Now that this driver can be used for local communications
**	    as well as remote (via GCx server), only do the initialization
**	    on the first time in.  WSAStartup_called field is now
**	    a "use count" rather than a true/false boolean.
**	    Locate QueueuUserAPC() for new thread-aware callback mechanism
**	    and provide config variable II_WINSOCK2_EVENT_Q (=ON) to
**	    resort back to original queue/GCC_COMPLETE event mechanism.
**	    Change default size of receive overflow buffer from #defined
**	    value (=32768) to the packet size in the protocol table (PCT).
**	    The #define value is now only used if PCT packet size is not
**	    greater than 0.  This reduces wasted memory in the case where
**	    the overflow was much bigger than the PCT packet size, without
**	    impacting performance (receive size is set to minimum of
**	    the 2 sizes, which now default to being equal).
**	    Change default IO processing from IO Completion Port to
**	    Alertable IO (AIO), which provides slightly better performance
**	    in most environments and is currently the only supported
**	    option for tcp_ip as a local (GCA CL) protocol (instead of
**	    pipes.  IO Completion Port logic can be enabled by setting
**	    II_WINSOCK2_CONCURRENT_THREADS to a non-zero numeric value.
**	23-Jun-2010 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 123953
**	    Change default for TCP_NODELAY socket option from OFF to ON
**	    since it improves response time in some cases, but never
**	    seems to hurt response time.  Also add new Ingres config
**	    names to enable or disable it, which are more "intuitive"
**	    than the old names, while keeping the old (for now) for
**	    backward compatibility (even though never documented).
**	    New names: II_TCPIP_NODELAY    and !.tcp_ip.nodelay.
**	    Old names: II_WINSOCK2_NODELAY and !.winsock2_nodelay.
**	16-Aug-2010 (Bruce Lunsford) Bug 124263
**	    (Re)set GCwinsock2_shutting_down to FALSE to handle
**	    applications that may call "init" and "term" multiple
**	    times, such as ingstart with II_GC_PROT=tcp_ip.
**	    Otherwise, after 2nd or subsequent "init", code still
**	    thinks the driver is shutting down.
**	30-Aug-2010 (Bruce Lunsford) Bug 124325
**	    Get address of Winsock extension function DisconnectEx().

/*
**  Name: GCwinsock2
**  Description:
**	Main entry point for the WinSock 2.2 protocol driver. This
** 	driver is essentially just a dispatcher -- it runs in the primary
**	GCC thread and mostly just allows the I/O completion port to handle
**	aynchronous operations (Windows NT platforms) or completion routines
**	to handle asynchronous operations (Windows 9x). It may also start a
**	listen thread if it is a LISTEN request.
**
**	The following functions are handled:
**	    GCC_OPEN	- call GCwinsock2_open
**	    GCC_LISTEN  - post a listen using GCwinsock2_listen
**	    GCC_CONNECT - satisfy a synch / asynch connect request
**	    GCC_SEND    - satisfy an asynch send request
**	    GCC_RECEIVE - satisfy an asynch recieve request
**	    GCC_DISCONN - satisfy an asynch disconnect request
**
**  History:
**	16-oct-2003 (somsa01)
**	    Created.
**	20-feb-2004 (somsa01)
**	    Updated to account for multiple listen ports per protocol.
**	08-oct-2004 (somsa01)
**	    If we're going to queue a completion routine execution, make
**	    sure we return OK from this function. Also, in GCC_DISCONNECT,
**	    make sure the pcb is valid.
**      27-feb-2005 (lunbr01)
**          Fix trace stmts following WSASend and WSARecv by initializing
**          dwBytes to 0 and correcting descriptions on WSASend trace.
**      11-Sep-2008 (lunbr01)
**          Fix compiler warning in LISTEN CreateThread (NULL -> 0).
**          Add trace statements for all error conditions.
**	26-Nov-2008 (Bruce Lunsford) Bug 121285
**	    Redo disconnect logic:
**	    1. Issue closesocket() earlier--here in GCC_DISCONNECT in main 
**	       thread rather than in IO completion routine OP_DISCONNECT
**	       in worker thread.
**	    2. Only invoke background disconnect logic if there is 
**	       currently I/O to wait on.
**	    3. Interface to background disconnect logic has changed.
**	       Previously did a PostQueuedCompletionStatus() call to
**	       OP_DISCONNECT operation type, which would get assigned
**	       to one of the worker threads.  Now, we queue a request
**	       and signal a dedicated disconnect thread.
**	    Call new standalone function GCwinsock2_schedule_completion
**	    instead of having code inline.
**	    Prevent occasional crash in tracing after WSARecv() by not
**	    referencing fields in control blocks that may be gone due
**	    to async I/O completing first on other (worker) threads.
**	02-Mar-2009 (Bruce Lunsford) Bug 121742
**	    Fix crash while connecting on Windows 2000 (and Win 9x/ME).
**	    Allocate lpPerHandleData for non-W9x systems even if
**	    lpfnConnectEx() doesn't exist (as on W2000).
**	    Ensure GCTRACE() not invoked between winsock calls
**	    and WSAGetLastError() because it overlays the returned
**	    status (such as WSAEWOULDBLOCK) with zero, which can cause
**	    hangs if tracing is on.  Also means no longer need to check 
**	    for status!=OK with SOCKET_ERROR.
**	06-Aug-2009 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122426
**	    Handle both AIO and IO Completion Port logic for SENDs and
**	    RECVs, including setup for 1-step or 2-step RECVs.
**	    Convert CreateThread() to _beginthreadex() which is recommended
**	    when using C runtime.
**	    Add async connect logic for AIO using Events.
**	13-Apr-2010 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122679
**	    Don't call WSAGetLastError() after getaddrinfo() failure as it
**	    returns a zero (0) status, which is confusing.  Just use the
**	    return value directly from getaddrinfo().
**
**	    Create new functions GCwinsock2_get_pcb() and ...rel_pcb()
**	    to handle allocating/initializing and releasing/freeing a PCB,
**	    respectively.
**	    PER_IO_DATA structures for send and receive are now embedded
**	    in the PCB and no longer need to be allocated and freed for
**	    each send/receive request.
**
**	    If caller supports it, when an operation completes immediately,
**	    return with the results and skip the subsequent callback to the
**	    completion routine; this condition is indicated by returning
**	    status=FAIL but generic_status=OK. Support for this feature
**	    by the caller is indicated with flag PCT_SKIP_CALLBK_IF_DONE
**	    being set in the PCE pce_options field.  Currently the feature
**	    is used by GCA CL to support "peeks" (receives with timeout=0)
**	    and to improve performance.
**
**	    Add support for timeouts on receives. For backward compatibility
**	    to GCC TL which doesn't pass a timeout value in the parm_list,
**	    only check timeout if PCE option PCT_ENABLE_TIMEOUTS is on.
**	30-Aug-2010 (Bruce Lunsford) Bug 124325
**	    In GCC_DISCONNECT, precede closesocket() call with a
**	    DisconnectEx() call to force a graceful disconnect, rather
**	    than relying on closesocket()'s implicit graceful disconnect,
**	    which doesn't always work. Sent messages were occasionally
**	    being dropped.
**	08-Sep-2010 (Bruce Lunsford) Bug 124389
**	    Last fix (for bug 124325) caused a regression for shared
**	    (GCsave/restore'd) sockets when II_GC_PROT=tcp_ip.  The
**	    new call to DisconnectEx() disconnected "too well", making
**	    the shared socket unusable by the other process.  Example
**	    is that createdb would fail.  Fix is to not issue
**	    DisconnectEx() for shared sockets.  Also added check of
**	    return code from closesocket() with tracing to improve
**	    diagnostics.

/*
**  Name: GCwinsock2_open
**  Description:
**	Open the listen socket for WinSock 2.2. Called from GCwinsock2(). This
**	routine should only be called once at server startup.
**
**  History:
**	16-oct-2003 (somsa01)
**	    Created.
**	09-feb-2004 (somsa01)
**	    When working with an instance identifier as a port address, make
**	    sure we start with only the first two characters. The subport is
**	    calculated from within the driver's addr_func() function.
**	20-feb-2004 (somsa01)
**	    Updated to account for multiple listen ports per protocol.
**      15-Feb-2005 (lunbr01)  Bug 113903, Problem EDJDBC 97
**          Do not clear the 3rd char of the input port when passed in
**          as XX# format.  Some callers, such as the JDBC server, pass in
**          an explicit symbolic port to use.
**      28-Aug-2006 (lunbr01) Sir 116548
**          Add IPv6 support.  Add call to getaddrinfo() to get list of
**          IP addresses that we should listen on--may be an IPv4 &
**          0-n IPv6 addresses.
**      11-Sep-2008 (lunbr01)
**          Add trace statements for all error conditions.
**	02-Mar-2009 (Bruce Lunsford) Bug 121742
**	    Make IO completion port usage (and hence worker threads)
**	    dependent on existence of GCwinsock2CompletionPort rather 
**	    than OS version.
**      06-Aug-2009 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122426
**	    Call GetLastError() instead of WSAGetLastError() after calling
**	    CreateEvent() and other non-winsock related functions.
**	    If using IO completion port, add 1 less extra thread
**	    than we used to for the listens since it is not needed.
**	    Also, add = to ck against MAX_WORKER_THREADS.
**	    Convert CreateThread() to _beginthreadex() which is recommended
**	    when using C runtime.
**	13-Apr-2010 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122679
**	    Don't call WSAGetLastError() after getaddrinfo() failure as it
**	    returns a zero (0) status, which is confusing.  Just use the
**	    return value directly from getaddrinfo().  Also add call to
**	    gai_strerror() to get message text for error.
**	    Port will be zero (0) for local IPC listens; this will cause
**	    the bind to return an available non-zero port.  Grab the one
**	    assigned to the 1st address info entry returned by getaddrinfo()
**	    and then use it for any subsequent address info entries (if any).
**	    Also, the generated port must be returned to the caller rather
**	    than zero as the port number.

/*
**  Name: GCwinsock2_disconnect_thread
**  Description:
**	This routine is started as a separate background thread which
**	handles disconnects that have asyncronous I/O (receives and sends) 
**	pending.  The disconnects are put on a queue by the mainline
**	thread and then an event set to wake up this thread.  This
**	function will check each session's pending I/O count and
**	when it drops to zero, post the completion routine for the
**	disconnect request.  After all the pending disconnects have
**	been checked, if any still have pending I/O and there are no
**	new disconnects to process from the input queue, the thread
**	thread goes into a short sleep to allow more I/O to complete
**	and then starts the cycle all over again.  The thread does
**	not terminate until the process terminates.
**
**	There is a point at which we "give up" waiting for the
**	I/Os to complete and go ahead and schedule the disconnect
**	completion.  This is intended to prevent the possibility
**	of orphan sessions in the disconnect Q hanging around
**	indefinitely and tying up sessions in the GC* server.
**	See NOTE below related to DISCONNECT_ASYNC_WAITS_MAX_LOOPS.
**
**  History:
**	26-Nov-2008 (Bruce Lunsford) Bug 121285

**	obtains an available event for caller from an array of events.
**	The returned event can be used in the ConnectEx() or AcceptEx()

**
**	In the hopefully rare occurrence that no events are available

**	Queue the new event until a slot in the wait array frees up.

**  Inputs:

**
**  Outputs:

**	Static array for event-related overlapped pointers is updated
**	     with caller's lpOverlapped value, indicating event is

**  Name: GCwinsock_wait_completed_connect
**  Description:
**	For AIO logic (ie, not IO Completion Ports), asynchronous
**	connects are handled via events.  This routine waits for any
**	connection event (one per pending connect and listen request)
**	to be signaled by the OS (from original ConnectEx() or
**	AcceptEx() call); the event is signalled when the request
**	is complete.  This routine determines which connect/listen
**	request has completed and passes back to the caller
**	a pointer to the Overlapped area, from which the address
**	to even more useful info in the PerIoData structure can
**	be obtained.
**
**	This routine is called from a special worker thread for
**	connects in lieu of GetQueuedCompletionStatus().  This
**	allows sharing of the worker thread code that handles
**	connects.  If using the AIO logic for sends and receives,
**	ConnectEx() and AcceptEx() are used for async connects.
**	However, since these functions only work with IO Completion
**	Ports or Events, the latter must be used since AIO and
**	IO Completion Port logic on a socket is mutually exclusive.
**	That is, one cannot use an IO Completion Port to connect and
**	then use AIO for sends and receives (the OS complains).
**
**  Inputs:
**      &lpOverlapped   Pointer to location where pointer to overlapped
**			structure is to be returned.
**
**  Outputs:
**      lpOverlapped    Pointer to overlapped structure.  Set to NULL
**			if none found.
**	status		Pointer to status from completed connect/listen.
**
**  Returns:
**       TRUE	if found a completed connect/listen request.
**	 FALSE	if error (such as abandoned WAIT)

**  History:
**	29-oct-2003 (somsa01)
**	    Created.
**      14-jul-2004 (loera01) Bug 114852
**          In the OP_RECV_MSG_LEN operation, fetch the second byte of
**          the message length if only one byte was sent.
**      11-Sep-2008 (lunbr01)
**          Add trace statements for all error conditions.
**	26-Nov-2008 (Bruce Lunsford) Bug 121285
**	    Call new standalone function GCwinsock2_schedule_completion
**	    instead of having code inline.
**	02-Mar-2009 (Bruce Lunsford) Bug 121742
**	    Ensure GCTRACE() not invoked between OS or winsock calls
**	    and [WSA]GetLastError() because tracing overlays the returned
**	    status (such as WSAEWOULDBLOCK) with zero.
**	06-Aug-2009 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122426
**	    Move check for disconnect (zero bytes received) above (rather
**	    than after) check for "not all bytes received" to fix loop
**	    continually WSARecv'ing 0 bytes (occurred at disconnect).
**	    Call completion routine directly (for performance) rather
**	    than "scheduling" it.
**	    Sync up code here with code in GCwinsock2_worker_thread()
**	    so that we can share code, where feasible. Replaced OP_RECV
**	    and OP_RECV_MSG_LEN code with single call to new shared code
**	    GCwinsock2_OP_RECV_complete(), which handles both 1-step and
**	    2-step receives.
**	13-Apr-2010 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122679
**	    Add trace to exit and a blank line before entry and after exit
**	    for easier tracking of IO completion processing in trace output.
**	30-Aug-2010 (Bruce Lunsford) Bug 124325
**	    Add trace when caller's callback routine was already called
**	    and I/O callback is hence just a NO-OP...to improve trace diags.

/*
**  Name: GCwinsock2_schedule_completion
**  Description:
**	Schedule callback of the completion routine for the request.
**	This is an alternative to calling the completion routine
**	directly.  It must be used when the thread that is handling
**	the completion is different from the thread that originated
**	the request; the completion routine is required to be invoked
**	from the thread of the original request.
**
**	Two(2) options are supported:
**	1. Queue a UserAPC to the target thread's and invoke the
**	   completion routine from there.
**	2. (Legacy) Queue a request element to the GCC completion
**	   queue (global) and set event to trigger routine in main
**	   thread to run the completion routine.  This only works
**	   reliably for GC* servers which are single-threaded and
**	   only wait on the completion queue event from the main
**	   thread.  This option has no thread awareness, which would
**	   be needed in any multi-threaded environment, like the DBMS.
**	   Another drawback of this approach over option 1 is the
**	   extra overhead since this option involves acquiring and
**	   releasing a sync object, setting an event, ...all system
**	   functions.  One potential advantage is that the completion
**	   routine will be invoked from the requester thread in a
**	   "normal" thread context whereas, with option 1, the
**	   completion routine is invoked in a UserAPC callback mode.
**
**	The following are scenarios that must call this function:
**        1. Completion Port IO, which runs in worker threads.
**        2. Alertable IO async connects and listens, which run in worker
**	     threads.
**	  3. Disconnects that had been queued to the disconnect thread
**	     awaiting completion of all pending IOs.
**
**  Inputs:
**	One and only one of the following inputs should be provided.
**	Supply the rq if one already exists, else one will be built
**	from the parm list:
**      rq_in      	Ptr to request queue entry.
**			If NULL, one will be created if needed.
**      parm_list_in	Ptr to function parm list.
**			If NULL, rq_in required and must contain parm list
**			in rq_in->plist.
**			If not NULL, and if rq_in is not NULL, then
**			parm_list_in should match rq_in->plist (not verified).
**	ThreadId_in	Thread id of original requestor.
**			If NULL, get from rq_in if present, else use current
**			thread.
**
**  Outputs: none
**
**  Returns:
**	OK if successful
**	FAIL or Windows status if unsuccessful (unable to schedule callback)
**
**  History:
**	26-Nov-2008 (Bruce Lunsford) Bug 121285
**	    Split out into standalone function since code is now needed
**	    in 5 places.
**	13-Apr-2010 (Bruce Lunsford) Sir 122679
**	    Use QueueUserAPC() to queue completions to the target thread
**	    instead of prior mechanism, which allocated memory for request,
**	    queued it to global completion Q (synchronized) and set
**	    GCC_COMPLETE event.  New mechanism is thread-aware and simpler--
**	    probably faster as well.  Add target thread to input parm list;
**	    ThreadId_in takes precedence, but if not specified there, then
**	    use the one in the rq_in.  If zero, then get a handle to the
**	    current thread.

**  Name: GCwinsock2_OP_RECV_complete
**  Description:
**	This is a shared RECEIVE completion routine for asynchronous I/O

**	It has 2 modes of operation:  
**	1. 2-step receive:
**	   First, a receive for just the 2-byte message length prefix is
**	   done, followed by a receive for the rest of the message.
**	   This is the original mode (but new code) used by this driver.
**	   Used if a receive overflow buffer was not allocated, which is 
**	   controlled by setting config parm winsock2_recv_buffer_size
**	   or Ingres variable II_WINSOCK2_RECV_BUFFER_SIZE to zero.
**	2. 1-step receive:
**	   A receive is done for the full message, including the length
**	   prefix, based on the available space in the receive and overflow
**	   buffers.  If more than the one message is received, then the
**	   excess is copied to the receive overflow buffer to await the
**	   next GCC_RECEIVE request.
**	   This is the newer, default mode used by this driver and is
**	   modeled after the Unix implementation.  It "should" provide
**	   better performance as the # of RECV requests issued to the OS
**	   is cut approximately in half.
**
**  Inputs:
**      dwError         Error indicator received by callback mechanism

**  Name: GCdns_hostname()
**
**  Description:
**
**      GCdns_hostname() -- get fully-qualified host name
**
**      This function differs from GChostname() and PMhost() in that it
**      fetches the true, fully qualified network name of the local host--
**      provided that such a name exists.  If a fully qualified network
**      name cannot be found, an empty string is returned.  If a fully 
**      qualified network name is found, but the output buffer is too 
**      small, the host name is truncated and an error is returned.
**
**  Inputs:
**      hostlen         Byte length of host name buffer.
**      ourhost         Allocated buffer at least "hostlen" in size.
**
**  Outputs:
**      ourhost         Fully qualified host name - null terminated string.
**
**  Returns:
**                      OK
**                      GC_NO_HOST
**                      GC_HOST_TRUNCATED
**                      GC_INVALID_ARGS
