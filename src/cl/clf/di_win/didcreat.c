** Name: DIdircreate - Creates a directory.
**
** Description:
**      The DIdircreate will take a path name and directory name
**      and create a directory in this location.
**
** UNIX design:
**	The creation of directories in the dbms presents a special problem
**	which is further complicated by the ingres protection system and the
**	differences in system V and BSD implementation of routines to create
**	directories.
**
**	The directories that are created by this function are database, journal
**	and ckp directories.  The directory in which they are created is owned
**	by INGRES and has permission 700 (to stop all other users from getting
**	to the directories below).  The ingres process which is running
**	executing this command will be installed as a "setuid" program, so that
**	users running the program will have effective uid INGRES and real uid
**	random_user.
**
**	The current BSD (4.2 and later) mkdir command creates a directory
**	given a full pathname (or relative) correctly in these circumstances.
**
**	However system V does not provide an equivalent functionality.  The
**	mknod() command must be run with effective uid root.  The only other
**	routine to make a directory available is the system level command
**	"mkdir".  The system V mkdir uses access() which runs with the real
**	users permission.  Therefore mkdir fails if given a full pathname
**	with the above stated permission characteristics.   To get around
**	this, in the SV environment, we change our cwd to be the "base"
**	directory in which we want to create the new directory.  We then use
**	the user level "mkdir" to create the new directory.  This requires the
**	real user to have write permission in the "base" directory; therefore
** 	the INGRES protection scheme is changed so that the "base" directories
**	under data, ckp, jnl, etc. are PEworld("rwxrwx").  data, ckp jnl, etc.
**	remain PEworld("rwx--") so the data is still protected (modulo UNIX).
**	When DIcreate() is used to create databases (ckps, jnls) it's now
**	necessary to use PEumask("rwxrxw"), otherwise the REAL user's
**	permissions may preclude ingres from accessing the database (ckp, jnl).
**
**	It should also be noted that the database directories will be owned
**	by the REAL user on SV and "ingres" (the effective user) on BSD42.
**	This is not a change but has been a point of confusion.
**
**
** Inputs:
**      f                    Pointer to file context area.
**      path                 Pointer to the path name.
**      pathlength           Length of path name.
**      dirname              Pointer to the directory name.
**      dirlength            Length of directory name.
** Outputs:
**      err_code             Pointer to a variable used
**                           to return operating system
**                           errors.
**    Returns:
**        OK
**        DI_BADDIR          Path specification error.
**        DI_BADPARAM        Parameter(s) in error.
**        DI_EXCEED_LIMIT    Open file limit exceeded.
**        DI_EXISTS          Already exists.
**        DI_DIRNOTFOUND     Path not found.
**    Exceptions:
**        none
**
** Side Effects:
**        none
**
** History:
**      18-jul-95 (reijo01)
**          Changed SETWIN32ERR so that it will populate the CL_ERR_DESC with
**              the proper values.
**      06-aug-1999 (mcgem01)
**          Replace nat and longnat with i4.
**      13-Jul-2011 (hanal04) SIR 125458
**          Update cs_elog calls inline with sc0e_putAsFcn changes.
