**		PCwait

**	Arguments:

**	Result:
**		wait for specified subprocess to terminate.
**
**		Returns: child's exit status
**				OK		-- success
**				PC_WT_BAD	-- child didn't execute, e.g bad parameters, bad or inacessible date, etc.
**				PC_WT_NONE	-- no children to wait for
**				PC_WT_TERM	-- child we were waiting for returned bad termination status
**
**	Side Effects:
**		None

**	History:

 * Revision 1.2  87/03/14  11:30:39  daveb

**
**		Revision 3.0  85/05/29  12:16:14  wong
**		Corrected WECO code to return correct status
**		depending on status from the child.

**			written
**		06/87	--	(lin & daveb)
**			added a loop for wait() if the pid picked up is not the
**			one we want to wait for. Also changed the proc to the
**			the input pid instead of the original pid address 
**			containing the returned pid.
**	25-may-90 (blaise)
**	    Integrated changes from 61 and ingresug:
**		Add include for <clconfig.h>;
**		Changed include <signal.h> to <clsigs.h>;
**		Silence warnings by using TYPESIG;
**		Put the initial check of the pid queue inside the for(;;) loop -
**		if someone has SIGCHLD trapped, the pid may be added to the
**		queue effectively during the wait().
**	25-mar-91 (kirke)
**	    Added #include <systypes.h> because HP-UX's signal.h includes
**	    sys/types.h.
**	21-may-91 (seng)
**		Add int declaration in front of Pidq_init.
**		RS/6000 compiler chokes on statement.
**	26-apr-1993 (fredv)
**	    Moved <clsigs.h> before <ex.h> to avoid redefine of EXCONTINUE 
**		in the system header sys/context.h of AIX.
**	15-jul-93 (ed)
**	    adding <gl.h> after <compat.h>
**	05-jun-1995 (canor01)
**	    semaphore protect memory allocation routines
**      03-jun-1996 (canor01)
**          New ME for operating-system threads does not need external
**          semaphores. Removed ME_stream_sem.
**	06-oct-1998 (somsa01)
**	    Instead of returning PC_WT_BAD, return the error received from
**	    the child.
**	27-oct-1997 (canor01)
**	    If process completed, but returned a bad status, return that
**	    to the caller.
**	02-dec-1997 (Saeid)
**	    Use waitpid, instead of wait. This allow you to wait for specific
**          child, otherwise problem of concurrency with compileProcedure (Jasmine).
**	17-dec-1997 (canor01)
**	    Synchronize access to global Pidq when using OS threads.
**	19-dec-1997 (Saeid)
**	    Condition wait or waitpid with "xCL_WAITPID_EXISTS", for portability.
**          "xCL_WAITPID_EXISTS" is defined in "clsecrt.h", because right
**	    now, the only UNIX plateform for Jasmine is Solaris. But it
**	    should be implemented in "mksecret.sh".
**	09-oct-1998 (somsa01)
**	    In returning the exit status from the child, wait_status should
**	    be shifted by 8, not by 4.
**      07-jun-2000 (stial01)
**          Removed Pidq_mutex. (b101767, Startrak 9027036)
**      29-Nov-1999 (hanch04)
**          First stage of updating ME calls to use OS memory management.
**          Make sure me.h is included.  Use SIZE_TYPE for lengths.
**      13-Jul-2011 (hanal04) SIR 125458
**          Update cs_elog calls inline with sc0e_putAsFcn changes.
