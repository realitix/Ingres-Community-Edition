/*
 *	Name:	PCspawn.c
 *
 *	Function:
 *		PCspawn
 *
 *	Arguments:
 *		i4		argc;
 *		char		**argv;
 *		bool		wait;
 *		LOCATION	*in_name;
 *		LOCATION	*out_name;
 *		PID		*pid;
 *
 *	Result:
 *		Spawn a subprocess.
 *
 *		create a new process with it's standard input and output 
 *		linked to LOCATION's named by the caller.  Null LOCATIONS 
 *		means use current stdin and stdout.
 *
 *		Returns:
 *			OK		-- success
 *			FAIL		-- general failure
 *			PC_SP_CALL	-- arguments incorrect
 *			PC_SP_EXEC	-- cannot execute command specified, 
 *					   bad magic number
 *			PC_SP_MEM	-- system temporarily out of core or 
 *					   process requires too many 
 *					   segmentation registers.
 *			PC_SP_OWNER	-- must be owner or super-user to 
 *					   execute this command
 *			PC_SP_PATH	-- part of specified path didn't exist
 *			PC_SP_PERM	-- didn't have permission to execute
 *			PC_SP_PROC	-- system process table is temporarily 
 *					   full
 *			PC_SP_REOPEN	-- couldn't associate argument 
 *					   [in, out]_name with std[in, out]
 *			PC_SP_SUCH	-- command doesn't exist
 *
 *	Side Effects:
 *		None
 *
 *	History:
 *		03/83	--	(gb) written
 *		24-aug-87 (boba) -- Changed memory allocation to use MEreqmem.
 *		10-oct-88 (daveb)
 *			reformatted, include clconfig.h, rename PC.h to
 *			pclocal.h.
 *
 *			Eliminate use of BSD define by always checking for
 *			access permision.  We don't really know if we are
 *			using vfork or fork, and it doesn't hurt.
 *
 *			Simplify tortuous ?: operations on reopen.
 *
 *			We have a problem in that we want everyone to use
 *			PCwait for child accounting, but we use MEreqmem,
 *			that some people don't want.  We may need to rethink
 *			whether dynamic allocation is such a good idea.
 *	3-Dec-1988 (daveb)
 *			Bury fork and additions to the pid queue by using
 *			a new internal routing, PCfork(), to be used
 *			throughout the CL.
 *	31-may-89 (daveb)
 *			PCfork takes an argument.  Wasn't providing one.
 *	19-mar-90 (Mike S)
 *		  	Add support for appended output files and redirected
 *			stderr.
**	25-may-90 (blaise)
**	    Integrated changes from 61 and ingresug:
**		Flush the TR buffers to output;
**		Set up the default handler for SIGC(H)LD to keep sub-shells
**		happy.
**	29-may-90 (blaise)
**	    Changed SIGCLD to SIGCHLD. SIGCLD is the sysV equivalent of 
**	    SIGCHLD, and it seems that, while sysV boxes know about
**	    both of these, some bsd boxes do not.
**	25-mar-91 (kirke)
**	    Added #include <systypes.h> because HP-UX's signal.h includes
**	    sys/types.h.
**	15-jul-93 (ed)
**	    adding <gl.h> after <compat.h>
**	12-apr-95 (abowler)
**	    Bug 52338 - renamed setsig to EXsetsig.
**	11-nov-1997 (canor01)
**	    When PC_NO_WAIT is specified, when the spawned process exits,
**	    it will become "defunct", waiting for its parent to reap it.
**	    Instead, fork an intermediate process to be its parent that
**	    will immediately exit. Caller can reap this one.
**	20-nov-1997 (walro03)
**	    Place clconfig.h, clsigs.h, and ex.h in proper order to avoid
**	    compile error redefining EXCONTINUE on AIX.
**      02-sep-1998 (canor01)
**	    Change PCexit() to _exit() when terminating the intermediate
**	    process created in PC_NO_WAIT.  This will prevent it from closing
**	    files held open by the parent.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**      17-Apr-2001 (hweho01)
**          1) In PCdospawn(), Child process also calls PCfork() if the BSD
**              version is used.
**          2) Changed to compare with -1 when perform the error check for   
**             BSD's setpgrp() function.
**	12-Feb-2008 (hanje04)
**	    SIR S119978
**	    Include unistd.h to quite compiler warnings for system functions.
**	15-nov-2010 (stephenb)
**	    Include pccl.h and fix up finction defines for prototyping.
**	1-Dec-2010 (kschendel)
**	    Modernize declaration style for Sun compiler.
