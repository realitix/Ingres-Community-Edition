**	Name:
**		PCsspawn.c
**
**	Function:
**		PCsspawn
**
**	Arguments:
**		i4	argc;
**		char	**argv;
**		bool	wait;
**		PIPE	*c_stdin;	* PIPE pointer (file descriptor) to be
**					  associated with child's stdin *
**		PIPE	*c_stdout;	* PIPE pointer (file descriptor) to be
**					  associated with child's stdout *
**		PID	*pid;		* process id of spawned child *
**
**	Result:
**		Spawn slave subprocess.
**
**		Create a new process with its standard inpout and output linked
**			to file descriptors (c_stdin and c_stdout) supplied by
**			the caller.
**
**		Returns:
**			OK		-- success
**			FAIL		-- general failure
**			PC_SP_CALL	-- arguments incorrect
**			PC_SP_EXEC	-- cannot execute command specified,
**						bad magic number
**			PC_SP_MEM	-- system temporarily out of core or
**						process requires too
**						many segmentation registers.
**			PC_SP_OWNER	-- must be owner or super-user to
**						execute this command
**			PC_SP_PATH	-- part of specified path didn't exist
**			PC_SP_PERM	-- didn't have permission to execute
**			PC_SP_PROC	-- system process table is temporarily
**						full
**			PC_SP_SUCH	-- command doesn't exist
**			PC_SP_CLOSE	-- had trouble closing unused sides of
**						pipe
**			PC_SP_DUP	-- had trouble associating, dup()'ing,
**						the pipes with the child's
**						std[in, out]
**			PC_SP_PIPE	-- couldn't establish communication
**						pipes
**
**	Side Effects:
**		None

**		03/83	--	(gb) written
**		6/12/86 --	(ljm) Bug #9626:  integrate Annie's fix for bug
**				#7822 from 3.0:
*	+(1/28/86 (ac) -- bug # 7822 fix. setuid(geteuid()) after
*	+		fork() but before exec() backend in child's
*	+		process address space. In this way, only
*	+		the real uid of the child process is set
*	+		to its effective uid before spawns backend
*	+		and the frontend program still has its
*	+		original real uid.)
*
*		9/25/86 --	(daveb) Remove the setuid stuff for 
*			7822 and 9626.  This was a botch.  The original
*			problem (accessdb) has long since been fixed by
*			correct methods without the side-effects of setuid.
**			This code was not portable to System V, and was
*			incorrect, causing a segmentation violation on Sun.
*		24-aug-87 (boba) -- Changed memory allocation to use MEreqmem.
*
*		10-oct-88 (daveb)
*			reformatted, include clconfig.h, rename PC.h to
*			pclocal.h.
*
*			Eliminate use of BSD define by always checking for
*			access permision.  We don't really know if we are
*			using vfork or fork, and it doesn't hurt.
*
*	3-Dec-1988 (daveb)
*			Bury fork and queue manipulation in new routine, 
*			PCfork(), to be used throughout the CL.
*	8-may-89 (daveb)
*			Do fd set size with CL_NFILE() macro instead of
*			using _NFILE or getdtablesize directly.
* 	31-may-89 (daveb)
* 			PCfork takes an argument.  We weren't.  Give it one.
**	25-may-90 (blaise)
**	    Integrated changes from 61 and ingresug:
**		Flush the TR buffers to output;
**		Remove EX_NO_FD stuff left over from 5.0.
**	25-mar-91 (kirke)
**	    Added #include <systypes.h> because HP-UX's unistd.h (included
**	    by clnfile.h) includes sys/types.h.
**      05-Nov-1992 (mikem)
**          su4_us5 port.  Changed direct calls to CL_NFILE to calls to new
**          function iiCL_get_fd_table_size().
**	7-Jul-1993 (daveb)
**	    include <clconfig.h> before <pc.h>, so it can correctly
**	    set stuff so we get the right extern for getpid() from
**	    system header files, or wherever.
**	15-jul-93 (ed)
**	    adding <gl.h> after <compat.h>
**	16-aug-93 (ed)
**	    add <st.h>
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	15-nov-2010 (stephenb)
**	    Correctlty define static functions for prototyping.
**	1-Dec-2010 (kschendel)
**	    Modernize declaration style for Sun compiler.
