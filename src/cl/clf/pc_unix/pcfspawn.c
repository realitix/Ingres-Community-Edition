 *	Name:
 *		PCfspawn.c
 *
 *	Function:
 *		PCfspawn
 *
 *	Arguments:
 *		i4	argc;
 *		char	**argv;
 *		bool	wait;			* wait/don't wait for child *
 *		FILE	*c_stdin;		* descriptor for slave's stdin *
 *		FILE	*c_stdout;		* descriptor for slave's stdout *
 *		PID	*pid;			* process id of slave, returned to caller *
 *
 *	Result:
 *		Spawn a slave process.
 *
 *		Create a new process with its standard input and output linked to FILE pointers
 *			supplied by the caller.
 *
 *		Returns:
 *			OK		-- success
 *			FAIL		-- general failure
 *			PC_SP_CALL	-- arguments incorrect
 *			PC_SP_EXEC	-- cannot execute command specified, bad magic number
 *			PC_SP_MEM	-- system temporarily out of core or process requires too
 *						many segmentation registers.
 *			PC_SP_OWNER	-- must be owner or super-user to execute this command
 *			PC_SP_PATH	-- part of specified path didn't exist
 *			PC_SP_PERM	-- didn't have permission to execute
 *			PC_SP_PROC	-- system process table is temporarily full
 *			PC_SP_SUCH	-- command doesn't exist
 *			PC_SP_CLOSE	-- had trouble closing unused sides of pipe
 *			PC_SP_DUP	-- had trouble associating, dup()'ing, the pipes
 *						with the child's std[in, out]
 *			PC_SP_PIPE	-- couldn't establish communication pipes
 *			PC_SP_OPEN	-- had trouble associating child's std[in, out] with passed in FILE pointers
 *
 *	Side Effects:
 *		None
