/* 
**	Function:
**		PCreap_withThisPid -- wait for dead process, usually after SIGCLD.
**
**	Arguments:
**		none.
**
**	Result:
**		Looks to see for a process has died
**
**	Returns:
**		Pid of the process reaped, or -1 if not reaped.
**
**	Side Effects:
**		The status of the reaped process is saved in the Pidqueue,
**		for examination by PCwait.
**
**	History:
**	31-Oct-1988 (daveb)
**		created.
**	26-may-89 (daveb)
**		silence warnings by declaring handles TYPESIG instead of int.
**	25-mar-91 (kirke)
**		Added #include <systypes.h> because HP-UX's signal.h includes
**		sys/types.h.
**	21-mar-91 (seng)
**		wait union struct declared in <sys/m_wait.h> on AIX 3.1.
**	26-apr-1993 (fredv)
**	    Moved <clconfig.h> and <clsigs.h> before <ex.h> to avoid
**		redefine of EXCONTINUE in the system header sys/context.h
**		of AIX.
**	15-jul-93 (ed)
**	    adding <gl.h> after <compat.h>
**      10-feb-95 (chech02)
**          Added rs4_us5 for AIX 4.1.
**      05-jun-1995 (canor01)
**          semaphore protect global Pidq
**	03-jun-1996 (canor01)
**	    remove above semaphore since code is not used multi-threaded.
**	05-Dec-1997 (allmi01)
**	    Added special #defines and #undefs fro sgi_us5 to get he wait
**	    struct to be included from sys/wait.h.
**	10-Dec-1998 (kosma01)
**	    sqs_ptx ran afoul of CA Licensing on a multiprocessor box.
**	    The DBMS server would loop during startup or stop responding later.
**	    The sever was catching a SIGCHLD signal from CA Licensing, but had
**	    only iislaves to wait() for. Changing just PCreap() to use waitpid() 
**	    instead of wait() fixed the failing server on DYNIX/ptx 4.4 but
**	    broke the working server on DYNIX/ptx 4.2. I then stopped CSsigchld()
**	    from reestablishing itself via i_EXsetothersig(), because the OS does
**	    it for sigaction established signal handlers. Someday, a brave soul 
**	    should check if the CSsigchld() change by it self is sufficient, the
**	    waitpid() approach is slow.
**	23-jan-1998 (canor01)
**	    restore the protection on the Pidq.
**	23-Mar-1999 (kosma01)
**	    Remove special #defines and #undefs for sgi_us5, they are no
**	    longer needed to get a clean compile and execution.
**      01-Oct-1999 (linke01)
**          Structure not found in <wait.h> or <sys/wait.h>. Included
**          </usr/ucbinclude/sys/wait.h> for rmx_us5.
**	13-sep-2000 (hayke02)
**	    The sqs_ptx only fix for 94452 (CA licensing problems on
**	    multiprocessor boxes - dmfrcp or iidbms waiting for iislave
**	    to die during ingstart) has been extended to all platforms
**	    (even platforms supporting OS threading can run iislaves
**	    if II_THREAD_TYPE is set to internal). This change fixes
**	    bug 98804, problem INGSRV 892.
**	01-Jan-2000 (bonro01)
**	    Enable (kosma01) change from 10-Dec-1998 for dgi.
**	12-Apr-2000 (hweho01)
**	    Added ris_u64 to the list of platforms that need <sys/m_wait.h>.
**      07-jun-2000 (stial01)
**          Removed Pidq_mutex. (b101767, Startrak 9027036)
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	22-May-2001 (hanje04)
**	    Cleaned up after bad X-integ.
**	24-May-2001 (hanje04)
**	    Extend sqs_ptx inclusion of wait.h to all platforms
**	    to ensure WNOHANG is defined.
**	23-jul-2001 (stephenb)
**	    Add support for i64_aix
**      01-Oct-2002 (hanal04) Bug 108818
**          Do not include wait.h if we have included sys/wait.h
**          This resolves build errors found during mark 2232 update.
**	28-feb-2003 (somsa01)
**	    Do not include wait.h on HP-UX.
**	02-May-2003 (hweho01)
**	    The wait.h is located in include/sys directory on AIX.
**	28-Apr-2005 (hanje04)
**	    wait.h is located in include/sys on Mac OS X.
**	10-Oct-2006 (hanje04)
**	    BUG: 116919
**	    Use wait() macros (WIEXITED, WEXITSTATUS etc.) to determine
**	    the exit status of child processes correctly. This was not
**	    being achieved on Linux and probably other platforms.
**	09-Oct-2006 (hanje04)
**	    BUG: 117445
**	    SD: 113106
**	    Make sure PCreap stores the correct status when a child process
**	    receives a signal. Only if the process has terminated should we
**	    store PC_WT_TERM in sqp->stat. Otherwise, PC_WT_INTR is stored.
**	12-Feb-2006 (hanje04)
**	    BUG: 117445
**	    SD:113106
**	    Remove "if WIFCONTINUED()" case from waitpid loop as it is not
**	    defined in earlier versions of GLIBC. It shouldn't be needed
**	    anyway as waitpid() is called without WCONTINUED, meaning it
**	    should be reported.
**	08-Feb-2008 (hanje04)
**	    SIR S119978
**	    Replace mg5_osx with generic OSX
**      29-Dec-2008 (coomi01) b121587
**          Introduce targetPid parameter. Renamed function from PCreap()
**          to maintain acustomed interface by adding new PCreap() below.
**	22-Jun-2009 (kschendel) SIR 122138
**	    Use any_aix, sparc_sol, any_hpux symbols as needed.
**      13-Jul-2011 (hanal04) SIR 125458
**          Update cs_elog calls inline with sc0e_putAsFcn changes.
