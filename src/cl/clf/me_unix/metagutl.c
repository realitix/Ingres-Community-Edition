/**
** Name:	metagutl.c	- Utility routines for tagged memory.
**
** Description:
**	Background:
**	    At the time this was written, the implementation of
**	    tagged memory was inefficient on frees.  MEtfree was implemented
**	    by traversing the allocated list of memory pointed to by
**	    MElist and freeing each node found that match the tag.
**	    Obviously, this could be a very slow traversal.
**
**	    To speed this up, the implementation of tagged memory was
**	    changed, and this files contains routines that help with the
**	    implementation.
**
**	Implementation:
**	    The new implementation of tagged memory uses a hash table to
**	    store chains of the allocated blocks.  Each tag has its own
**          chain of allocated blocks so that freeing a table only
**	    requires finding the chain and then freeing each node on
**	    the chain.
**
**	Defines:
**		IIME_atAddTag	A new block of allocated memory for a tag.
**
**		IIME_ftFreeTag	Free all the memory allocated for a tag.
**
** History:
**	5-dec-1989 (Joe)
**	    First Written
**	20-nov-92 (pearl)
**		Add #ifdef for "CL_BUILD_WITH_PROTOS" and prototyped function
**		headers.
**      08-feb-1993 (pearl)
**          Add #include of me.h.
**      8-jun-93 (ed)
**              changed to use CL_PROTOTYPED
**	15-jul-93 (ed)
**	    adding <gl.h> after <compat.h>
**	11-aug-93 (ed)
**	    unconditional prototypes
**      15-may-1995 (thoro01)
**          Added NO_OPTIM hp8_us5 to file.
**      19-jun-1995 (hanch04)
**          remove NO_OPTIM, installed HP patch PHSS_5504 for c89
**      30-May-96 (stial01)
**          New advice ME_TUXEDO_ALLOC should behave like ME_INGRES_ALLOC
**      03-jun-1996 (canor01)
**          Add synchronization and make MEstatus local to make ME
**          stream allocator thread-safe when used with operating-system
**          threads.
**	12-feb-1997 (canor01)
**	    Initialize local MEstatus in IIME_ftFreeTag().
**	29-may-1997 (canor01)
**	    Clean up some compiler warnings.
**      22-apr-1999 (fanra01)
**          Made free list static as there is a name conflict when loaded from
**          Netscape enterprise server.
**      29-Nov-1999 (hanch04)
**          First stage of updating ME calls to use OS memory management.
**          Make sure me.h is included.  Use SIZE_TYPE for lengths.
**      15-nov-2010 (stephenb)
**          wrap IIME_purify_tag_exit in ifdef xPURITY.
**      13-Jul-2011 (hanal04) SIR 125458
**          Update cs_elog calls inline with sc0e_putAsFcn changes.

** Name:	METAGNODE	- The elements of the hash table chains.
**
** Description:
**	Each bucket of the tagged memory hash table contains a linked
**	list of the chains of allocated memory for the tags that hash
**	to the bucket.  This structure implements the node of the linked
**	list.
**
**	met_list is the head of the chain of allocated blocks.  This is
**	a QUEUE, and is used exactly like the MElist variable, which
**	holds the blocks of memory allocated under tag 0.  As with MElist
**	the blocks contained in this QUEUE are ME_NODEs.
**	An important point here is that since the allocated blocks are
**	on a QUEUE just like MElist, MEfree works correctly when freeing
**	a block of tagged memory.  This does mean that a METAGNODE can
**	contain an empty queue.
**
**	met_tag is the tag for which this node contains the chain of
**	allocated blocks.
**
**	met_hash is the pointer to the next METAGNODE in the hash chain
**	of which this node is a part.
