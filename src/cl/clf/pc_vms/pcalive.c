** Name: PCis_alive	    - Is this process still alive?
**
** Description:
**	This function can be called to determine whether a given process is
**	alive or not.
**
** Inputs:
**	pid		    Process to check
**
** Outputs:
**	none
**
** Returns:
**	TRUE		    Process appears to be alive. We also return TRUE if
**			    we can't tell whether the process is alive because
**			    a system problem keeps us from finding out.
**	FALSE		    Process is definitely NOT alive
**
** History:
**	3-jun-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Created
**	21-jun-1993 (bryanp)
**	    I'm not sure if this is documented anywhere, but sys$getjpiw seems
**	    to do something really weird when 'pid' is 0. If 'pid' is zero,
**	    the system call assumes that you want to know the state of your
**	    own process (as though you didn't already know this?) and does the
**	    following: (1) sets 'pid' to your own process's process ID, and
**	    (2) returns SS$_NORMAL, and (3) fills in the process state of your
**	    own process. This is not useful, since it causes us to return "true"
**	    when called to ask if process 0 is alive, but process 0 is in fact
**	    NOT alive, and does not exist. To fix this, I've added code to
**	    handle process 0 as a special case (ugh!).
**      16-jul-93 (ed)
**	    added gl.h
**	3-jan-1993 (bryanp)
**	    ALPHA-specific: event flag 0 appears to be "dangerous". We don't
**	    really understand why, but using event flag 0 in the sys$getjpiw
**	    call causes intermittent "hangs" in ALPHA DBMS servers. To work
**	    around this, we use a non-zero event flag which we get from
**	    lib$getef.
**	19-jul-2000 (kinte01)
**	   Correct prototype definitions by adding missing includes
**	01-dec-2000	(kinte01)
**	    Bug 103393 - removed nat, longnat, u_nat, & u_longnat
**	    from VMS CL as the use is no longer allowed
**	26-oct-2001 (kinte01)
**	   Clean up compiler warnings
**	29-aug-2003 (abbjo03)
**	    Changes to use VMS headers provided by HP.
**	09-oct-2008 (stegr01/joea)
**	    Replace II_VMS_ITEM_LIST_3 by ILE3.
**	28-oct-2008 (joea)
**	    Use EFN$C_ENF and IOSB when calling a synchronous system service.
