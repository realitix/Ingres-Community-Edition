 *	Result:
 *		wait for specified subprocess to terminate.
 *
 *		Returns: child's exit status
 *				OK		-- success
 *				PC_WT_BAD	-- child didn't execute, e.g bad parameters, bad or inacessible date, etc.
 *				PC_WT_NONE	-- no children to wait for
 *				PC_WT_TERM	-- child we were waiting for returned bad termination status

**      16-jul-93 (ed)
**	    added gl.h
**      18-jun-98 (kinte01)
**          return status PCstatus
**      01-oct-98 (chash01)
**          we should wait on proc (or pid) instead of eventflg for that
**          if multiple subprocesses are spawned, they all share the same
**          event flag.  Any one subprocess terminates will set the eventflg
**          permanently, thus gives the false sense that all subprocesses
**          have terminated.  What we should do is to wiat for a period
**          (1 sec) then call PCis_alive to verify the termination of the
**          subprocess.  Also change argument from *proc to proc.  My search
**          indicates that PCwait() arg is a pid value, not an address.
**	19-jul-2000 (kinte01)
**	   Correct prototype definitions by adding missing includes
**	27-jul-2004 (abbjo03)
**	    Rename pc.h to pclocal.h to avoid conflict with CL hdr!hdr file.
