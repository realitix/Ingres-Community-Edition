** LOexist -- Does location exist?
**
**		NOTE:
**		  	access() runs as the real UID rather than the
**			effective UID.  This screws up ingres when it
**			tries to see if ~ingres/data/default exists.
**			data is owned by ingres with permission 700.
**			to get around this a call to stat is made instead.
**
**		returns: OK, FAIL

**		Revision 3.0  85/05/12  00:28:32  wong
**		Removed include of "<sys/types.h>" (already included
**		by "compat.h").
**
**	02/23/89 (daveb, seng)
**		rename LO.h to lolocal.h
**	28-Feb-1989 (fredv)
**		include <systypes.h>.
**	23-may-90 (blaise)
**	    Integrated changes from ingresug:
**		Add "include <clconfig.h>".
**		
**	15-jul-93 (ed)
**	    adding <gl.h> after <compat.h>
**	28-feb-2000 (somsa01)
**	    Use stat64() when LARGEFILE64 is defined.
**	11-May-2001 (jenjo02)
**	    Return appropriate error if stat() fails rather than just
**	    "FAIL" so that LO users can distinguish between "does not exist"
**	    and problems with permissions.
