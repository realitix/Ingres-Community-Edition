** LOlist -- List Contents of Directory
**
**	LOlist will return  the next file or directory in the passed in
**	location.  The initial call gets the first file -- subsequent calls
**	return successive locations.   LOlist will return OK as long as there
**	was a file to return.  If one wishes to stop retrieving locations
**	before the end call LOendlist.
**
**	Parameters:
**
**		inputloc: pointer to location from which to search for files.
**		outputloc:pointer to location where retrieved location is stored.
**		flag: returns ISDIR if location returned is a directory.
**		      returns ISFILE if location returned is a file.
**
**	Returns:
**		LOlist returns OK as long as there was another file 
**		to be found.
**
**	Called by:
**
**	Side Effects:
**		First call opens a file pointer associated with the inputed
**		locations directory file.  Subsequent calls use this file 
**		pointer to get the next location.
**
**	Trace flags:
**
**	Error Returns:
**		Returns non zero on error.
**
**	History:
**
**		4/1/83  -- (mmm) written
**		7/20/83 -- (fhc) changed to work with unix 4.1c
**		2/23/89 -- (daveb, seng) rename LO.h to lolocal.h
**				  moved dir.h to hdr/diracc.h
**                         	  so we can share directory routines with di.
**		28-Feb-1989 (fredv)
**			Include <systypes.h>.
**			Added ifdef xCL_025_DIRENT_EXISTS to select the right
**				directory structure.
**	23-may-90 (blaise)
**	    Integrated changes from 61 and ingresug:
**		Remove code to null-terminate d_name, readdir already does this;
**		Remove EX_NO_FD stuff leftover from 5.0.
**	24-may-90 (blaise)
**	    Removed line of code which null-terminates d_name (missed in the
**	    above change).
**
**	NOTE - this routine is actually obsolete, and FE use of same
**		should be replaced with LOwcard / LOwnext / LOwend
**	15-jul-93 (ed)
**	    adding <gl.h> after <compat.h>
**	23-may-95 (tutto01)
**	    Changed readdir call to the reentrant iiCLreaddir.
**	03-jun-1996 (canor01)
**	    Made readdir_buf into a structure aligned for struct dirent
**	    to avoid alignment problems when used with reentrant readdir.
**	28-feb-2000 (somsa01)
**	    Use stat64() when LARGEFILE64 is defined.
