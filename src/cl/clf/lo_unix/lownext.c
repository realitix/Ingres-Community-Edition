** LOwnext -- Get next file in directory
**
**	LOwnext will return the next file in a directory opened by LOwcard
**
**	Parameters:
**		lc - the context block containing open directory pointer /
**			pattern match information
**
**	Outputs:
**		loc - next file
**
**		Returns:
**			OK if file found
**			ENDFILE if no more files
**			or FAIL.
**
**	Called by:
**		ABF
**
**	Side Effects:
**
**	History:
**
**		3/87 (bobm)	written
**		02/23/89 (daveb, seng)	rename LO.h to lolocal.h
**				moved dir.h to hdr/diracc.h
**                         	so we can share directory routines with di.
**		28-Feb-1989 (fredv)
**			Include <systypes.h>.
**	23-may-90 (blaise)
**	    Integrated changes from 61 and ingresug::
**		Remove code to null-terminate d_name, readdir already does this.
**	sept. 90 (bobm) - fix reassignment of '.' in wildcard check.
**	21-may-92 (dave)
**	    Don't pass back "." and "..".
**	27-may-92 (andys)
**	    Look at each thing we return to determine if it is a file or a
**	    directory and use the appropriate call to LOfroms. This is 
**	    necessary because other LO functions such as LOdelete use 
**	    the existence of fname to determine whether they are dealing 
**	    with a file or directory. This information is filled in by 
**	    the LOfroms call depending on the flags we pass here.
**	06-aug-92 (andys)
**	    Use STequal instead of STcompare as per DaveB suggestion.
**	15-jul-93 (ed)
**	    adding <gl.h> after <compat.h>
**      23-may-95 (tutto01)
**          Changed readdir call to the reentrant iiCLreaddir.
**	03-jun-1996 (canor01)
**	    Made readdir_buf into a structure aligned for struct dirent
**	    to avoid alignment problems when used with reentrant readdir.
**	24-apr-1997 (canor01)
**	    If the suffix is NULL and file is found with no suffix,
**	    we still need to check the prefix for a match.
**	    Previously it was matching any file with no suffix.
**      21-apr-1999 (hanch04)
**        Replace STrindex with STrchr
**	28-feb-2000 (somsa01)
**	    Use stat64() if LARGEFILE64 is defined.
