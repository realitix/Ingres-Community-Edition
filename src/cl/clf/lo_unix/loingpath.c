** Name: LOingpath()	- Build INGRES path 
**
** Description:
**
**      Concatenate "area", "dbname" and "what" to form the "fullpath"
**      location of the database (ckp, dmp, work or jnl) specified.
**      
**      This routine is used to find the locations containing database,
**      checkpoint, dump, work and journal files.  It performs all the
**      remapping implied by system symbols and by the RODV (relation on
**      different volumes) mechanism.
**      
**      The "area" argument is a system dependent string that is stored in
**      the iidbdb.  (The interpretation will differ on various systems because 
**	of inconsistent directory structures.)  The string has a maximum length 
**	of DB_MAXNAME characters. This restriction is imposed by client code
**      client code and the iidatabase catalog, not by LO.  
**      
**      The "dbname" argument is just a string of the database name, again
**	limited to DB_MAXNAME.
**      
**      Standard values for the "what" argument are supplied in LO.h:
**      
**          LO_DB, LO_CKP, LO_DMP, LO_JNL, LO_WORK
**      
**      referring to the database, checkpoint, journal, and work directories
**      respectively.  Only these symbolic constants should be used to identify
**      these directories.  The values of the constants may be system dependent.
** 
**      The "fullpath" argument is the address of a LOCATION that will be
**      filled in with the resolved path.
**      
**	LOingpath() expands the "II_DATABASE", "II_CHECKPOINT", "II_DUMP",
**	"II_WORK", and "II_JOURNAL" symbols (determined by the "what" string)
**	into the destination location in a system dependent manner.  The
**	II_DATABASE etc. symbols are used to locate databases (checkpoints or
**	journals).  These release symbols must be defined in 6.0 or an error
**	will result (previous releases defaulted to the same location as the
**	installation.) These symbols are independent of the ``areas'' used by
**	the RODV mechanism.
**
**	As mentioned above, the interpretation of the "area" argument varies
**      because of the different directory structures in use.  The nature of the
**      constructed location on the current systems is described below.
**      
**      On VMS, "area" is presumed to be the name of a device, and is
**      usually a logical.  The concatenation takes the form
**      "area::path:dbname" where path looks like "[ingres.what]".
**      The routine ensures that devices names are legal (all caps, etc.).
**	No mapping of II_DATABASE is required, since it is mapped by the system
**	when files are opened.
**      
**      CMS emulates the VMS directory scheme and symbol mechanism.
**      No II_DATABASE mapping is needed.
**      
**      On UNIX the concatenation takes the forms described below.
**      It is complicated by the baroque nature of the INGRES/UNIX directory 
**	structure.  In particular, "area" has three radically different 
**	interpretations.
**      
**      1.  If the "area" is a rooted path
**      (limited to DB_MAXNAME characters, as noted above),
**      it is expanded as "/area/ingres/what/default".
**      The "/ingres/" level must be present.
**      
**      2.  If the "area" is one of "II_DATABASE", "II_CHECKPOINT", "II_WORK", 
**	"II_DUMP" or "II_JOURNAL" then it interpreted as a special case and uses
**	the ingres NM routines to determine the symbol value for the area name.
**	This area name is used in the iidbdb to specify the default database,
**	journal, work, or checkpoint area to be used; and that the default 
**	area is determined by one of the appropriate environment variables 
**	"II_DATABASE", "II_CHECKPOINT", "II_DUMP", "II_WORK", or "II_JOURNAL".
**	Note that on unix these symbols are case sensitive (ie. if "ii_system"
**	is passed in as an area the unix LOingpath() routine will interpret it
**	as case #3 described below).
**
**	The symbol must be defined as a rooted path with the same
**	characteristics as case 1.  If the default location for databases is
**	to be /db_disk, then the value of II_DATABASE must be "/db_disk". 
**	The area in this case is expanded to "/db_disk/ingres/data/default".
**      The "/ingres/" level must be present.
**
**	3. If the "area" is not a rooted path or one of the special symbols
**	then the concatenation takes the form "XXX/ingres/what/area".  "XXX" is
**	resolved as follows:  If the "what" requested is one of LO_DB, LO_CKP,
**	LO_DMP, LO_WORK, LO_JNL then NM is used to look up the value of the
**	appropriate symbol for the "what" requested (e.g. "II_DATABASE" when
**	"what" is "LO_DB") and it is used as the "XXX" base; it is an error in
**	this case if the appropriate symbol is not set.  If the "what"
**	requested is not one of LO_DB, LO_CKP, LO_DMP, LO_WORK, LO_JNL then the
**	value of II_SYSTEM is used as "XXX".
**
**      By setting the "area" in the iidbdb, the user may place databases
**      (ckp, journal, dump or work) on separate volumes.
**      By mounting the volume at the same level as the ``default''
**      ones in the default database, journal, and checkpoint locations -
**	{$II_DATABASE,$II_CHECKPOINT,$II_JOURNAL}/ingres/{data,ckp,jnl}/default
**      relative ``areas'' are used.
**      Alternatively, full paths can be used for
**      the ``area'' by building a separate INGRES directory hierarchy
**      (including an "/ingres/" level) on another filesystem, as long as
**      the ``area'' name is less than DB_MAXNAME characters in length.
**      
**      Because UNIX does not have the system level symbol mapping of VMS,
**      II_DATABASE etc. must be expanded when the "fullpath" location is
**      created, rather than deferred to the operating system.  The variables
**      must resolve to a full UNIX directory path.
**      II_DATABASE may be used to work around the arbitrary DB_MAXNAME 
**	character limit on "area" names.
**
**	RAW area implications:
**
**	    Raw location are identified by the existence of a specially
**	    named file, "iirawdevice" (aka LO_RAW), occuring in the 
**	    <area>/ingres/data/default directory.
**
**	    Note that the default data location II_DATABASE can never
**	    map to a raw device, and that only "data" locations
**	    can be defined to raw devices.
**
** Inputs:
**	area				"device" that the database is on
**	dbname				ingres database name
**	what				path to db, ckp or jnl
**	fullpath			set to full path of database.
**	
** Outputs:
**	none.
**
** History:
**	06-27-86 (daveb)
**	    Add support for DB_INGRES, CKP_INGRES and JNL_INGRES,
**      28-jul-88 (mmm)
**          New comments, new coding standards, fix support of relative
**	    alternate areas in default db, jnl, ckp locations.
**	08-aug-89 (greg)
**	    Add support for LO_DMP.
**	07-nov-92 (jrb)
**	    Add support for LO_WORK.
**      19-dec-94 (sarjo01) from 30-aug-94 (nick)
**          fix bug 64457 - LOingpath() trashes slash when passed '/'
**	03-jun-1996 (canor01)
**	    When using operating-system threads, use a different static 
**	    buffer for each thread.
**	18-oct-96 (mcgem01)
**	    Remove hard-coded references to the 'ingres' directory.
**	25-Mar-2001 (jenjo02)
**	    Added RAW location support.
**	10-May-2001 (jenjo02)
**	    Redid RAW location detection. Use normal location
**	    path, but look for special raw filename.
**	17-Oct-2001 (jenjo02)
**	    Can't return fname=LO_RAW, which exposes non-portable
**	    LOCATION structure to generic code.
**	    Now, to detect RAW location, caller must signal intent
**	    by passing "LO_RAW" in "dbname". The RAW test is then 
**	    performed and "LO_IS_RAW" returned in status if true.
**	    Pushed test for RAW vs LO_DB up to DMF.
**	15-Jun-2004 (schka24)
**	    Watch out for buffer overrun.
