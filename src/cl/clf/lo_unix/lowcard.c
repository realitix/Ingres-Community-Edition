** LOwcard -- List Contents of Directory
**
**	LOwcard will open a directory for subsequent LOwnext operations.
**	The directory search has limited wildcarding capabilities, partitioning
**	the name in the same manner as LOdetail.
**
**	Parameters:
**		dirloc	directory location.
**		prefix	desired prefix, or NULL to wildcard.
**		suffix	desired suffix (extension), or NULL to wildcard.
**		version	desired version, ignored because UNIX has no versions.
**
**	Outputs:
**		lc - the context block containing open directory pointer /
**			pattern match information for subsequent LOwnext calls.
**
**		Returns:
**			OK if directory opened.
**
**	Called by:
**		ABF
**
**	Side Effects:
**		Opens a directory file.
**
**	History:
**
**		3/87 (bobm)	written
**		2/23/89 (daveb, seng) 	rename LO.h to lolocal.h
**				moved dir.h to hdr/diracc.h
**                              so we can share directory routines with di.
**		28-Feb-1989 (fredv)
**			Include <systypes.h>.
**		Sept-17-90 (bobm)
**			Make return first file, as per spec.
**	15-jul-93 (ed)
**	    adding <gl.h> after <compat.h>
