 *	Name:
 *		UTedit.c
 *
 *	Function:
 *	 	UTedit
 *
 *	Arguments:
 *		LOCATION	*editor;		* name of editor to spawn *
 *		LOCATION	*filename;		* name of file to edit    *
 *
 *	Result:
 *		edit the file 'filename' with 'editor'.  If 'editor' is
 *		NULL or can't be found the default editor is spawned.
 *		The default is ING_EDIT if it exists. If it doesn't then
 *		EDIT is used.
 *
 *		If the editor is "+EDT", "+TPU", or "+LSE" we'd like to 
 *		call the editor (EDT, TPU, or LSE respectively) in a VMS 
 *		shared image, rather than in a subprocess.  This simple goal 
 *		has compilcations, which are handled in the code below.
 *
 *		1.	TPUSHR has been incompatible between VMS versions.
 *			To avoid incorporating this version-incompatibility
 *			into COMPATLIB, we map TPUSHR at run time, rather
 *			than linking it in.  We handle a mapping failure,
 *			even though it should never happen.
 *		2.	Both callable EDT and callable TPU signal errors
 *			like "invalid file name" instead of handling
 *			them and returning an error status.  Thus the
 *			code in UTedcall.mar, to establish a condition handler
 *			and unwind back to UTedit on any error.  We don't
 *			expect the front ends to generate invalid file names,
 *			but we don't want to kill the process if one should.
 *		3.	Once callable EDT signals an error, it will refuse
 *			to run again, so we will use the subprocess.
 *		4.	LIB$FIND_IMAGE_SYMBOL is one of those helpful VMS
 *			routines which signals as well as returns errors;
 *			so we call it via a MACRO cover which "handles" all
 *			conditions.
 *		
 *	Side Effects:
 *		Obviously 'filename' can be changed.
 *
 *	History:
 *		03/83 -- (gb)
 *			written
 *		10/10/83 (dd) -- VMS CL
 *		5/18/89 (Mike S) -- Use subroutine calls where possible.
 *		08-mar-90 (sylviap)
 *            		Added parameters to PCcmdline.
 *              14-mar-90 (sylviap)
 *                      Passing a CL_RR_DESC to PCcmdline.
 *
**      16-jul-93 (ed)
**	    added gl.h
**	22-sep-93 (ricka)
**	    added st.h, should have been submitted prior to the 20-sep integ.
