**	Name:
**		UTprint.c
**
**	Function:
**		UTprint
**
**	Arguments:
**              char            *printer_cmd;   * printer command to use *
**              LOCATION        *filename;      * name of file to print  *
**              bool            delete;         * TRUE if file to be deleted *
**              i4             copies;         * number of copies to print *
**              char            *title;         * job name/title of output *
**              char            *destination;   * destination printer *
**
**      Result:
**              Print 'n copies' of the file 'filename' with
**                      'printer_cmd'.  If 'printer_cmd' is NULL, use the
**                      default one.  Send the output to 'destination' if set.
**                      Use 'title' as the jobname if set.  If 'delete' is TRUE,**                      delete the file after spooling it.
**
**              Assumes the calling program has check if ING_PRINT is set by
**                      using NMgtAt.  If set, then pass to UTprint as the
**                      first parameter, printer_cmd.
**
**      Side Effects:
**              'filename' will be deleted if 'delete' is TRUE.
**
**
**	HISTORY
**		Modified 8/3/84 (jrc)   Added the delete parameter.
**              08-aug-89 (sylviap)
**             		Changed the parameters, and added new functionality to
**                        print number of copies and to a destination.
**                      Took out check for ING_PRINT.  Calling routines now 
**			  have to check if ING_PRINT is set.
**		13-feb-90 (sylviap)
**			Added parameter to PCcmdline.
**		14-mar-90 (sylviap)
**			Passing a CL_ERR_DESC to PCcmdline.
**		26-apr-90 (jim) on behalf of sylviap
**			Added /noidentify to the print command to the msg
**			will not cause frame to scroll up (#21137)
**		04-mar-91 (sylviap)
**			Changed UTprint so no errors are sent to the screen -
**			   messing up the forms system. #32101
**		15-mar-91 (steveh) fixed bug 35781 by appending a trailing
**			`.' when a print file has no suffix.  Also added
**			required include of st.h.
**		6/91 (Mike S) Use PCcmdnoout to accomplish 04-mar-91 change
**      16-jul-93 (ed)
**	    added gl.h
**	01-dec-2000	(kinte01)
**	    Bug 103393 - removed nat, longnat, u_nat, & u_longnat
**	    from VMS CL as the use is no longer allowed
