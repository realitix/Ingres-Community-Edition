/*
**	The wording of the following copyright message is critical.
**	Please don't play around with it without getting advice from
**	the legal department.
**
**	The string may be too long to compile on most systems.  I made
**	it into one string instead of several, because otherwise the
**	linker could spread it out all over the executable image.  We want
**	the notice to be readable from a dump of the executable.  I'm not
**	sure how to deal with this for compilers that don't allow long
**	strings.
**
**	Also, some compilers may not allow backslash continuations of
**	quoted strings.  Again, I did it this way so it could all be in
**	on string.
**
**	The copyright notice variable is defined as a pointer instead of
**	an array.  This forces the actual notices to become string constants.
**	VMS links these constants at the beginning of the executable file.
**	The closer the notice is to the beginning of the file, the better.
**	On UNIX this doesn't matter, but I left it the same anyway to avoid
**	confusion.
**
**	The latter date in the copyright message should be the date of
**	last major revision.
