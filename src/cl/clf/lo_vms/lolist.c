/*LOlist
**
**	LOlist will return  the next file or directory in the passed in
**	location.  The initial call gets the first file -- subsequent calls
**	return successive locations.   LOlist will return OK as long as there
**	was a file to return.  If one wishes to stop retrieving locations
**	before the end call LOendlist.
**
**	Parameters:
**
**		inputloc: pointer to location from which to search for files.
**		outputloc:pointer to location where retrieved location is stored.
**
**	Returns:
**		LOlist returns OK as long as there was another file to be found.
**
**	Called by:
**
**	Side Effects:
**		First call opens a file pointer associated with the inputed
**		locations directory file.  Subsequent calls use this file pointer
**		to get the next location.
**
**	Trace flags:
**
**	Error Returns:
**		Returns non zero on error.
