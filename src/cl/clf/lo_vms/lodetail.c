 *	Name:
 *		LOdetail
 *
 *	Function:
 *		Returns various and sundry parts of a location in string
 *		form.
 *
 *	Arguments:
 *		loc:	a pointer to the location in question
 *		dev:	a pointer to a buffer where the device name will be stored
 *			NULL on UNIX.
 *		path:	a pointer to a buffer where the path will be stored
 *		fprefix:a pointer to a buffer where the part of a filename
 *			before the dot will be stored.
 *		fsufix: a pointer to a buffer where the part of a filename
 *			after the dot will be stored.
 *		version:a pointer to a buffer where the version will be stored.
 *			NULL on UNIX.
 *
 *	Result:
 *		stores the results in the given buffers.  Buffers should
 *		be of large enough size to hold the results.

 *	Side Effects:

 *	History:
