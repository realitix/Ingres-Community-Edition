/*LOuniq
**
**	Make unique location. It just appends process id for now.
**
**	The string pat is prepended to a alphanumeric pattern guaranteed
**	(with respect to other calls of LOuniq) to be unique.  The re-
**	sulting filename is located in directory path.  The file is not created.

**			03/09/83 -- (mmm)
**				written
**			09/22/83 -- (dd) VMS CL
**			1/17/86 -- (ac) bug # 4660. STpolycat expect a null
**					terminate string. Changed the data type 
**					of templetter from char to *char and 
**					its data from 'A' to "A".
**			23-sep-1987 (Joe)
**				Increased the size of the buffer 'string'
**				to 6 since it holds the decimal ascii version
**				of a  4 digit hex number.  Since the maximum
**				4 digit hex number (0xffff) is 65535, the old
**				buffer size of 5 was 1 too short.  Also, changed
**				the a STcopy to a STlcopy since the STcopy was
**				done and then a check was made for an overrun.
**	06-jan-89 (greg)
**		Integrated MGW's fix for PID required for VMS 5.0
**			22-sep-88 (mgw) Bug #15658
**				CL SPEC says that pat is prepended to a 6
**				character alpha numeric guaranteed to be
**				unique... This fix guarantees that.
**	11/05/92 (dkh) - Changed templetter to point to a real buffer instead
**			 a string literal so that  updates to it won't cause
**			 an AV on alpha.
**				
**      16-jul-93 (ed)
**	    added gl.h
**      11-aug-93 (ed)
**          added missing includes
**	24-may-95 (albany)
**	    Removed unused function declarations; they were causing build
**	    failures with prototyping turned on.
