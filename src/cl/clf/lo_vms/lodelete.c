/*LOdelete
**
**  	Delete a location.
**
**	The file or directory specified by loc is destroyed if possible.
**
**	success:  LOdelete deletes the file or directory and returns-OK.
**		  WARNING -- when LOdelete is given a directory it deletes the
**		  contents of the directory, and then tries to delete the
**		  directory itself.  This will fail if the directory contains
**		  subdirectories.
**	failure:  LOdelete doesn't delete the file, or can't delete the whole
**		  directory.
**		  LOdelete returns NO_PERM if the process does not have
**		  permissions to delete the given file or directory.  LOdelete
**		  returns NO_SUCH if part of the path, the file, or the direc-
**		  tory does not exist.  LOdelete returns CANT_TELL if some other
**		  situation comes up, including not being able to delete some
**		  file in the directory.
