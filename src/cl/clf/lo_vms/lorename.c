/*LOrename
**
**	LOrename changes the name of the file specified by "old_loc" to
**	that specified by "new_loc"
**
**	Parameters:
**		old_loc		location of file 
**		new_loc		location containing new name for the file
**
**	Side Effects:
**		The directories which hold and will hold the files will be
**		modified.
**
**	History:
**		Written for VMS CL 9/26/83 (dd)
**		10/89 (Mike S)  Explicit check for directory rename.
**
**      16-jul-93 (ed)
**	    added gl.h
**	19-jul-2000 (kinte01)
**	   Correct prototype definitions by adding missing includes
**	01-dec-2000	(kinte01)
**	    Bug 103393 - removed nat, longnat, u_nat, & u_longnat
**	    from VMS CL as the use is no longer allowed
