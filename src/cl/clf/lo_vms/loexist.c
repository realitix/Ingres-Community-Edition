**			25-jun-84 (fhc) -- fixed problem where vms/rms/... holds
**				network object channel if sys$parse is not called
**				to clear out the link.  may sometimes cause problems
**				on non-network IO_ACCESS calls as well.
**			4/19/89 (Mike S) Use LOparse and LOclean_fab
**			10/89 (Mike S) Rewrite in terms of LOinfo
