/*{
** Name:	STbcompare() -	Prefix/Case-less Compare of Two Strings.
**
** Description:
**	Compare two strings lexically.  If either length argument is non-zero,
**	only examine the strings up to a minimum prefix of either string.  (The
**	prefix should be the minimum of the length arguments and the lengths
**	of the strings.)  If both of the length arguments are zero, the strings
**	must agree in length before being equal.
**
**	Depending on the setting of argument 'nocase', case is significant in
**	the comparison.  Sense of test is a?b.
**
**	Note:  So that this routine can be efficiently implemented on all
**	architectures (using `nat's,) the maximum length of either string
**	should be no more than MAXI2 bytes each for portability.  This is
**	enforced:  Strings that differ beyond MAXI2 bytes will be equal.
**
** Inputs:
**	a	{char *}  The first string.
**	al	{nat}  The first minumum length (in characters, not bytes.)
**	b	{char *}  The second string.
**	bl	{nat}  The second minumum length (in characters, not bytes.)
**
** Returns:
**	{nat}	== 0	on match.
**		< 0	if first string is lexically less than second.
**		> 0	if second string is lexically less than first.
**
** History:
**	2-15-83   - Written (jen)
**	5-6-83   - handle case where length(a) < al, etc. (cfr)
**	5-13-83  - Changed to do full string compare if both
**		   al and bl are zero.
**	9/87 (bobm)	Convert to CM use for scanning strings
**	10/87 (bobm)	Integrate 5.0 (correct arg types to CL spec)
**	07/29/88 (jhw)  Optimized with modified algorithm for about 50%
**			improvement in performance (mostly by removing calls
**			to 'STlength()' and 'STnlength()'!!!)
**      06/19/92 (stevet)
**			Fixed B44916: STbcompare does not decrement length
**			correctly, should use CMbytedec().
**	30-nov-92 (pearl)
**		Add #ifdef for "CL_BUILD_WITH_PROTOS" and prototyped function
**		headers.
**	08-feb-93 (pearl)
**		Add #include of st.h.
**      8-jun-93 (ed)
**              Changed to use CL_PROTOTYPED
**	11-aug-93 (ed)
**	    unconditional prototypes
**	13-Jan-2010 (wanfr01) Bug 123139
**	    Optimizations for single byte
