**Name:	utldcob.ccpp - UT Loader Rules Definition File when using COBOL
**                     procedures.
**
** Description:
**	This file is used to create variant "utldcob.def" files for
**	different target systems.  It specifies rules used to link
**	objects.  It is seperate from utld.def because it explicitly uses
**	cob to load objects rather than ld or cc.  This is done to pull in
**	the appropiate COBOL libraries when building executables that contain
**	COBOL procedures.  The user is expected  to set the environmental
**	variables COBDIR to point to the path that the COBOL interpreter 
**	resides and II_UTLD_FILE to point to the path where utldcob.def
**	resides.
**
**	Create the file via:
**
**		ccpp utldcob.ccpp > utldcob.def
**
**	If a two letter word beginning with the character '%' is read
**	from the file, it is interpreted as follows:
**
**		%O - the name of the output file is substituted
**		%D - the name of the directory containing the
**		     object files is substituted
**		%i - the input files, the list of object files
**		     from the objs[] argument, is substituted
**		     (with relative path names)
**		%L - the libraries, the list of libraries from
**		     the usrlist[] argument, is substituted
**		%% - the character '%' is substituted
**
** History:    $Log-for RCS$
**	13-nov-1990 (kevinm)
**		File initially added.
**	08-apr-1991 (bentley)
**		File introduced for 63/02p on dr6_us5. Copied from mule  
**		(dr6_us5 62/03u). Added libraries - socket, nsl.
**	31-May-1991 (bentley)
**		Enabled dra_us5 machine to pick up the cobol linking
**		command.
**	21-Jun-1991 (jkb)
**		Add entry for sqs_ptx
**	26-nov-1991 (bentley)
**		File added for ingres63p.
**	24-mar-1992 (pauland)
**		Changes made to the libraries supplied with
**		DRS/NX 3000 SVR4 Version 5 (dra_us5) requires a change to the
**		link options for COBOL. Change also compatible with
**		DRS/NX 6000 SVR4 Version 5 (dr6_us5).
**	04-nov-1992 (peterw)
**		File added. (Took copy from ingres63p)
**	21-oct-1993 (dianeh)
**		Change the "#if 0" to C-style comments, to accommodate the
**		new portable preprocessor, yapp (beside, it's more normal).
**	25-feb-1994 (dianeh)
**		Added a "default" so utldcob.def doesn't go out as an empty
**		file; this helps in 2 ways: 1) people won't be confused about
**		why it's empty (since it won't be anymore); and, 2) it won't
**		infinitely rebuild, since the timestamp will now be bumped
**		when it writes out either the "default" or a command-line.
**	23-may-1997 (canor01)
**		Replaced undefined preprocessor directive with "#error".
**	08-Dec-1998 (kosma01)
**		Sequent changed the default socket library from ABI to BSD when 
**		DYNIX/ptx 4.4 came out. Since BSD sockets are available on 
**		4.2, this change uses BSD sockets for the current (4.2) and future
**		(4.4 and beyond) OS releases.
**      12-Mar-2008 (hanal04) Bug 119979
**              Windows does not like #error so we get an empty file and buildrel
**              complains. Does include the # on Windows.
