/**
** Name:	utedit.c -	Edit file.
**
**	Function:
**		UTedit
**
**	Arguments:
**		char		*editor;	* name of editor to spawn *
**		LOCATION	*filename;	* name of file to edit    *
**
**	Result:
**		edit the file 'filename' with 'editor'.  If 'editor' is
**			NULL or can't be found the default editor is spawned.
**
**	Side Effects:
**		Obviously 'filename' can be changed.
**
**	History:
**
**		Revision 3.1  85/06/05  20:12:59  wong
**		Changed to ignore exit status of editor.
**		
**		Revision 3.0  85/05/08  12:21:01  wong
**		Deleted extraneous function declarations.
**		
**		03/83 -- (gb)
**			written
**
**		12/84 (jhw) -- 3.0 Integration.
**		06/01/87 (daveb& lin) PCwait now take a pid by value.
**			  It is fixed so the old bug requiring a PCwait
**			  sometimes after a failed PCspawn is no longer
**			  required.
**	30-may-90 (blaise)
**	    Integrated changes from 61 and ingresug:
**		Look at VISUAL and EDITOR before ING_EDIT, because ING_EDIT
**		will be set at system level default, and you want the user's
**		EDITOR to win.
**	8-may-90 (blaise)
**	    NMgtAt is a void and therefore cannot be compared with OK. 
**	    Changed successive calls to NMgtAt, which check for VISUAL, EDITOR
**	    and ING_EDIT, from a long if to an iterative loop, which no
**	    longer attempts to compare the function value with OK.
**	15-jul-93 (ed)
**	    adding <gl.h> after <compat.h>
**	19-jun-95 (emmag)
**	    The default editor on NT should be notepad.exe
**	26-jun_95 (sarjo01)
**	    For NT, just do system() to launch edit session.
**	15-may-97 (mcgem01)
**	    Clean up compiler warnings.
**	24-nov-1997 (canor01)
**	    Launch subprocess with PC_WAIT, not PC_NO_WAIT.  Let the code
**	    in PC deal with waiting for the process to end.
**  12-may-98 (kitch01)
**		Bug 88211. On Windows95 system() does not wait for the called process
**		to exit before control is returned.Modified to call pcdowindowcmdline()
**		to run the chosen editor and wait for completion.
**      03-aug-1999 (rigka01) - bug# 96875
**	    As a result of change 438134 for bug/sir #93752, when the ING_EDIT
**	    editor is spawned successfully and exits with a return code,
**	    that return code is now returned in UTstatus. This incorrectly
**	    causes this routine to attempt to start the default editor.
**	    This routine has been changed to remove this attempt in that
**	    case.
**	15-Jun-2004 (schka24)
**	    Safe env variable handling.
**	17-Jun-2004 (schka24)
**	    I missed the input param, also untrustworthy.
**      06-Sep-2010 (coomi01) b124361
**          Sep improvements
