** TEtest is used to test forms programs.
** in and out are the names of files to open for reading and
** writing.
**
**	history:
**		2/85 (ac) -- made stdin nonbuffered.
**		8/85 (joe) -- Now uses IIfe_tpin for input.
**
**		Revision 30.3  86/02/06  18:27:18  roger
**		We can only reassign stdin to the keystroke file
**		when testing with AT&T curses, which unconditionally
**		reads therefrom.  This means that calls to TEswitch
**		will fail, and in particular, that the Keystroke
**		File Editor cannot be used with AT&T INGRES.
**
**		24-may-89 (mca)
**			Added support for opening TCFILEs, as needed by SEP.
**			While the "out_type" formal parameter was added to
**			the spec, TEtest does not now support opening TCFILEs
**			for output, since it's never called upon to do so
**			and the TE output routines don't support it
**			anyway.
