/**
** Name: BSI.H - interface to byte stream and message IPC routines
**
** Description:
**	This file describes the interface to the BS drivers.  Each
**	driver provides interprocess communication via some OS provided
**	byte stream or message service.  Byte stream services do not
**	preserve message boundaries; examples are TCP, FIFO's, streams,
**	etc.  Message services do preserve message boundaries; examples
**	are DECNET, OSI TP.
**
**	There is one driver for each interface to each IPC service.  
**	For example support for TCP via sockets, TCP via TLI, and UNIX 
**	domain sockets requires three drivers.
**
**	The BS drivers provide support to the UNIX GCA CL and GCC CL.  It
**	looks like this:
**
**	        GCA CL            GCC CL
**	              \          / | \
**	                \      /   |   \	<- bs interface
**	                  \  /     |     \
**			  BS1      BS2    BS3
**
**	The GCA CL calls a single configuration selectable BS driver, while
**	the GCC CL can support multiple BS drivers at once, to provide
**	support for multiple protocols.  GCA only makes intra-host
**	connections, while GCC makes inter-host connections.  BS drivers
**	written solely for GCA need not support functionality used only by
**	GCC, and vice versa.
**
**	Each BS driver can support multiple, simultaneous connections.
**
**	Each BS driver makes external only one symbol, a BS_DRIVER
**	structure which contains pointers to its dozen odd functions and
**	some configuration information.
**
**	BS driver functions are synchronous (i.e. they do not have a
**	callback interface), but each BS driver provides a
**	(*regfd)() function which will call iiCLfdreg to
**	register for a future synchronous driver function call.
**
**	Except where noted, BS driver functions take as their only argument
**	a pointer to a BS_PARMS structure, which contains all input and
**	output parameters.
**
**	Each BS driver that accepts incoming connections has a private data
**	area of size driver->lbcbsize, allocated by the caller and passed
**	in as parms->lbcb for the (*listen)(), (*accept)(), (*regfd),
**	and (*unlisten) function calls.  This area must be allocated before
**	calling (*listen)() and may be freed after calling (*unlisten)().
**	This area will be at most BS_MAX_LBCBSIZE bytes.
**	
**	Each active connection has a private data area of size
**	driver->bcbsize, allocated by the caller and passed in as
**	parms->bcb for the (*accept)(), (*request)(), (*connect)(),
**	(*send)(), (*receive)(), (*regfd)(), (*save)(), and (*restore)()
**	calls.  This area must be allocated before calling (*accept)() or
**	(*request)() and may be freed after calling (*close)().  This area
**	will be at most BS_MAX_BCBSIZE bytes.
**
#ifdef VMS
**	This section describes the way in which this module is used for
**	VMS protocol drivers.
**
**	The VMS BS driver functions (*accept)(), (*request)(),
**	(*send)(), (*receive)(), and (*close)() are asynchronous,
**	driving a callback routine when complete.  The other VMS BS
**	driver functions (*listen)(), (*unlisten)(), and (*portmap)()
**	are synchronous, returning when complete and driving no
**	callback routine.  
**
**	Because the asynchronous routines drive their callbacks, there
**	is no (*regfd)() or (*connect)() function.
**
**	Because this interface is used only for protocol drivers, there
**	is no (*save)(), (*restore)(), or (*detect)() function.
**
**	All error codes returned should be treated as FAIL, because BS
**	error messages are not available on VMS.

/*
** Name: BS_DRIVER - BS driver entry points
**
** Description:
**	Each BS driver makes external only one symbol, a BS_DRIVER
**	structure which contains pointers to its dozen odd functions and
**	some configuration information.
**
**	Except where noted, all functions are VOID.
**
**	Except where noted, BS driver functions take as their only argument
**	a pointer to a BS_PARMS structure, which contains all input and
**	output parameters.
**
**	The functions which a BS driver must provide are given below.  Only
**	the per function parameters are described here: see BS_PARMS for
**	the generic ones.
**
**	    (*driver->listen)( &parms )
**		Open the driver and allow it to accept incoming
**		connections.  The requested listen port is represented
**		by the null terminated string parms->buf, which is then
**		pointed at a buffer containing the actual listen port.
**		This function initializes the contents of parms->lbcb 
**		and does not reference parms->bcb.
**
**	    (*driver->unlisten)( &parms )
**		Close the driver.
**	
**	    (*driver->accept)( &parms )
**		Accept an incoming connection.  The caller must first call
**		(*driver->regfd)() with the BS_POLL_ACCEPT flag to register
**		for this operation via iiCLfdreg().  This function
**		initializes the contents of parms->bcb.  If this 
**		function fails, client will call (*driver->close)().
**
**	    (*driver->request)( &parms )
**		Make outgoing connection request.  The target listen
**		address is represented by the null terminated string
**		parms->buf, whose syntax is either "port" for local
**		addresses or "host::port" for remote, off-host addresses.
**		This function initializes the contents of parms->bcb.
**		If this function fails, client will call (*driver->close)().
**
**	    (*driver->connect)( &parms )
**		Complete outgoing connection request.  The caller must
**		first call (*driver->regfd)() with the BS_POLL_CONNECT flag
**		to register for this operation via iiCLfdreg().  If this 
**		function fails, client will call (*driver->close)().
**
**	    (*driver->send)( &parms )
**		Send parms->len bytes starting at parms->buf.  The caller
**		must first call (*driver->regfd)() with the BS_POLL_SEND
**		flag to register for this operation via iiCLfdreg().  Short
**		sends are permitted:  parms->len and parms->buf will be
**		decremented and incremented, respectively, by the number of
**		bytes actually sent.
**
**	    (*driver->receive)( &parms )
**		Receive parms->len bytes starting at parms->buf.  The
**		caller must first call (*driver->regfd)() with the
**		BS_POLL_RECEIVE flag to register for this operation via
**		iiCLfdreg().  Short receives are permitted:  parms->len and
**		parms->buf will be decremented and incremented,
**		respectively, by the number of bytes actually received.
**
**		A driver for a message service will set parms->len to 0 
**		to indicate that the last or only segment of a message 
**		has been received.
**
**	    (*driver->close)( &parms )
**		Close a connection.  parms->bcb may be subsequently
**		freed by the caller.
**
**	    BOOL 
**	    (*driver->regfd)( &parms )
**		Register for an accept, connect, send, or receive by
**		calling iiCLfdreg() with the appropriate file descriptor,
**		mode, and the parameters parms->func, parms->closure, and
**		parms->timeout.  This function returns TRUE if the
**		operation was registered and the caller should wait for
**		callback by iiCLpoll() before continuing, or FALSE if the
**		caller may continue immediately.  Be aware that flow of
**		control passes to the iiCLpoll() event mechanism when this
**		function returns TRUE: the caller should not subsequently
**		access parms.
**
**	    (*driver->save)( &parms ) (GCA only)
**		Prepare the parms->bcb area for a GCA_SAVE operation.
**		The process will fork and the child will invoke 
**		(*driver->restore)(). 
**
**	    (*driver->restore)( &parms ) (GCA only)
**		Recover the parms->bcb area for a GCA_RESTORE operation.
**
**	    STATUS
**	    (*driver->portmap)( char *port_in, nat subport, char *port_out )
**		(GCC only)
**		Map symbolic port address to an address suitable for
**		handing to (*driver->listen)() or (*driver->request)().
**		Port_in is the symbolic GCC listen port address (such as
**		that entered by the user with NETU), and port_out is the
**		result buffer.  Subport is a number (>=0) representing a
**		variation of port_in, and is used for programmatic
**		preturburation of port names.  Returns FAIL when subport is
**		out of range, OK otherwise.
**
**		For example, for TCP if port_in=XY, then
**		port_out=28872..28879 for subport 0..7.  Returns FAIL
**		on subport >7.  If port_in=20000, then port_out=20000
**		for subport 0.  Returns fail on subport >0.
**
** History:
**	16-Apr-90 (seiwald)
**	    Written.
**	15-Oct-91 (hasty)
**	    increased size of BS_MAX_BCBSIZE to accomodate the SNALU0 driver
**	04-Mar-93 (edg)
**	    Removed detect.
