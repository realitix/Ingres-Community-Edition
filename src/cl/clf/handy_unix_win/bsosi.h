** Name: bsosi.h - common definitions for BS interface to OSI
**
** History:
**	14-Mar-92 (sweeney)
**	    Cloned from bstliio.h 
**	29-Mar-92 (sweeney)
**	    added a struct t_bind and i4 tsdu
**	    to allow non-use of t_getinfo.
**	9-Sep-92 (gautam)
**	    Isolated OSI related information only into this file.
**	    bstliosi.c now includes both this file and bstliio.h.
**	13-Sep-92 (gautam)
**	    Added in HP-UX specific information
**	18-Mar-94 (rcs)
**	    Bug #59572
**	    MAX_TSAP_SIZE increased to 1024, since we know this is
**	    required on some platforms (eg. ICL).
**      09-feb-95 (chech02)
**          Added rs4_us5 for AIX 4.1.
**      29-Mar-99 (hweho01)
**          Added support for AXI 64-bit (ris_u64) platform.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	23-jul-2001 (stephenb)
**	    Add support fir i64_aix
**	22-Jun-2009 (kschendel) SIR 122138
**	    Use any_aix, sparc_sol, any_hpux symbols as needed.
