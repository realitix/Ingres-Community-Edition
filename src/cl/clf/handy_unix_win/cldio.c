/**
**
**  Name: cldio.c -- possibly direct disk i/o for use within the CL.
**
**  Description:
**
**	This module provides a combined seek/read and seek/write
**	interface for disk i/o, mapping nearly directly to the raw UNIX
**	system calls.
**
**	Although cldio.c is in "handy_unix_win", it's really UNIX specific,
**	and is not compiled for Windows.
**
**  Intended Uses:
**
**	This should be used by DI and LG, so that system specific i/o
**	enhancements such as synchronous direct i/o can be neatly
**	encapsulated with one set of ifdefs rather than spread all over.
**
**  Interface:
**
**    The file defines the following visible functions.
**
**	IIdio_open( file, mode, perms, err )
**
**	    Wrapper for UNIX open(2) system call, may do something system
**	    specific.
**
**	IIdio_read( fd, buf, len, off, loffp, err )
**
**	    This does a combined seek and read, possibly optimizing the
**	    seek if the current offset, stored at the location pointed to
**	    by loffp, is the same as the desired location.  The saved offset
**	    will be updated if needed.
**
**	IIdio_write( fd, buf, len, off, loffp, err )
**
**	    This does a combined seek and write, possibly optimizing the
**	    seek if the current offset, stored at the location pointed to
**	    by loffp, is the same as the desired location.  The saved offset
**	    will be updated if needed.
**
**	IIdio_writev( fd, buf, len, off, loffp, err )
**
**	    This does a combined seek and writev, possibly optimizing the
**	    seek if the current offset, stored at the location pointed to
**	    by loffp, is the same as the desired location.  The saved offset
**	    will be updated if needed.
**
**	IIdio_get_file_eof( fd )
**	    
**	    This finds a file eof, including raw files.  For most
**	    files on most systems this is a simple lseek, but raw files
**	    on some systems require a binary search.
**
**      And the private
** 
**	IIdio_compute_file_size( file_desc )
**
**          This does a binary search of the specified file to get its size.
**	    Used only by LG to sense end of raw log files.
**
**	IIdio_rw( op, fd, buf, len, off, loffp, err )
**
**	dolog()
**
**	IIdio_get_reserved() -- get space allocated to a file
**	IIdio_reserve() -- Reserve persistent space beyond EOF
**
**  History:
**	27-jun-89 (daveb)
**		Created.
**	11-july-89 (daveb)
**		Handle unaligned buffers for raw i/o.
**		Add IIdio_open(), changed names to IIdio_read and IIdio_write,
**		add CL_ERR_DESCs to the arguments.
**	22-jul-89 (daveb)
**		Sanity build revealed that a compiler that really wants
**		static char funct() forward ref to match the function
**		definition.  Add the static to getalbuf().
**	24-jul-89 (daveb)
**		don't try to do the Bmap Cache stuff if the symbol 
**		II_BMAP_CACHE isn't set to 'y'.  INGRES
**		would fall over on kernels that didn't support the system
**		calls; I had assumed that it would be a no-op to call them,
**		not fatal. oops.  
**
**		Change all symbols to look for 'y' as the "on" position.
**	2-aug-89 (kimman)
**		moved systypes.h top so it DECstation doesn't choke during
**		compiling 
**	22-jan-90 (mikem)
**		Copied over from NSE line of code into "termcl".
**	21-feb-90 (fredp)
**		Added xCL_081_SUN_FAST_OSYNC_EXISTS code.
**	16-Mar-90 (anton)
**		Changed DIO traceing to have several levels.
**	4-sep-90 (jkb)
**		define SQT_DIRECT_IO and IO_ALIGN for sqs_ptx
**	22-apr-91 (szeng)
**		Silencing warning about L_SET, L_INCR and L_XTND
**		redefined.
**	25-sep-1991 (mikem) integrated following change: 19-aug-91 (rogerk)
**		Don't align buffers before reading/writing unless acting on
**		a raw device.  Other read/write requests do not require
**		aligned buffers and copying them is pretty expensive.
**	10-dec-91 (jnash)
**		Include new IIdio_get_file_eof fn call to get end of
**		raw log files.  Used by LG, this routine is necessary 
**		cuz one can't always lseek to a raw file's eof.  Also added
**		IIdio_compute_file_size, called by former for raw logs.
**	05-Nov-1992 (mikem)
**	    su4_us5 port.  Changed direct calls to CL_NFILE to calls to new
**	    function iiCL_get_fd_table_size().
**	30-nov-1992 (rmuth)
**		Various changes.
**		 - Prototype code and add cldio.h
**		 - Change IIdio_get_file_eof 'fd' parameter to type int.
**      10-feb-1992 (smc)
**              Added time.h to define tm for axp_osf.
**	15-jul-93 (ed)
**	    adding <gl.h> after <compat.h>
**	26-jul-1993 (mikem)
**	    Closed comment in D_MIN_DISK_BLK_SIZE define, produced warning on
**	    su4_us5.
**      01-sep-93 (smc)
**          Commented lint pointer truncation warning.
**	14-sep-1993 (pearl)
**	    In IIdio_rw(), if environmental variable II_DIO_LSEEK_CHK is set, 
**	    check saved offset value by calling lseek().  Log if the offset 
**	    is incorrect.  This can be used to debug E_DM934D_DM0P_BAD_PAGE 
**	    errors.
**	07-oct-1993 (tad)
**	    Bug #56449
**	    Changed %x to %p for pointer values in IIdio_write(), 
**	    IIdio_read() and IIdio_rw().
**	14-oct-1993 (tad/swm)
**	    Bug #58877
**	    If Posix asynchronous disk IO is supported (for regular files),
**	    then xCL_ASYNC_IO can be defined. 
**	    Added include file aio.h, and added aio calls into 
**	    IIdio_write() and IIdio_read() if xCL_ASYNC_IO is enabled.
**	    Caveats:
**	    Before enabling xCL_ASYNC_IO the following should be checked
**	    carefully:
**	    o Is it supported for regular files as well as raw devices?
**	    o Would other file operations - open(), close(), rename(),
**	      mknod(), creat() ...  block? (It is ok for these to block
**	      in a slave process not in a DBMS server).
**	    o Are there sufficent file descriptors available in a DBMS to
**	      support the required number of GCA connections and async.
**	      disk i/o?
**	    o Does it actually perform better?
**	06-jun-1995 (canor01)
**	    semaphore protect memory allocation routines and statics
**	    for MCT server
**	03-jun-1996 (canor01)
**	    clean up semaphore protection for operating system threads
**	    Replace Posix async I/O with Solaris async I/O.
**      29-aug-1997 (musro02)
**          In dodirect, allow II_DIRECT_IO to be y or Y.
**      23-sep-1997/01-Apr-1997 (bonro01/mosjo01)
**          System includes before <compat.h> and
**          <bzarch.h> caused problems because defines for
**          POSIX thread support did not get defined before
**          system header files were included.
**      01-Apr-1997 (bonro01)
**                   System includes before <compat.h> and
**                  <bzarch.h> caused problems because defines for
**                  POSIX thread support did not get defined before
**                  system header files were included.
**      24-sep-1997 (hweho01)
**          Remove the preprocessor directive stmts for systypes.h file.
**      05-Nov-1997 (hanch04)
**          Remove declare of lseek, done in seek.h
**          Added LARGEFILE64 for files > 2gig
**          Change i4 to OFFSET_TYPE
**	23-feb-1998 (canor01)
**	    Restore the DIFILE_FD macro, which was lost in last massive
**	    integration.
**	22-Dec-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Removed use of static buffer (getalbuf()) for aligning raw data. 
**	    It wasn't thread safe (duh). 
**	    The onus is now on the raw data reader/writer
**	    to ensure that the data being written is properly aligned
**	    Defines of raw IO_ALIGN moved to dicl.h and renamed to
**	    DI_RAWIO_ALIGN so that everyone can know proper behavour.
**	10-may-1999 (walro03)
**	    Remove obsolete version string sqs_us5.
**	08-Jun-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Added IIdio_writev() for GatherWrite.
**	    ifdef'd out check for aligned raw buffers. On Solaris, it
**	    doesn't seem to matter and I'm unaware of any platform
**	    on which it does...
**	11-Nov-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Use CL_CLEAR_ERR instead of SETCLERR to clear CL_ERR_DESC.
**	    The latter causes a wasted ___errno function call.
**	25-feb-2000 (somsa01)
**	    Caught a couple of places where we should be typecasting the
**	    argiment to lseek64(). Also, use stat64() when LARGEFILE64
**	    is defined.
**	11-jul-2000 (somsa01 for jenjo01)
**	    ifdef'd out check for aligned raw buffers. On Solaris, it
**	    doesn't seem to matter and I'm unaware of any platform
**	    on which it does...
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	02-jan-2001 (mosjo01)
**	    by popular demand.. II_DIRECT_IO support for sqs_ptx has been 
**	    reinserted/reinstated (from Ingres 2.0). Since sqs_ptx currently
**	    DOES NOT use THREADS it is safe to use getalbuf(). It has been 
**	    demonstrated that sqs_ptx requires 512 for DI_RAWIO_ALIGN and in 
**	    most instances the higher level routines (ie, DI_SL_WRITE) will 
**	    pass an aligned buffer. Also it is necessary for sqs_ptx to rely
**	    on dodirect() inlieu of fisraw() to distingush when to use 
**	    Direct I/O system functions (ie, DirectRead and DirectWrite). 
**	    Considerable testing was performed that demonstrated that the code
**	    in cldio.c works with one minor exception and that is <temporary 
**	    tables> processed by gfault_page(). A change was made in dm0p.c
**	    to exit that function (defaulting back to single fault_page()) for
**	    <temporary tables> for xCL_064_SQT_DIRECT_IO only. 
**      28-feb-2001 (mosjo01)
**	    Emergency fix to my cross-integration from ingres25. I failed to 
**	    note changes to IIdio_rw now using D_READ, D_WRITE and D_WRITEV.
**	14-may-2002 (devjo01)
**	    Formalize support for Tru64's O_DIRECTIO flag.
**      28-May-2002 (hanal04) Bug 107686 INGSRV 1764
**          Made dodirect() available to Dialloc() by making it non-static
**          and adding the prototype to cldio.h
**	32-dec-2002 (hanch04)
**	    Fix cross integration, replace nat with i4
**	11-Mar-2005 (schka24)
**	    Add XFS to list of recognized Linux directio filesystems.
**  01-Apr-2004 (fanch01)
**      Add O_DIRECT support on Linux depending on the filesystem
**      properties, pagesize.  Fixups for misaligned buffers on read()
**      and write() operations.  Add generic support for more intelligently
**      performing some file system operations.
**  24-Jun-2005 (fanch01)
**      Remove warning if O_DIRECT mode fails.  Polyserve's PSFS masquerades
**      as OCFS and does not support O_DIRECT on fcntl(.. F_SETFL ..).
**      Hopefully a temporary workaround while Polyserve comes up with a
**      change of behavior on their end or a fast reliable method of detecting
**      the difference between the two.
**  07-Sep-2005 (fanch01)
**      Change sys/vfs.h include conditional to be more portable.
**      RedHat ES 3.0 unfortunately defined it's own struct statfs when
**      linux/fs.h was included.
**  29-Sep-2005 (hanje04)
**	Make similar sys/vfs.h change for AMD64 Linux. May need one for IA64
**	too, was hard to tell without building.
**  06-Oct-2005 (hanje04)
**	Yup, we need to conditionally include sys/vfs.h on IA64 Linux too.
**	14-Oct-2005 (jenjo02)
**	    Removed all Sequent-specific code, deprecated platform.
**	    Chris's file descriptor properties now cached in io_fprop
**	    (file properties) and established on the first open, 
**	    not every open.
**	    DIRECTIO is now requested on a per-file basis via
**	    DIopen(DI_DIRECTIO_MASK) rather than brute-force
**	    "all" files.
**	    Whether the server is configured for direct_io or not
**	    is determined by the config parameter
**	    "ii.$.$.$.direct_io: ON|OFF" and resolved by
**	    DIlru_init(), deprecating the dodirect() function.
**	    The slaves are told to use direct_io via the
**	    file's properties sent from the server
**	    (FPROP_DIRECT_REQ).
**   9-Nov-2006 (hanal04) SIR 117044
**      Include asm/ioctl.h for int_rpl build.
**   9-Nov-2006 (hanal04) SIR 117044
**      Remove asm/ioctl.h for int_rpl build. Latest Rpath Linux version
**      no longer requires it.
**	6-Nov-2009 (kschendel) SIR 122757
**	    Update direct-io handling.
**	    Add "reservations" soft-allocation type.  This modeled after
**	    the Datallegro XFS-reservations code, but uses fallocate()
**	    instead of (deprecated) XFS specific ioctls.
**	    Remove alignment realloc for linux, callers will do it now.
**	10-Jul-2010 (kschendel) b124063
**	    Because of the above auto-alignment removal, "mandatory" direct-IO
**	    no longer works.  It's a bad idea anyway, callers should decide,
**	    not this low level.  (I assume the mandatory setting was for
**	    performance, not correctness;  any fstype that operates incorrectly
**	    when direct-IO is OFF should be banned outright!)  Remove the
**	    notion of forced direct-IO.
**	12-Nov-2010 (kschendel) SIR 124685
**	    Drop an obsolete hp3 conditional.
**	29-Nov-2010 (frima01) SIR 124685
**	    Add static declaration to II_dio_do_lseek.
**     13-Jul-2011 (hanal04) SIR 125458
**         Update cs_elog calls inline with sc0e_putAsFcn changes.

**	12-jul-89 (daveb)
**		Created to make handling machines with direct i/o easier.
**	05-Nov-1992 (mikem)
**	    su4_us5 port.  Changed direct calls to CL_NFILE to calls to new
**	    function iiCL_get_fd_table_size().
**	30-nov-1992 (rmuth)
**	    Prototype.
**      10-feb-1993 (smc)
**          Defined a local throw away variable of type STATUS, the address 
**          of which can be passed to MEreqmem and so adhere to the
**          prototype of that function.
**      12-may-1994 (rog)
**          Don't set the sticky bit on files that are not O_SYNCed.
**	28-feb-2000 (somsa01)
**	    Use stat64() when LARGEFILE64 is defined.
**	18-May-2000 (bonro01)
**	    Allocate FD table with an additional number of entries
**	    equal to STREAM_RESVFD when xCL_RESERVE_STREAM_FDS is used.
**	    This caused a problem because fcntl() will return a duplicate
**	    file descriptor over the MAX FD limit.
**	14-may-2002 (devjo01)
**	    Formalize support for Tru64's O_DIRECTIO flag.
**	27-Mar-2003 (jenjo02)
**	    Added directio() to bypass system caching when "possible"
**	    (see man page for directio). xCL_DIRECTIO_EXISTS is set
**	    by mksecret if the directio() function exists.
**	    The user enables it with the environment variable
**	    II_DIRECT_IO Y|y. This interpretation is disabled for 
**	    sqs_ptx (xCL_064_SQT_DIRECT_IO), for which II_DIRECT_IO
**	    has a distinctly different meaning. SIR 109925.
**	01-Apr-2004 (fanch01)
**	    Add O_DIRECT support on Linux depending on the filesystem
**          properties, pagesize.  Fixups for misaligned buffers on read()
**          and write() operations.  Add generic support for more intelligently
**          performing some file system operations.
**	15-Apr-2004 (fanch01)
**          Enable O_DIRECT for ext3 page sizes smaller than 4k if the

**	19-aug-04 (toumi01)
**	    Ugly hack to include the right Linux headers for O_DIRECT for the
**	    system library level. Can't test e.g. __GLIBC_MINOR__ because this
**	    seems to change from 2.3.2 to 2.3.3 and there's no easy wasy to get
**	    that third version digit without executing /lib/libc.so.6. So by

**	    BUG 115917
**	    Include sys/ioctl.h on Linux as we call ioctl() in IIdio_open().

**	14-Oct-2005 (jenjo02)
**	    Whether DIRECTIO should be used or not now depends on

**	    The fallocate strategy is a performance loser outside of
**	    partitioned / parallelized data warehouse environments.
**	    (The fallocate strategy slows down loads but gives better
**	    disk layouts for later reads.)
**	10-Jul-2010 (kschendel) b124063
**	    Because of the auto-alignment removal, "mandatory" direct-IO
**	    no longer works.  It's a bad idea anyway, callers should decide,
**	    not this low level.  (I assume the mandatory setting was for
**	    performance, not correctness;  any fstype that operates incorrectly
**	    when direct-IO is OFF should be banned outright!)  Remove the
**	    notion of forced direct-IO.

** Name: IIdio_compute_file_size    - determine the size of a raw file.
**
** Description:
**	Unfortunately, "lseek-to-the-end" doesn't work on a raw file.
**	Therefore, we have come up with a binary search algorithm which
**	determines the file size by figuring out, using a binary search, the
**	highest offset which we can successfully read from.
**
**	the following method is used to determine the length of the file
**	rather than a simple seek() , so that we can use the same code for
**	both normal and for "raw" log files.  Even in the worse case we
**	only use approximately 20 reads, and this is only called when the
**	rcp is starting up or while running rcpconfig.
**
**	Most device drivers will onlys support raw reads on block boundaries
**	so we will limit the search to D_MIN_DISK_BLK_SIZE ("2K" currently)
**	blocks.
**
**	This function takes a file descriptor and returns the file size in
**	blocks, where the block size is D_MIN_BLK_SIZE.
**
**	Note that for raw database (not log) files, dm2f should prevent this
**	function from ever being called!
**
** Inputs:
**	file_desc	file descriptor of the file

** Returns:

/*
** Name: IIdio_reserve - Reserve space for file (using fallocate)
**
** Description:
**
**	This routine reserves disk space for a file without changing
**	its EOF pointer.  The reservation is done using fallocate(),
**	which purports to efficiently allocate disk space to a file.
**
**	By using fallocate to reserve persistent disk space, we hope
**	to get better (more sequential) allocation for large files,
**	especially when files are extended concurrently (e.g. as
**	typically happens when creating partitioned tables).
**
**	The fallocate strategy can be slightly slower than allowing the
**	filesystem to do all the work, at least on XFS, when only one
**	thread is writing one file.  For this reason, it is not enabled
**	by default.  The !.fallocate config parameter must be set ON
**	to enable fallocate reservations.  (The parameter is read/set
**	at open time, not here.)  Highly partitioned and/or parallelized
**	data warehouse type environments which produce large tables
**	and repeatedly read them will want fallocate ON.
**
**	Fallocate does not work on all filesystems, nor does it
**	work on non-Linux platforms.  For any platform or filesystem
**	lacking fallocate, DI_BADFILE is returned.  (The caller can
**	interpret DI_BADFILE as a "don't try reservations again"
**	error code.  Unfortunately there seems to be no way to pre-check
**	the validity of fallocate() without actually using it.)
**   
** Inputs:
**      fd		File descriptor for the file to 
**			reserve space for.
**      start		start is the offset to start reserving at, should
**			be the current end-of-reserved space.
**      len		The length of the reservation to make.
**	err_code	an output
**
** Outputs:
**      err_code	CL_ERR_DESC * additional error info if error
** 
** Returns:
**	OK or DI_xxx error status.
**	DI_BADFILE specifically means "operation not supported"
** 				
** Exceptions:
**        none
**
** Side Effects:
**        If successful, additional space is reserved for the
** given file descriptor.
