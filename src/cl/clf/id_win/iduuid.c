** Name: IDuuid_create
** 
** Description:
**	Generate a Universally Unique ID (UUID) based on the
**	Internet-Draft by Paul J. Leach (Microsoft) and Rich Salz
**	(Certco) of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
**	and dated 4-feb-1998.
**
**	"A UUID is an identifier that is unique across both space and time,
**	with respect to the space of all UUIDs. To be precise, the UUID
**	consists of a finite bit space. Thus the time value used for 
**	constructing a UUID is limited and will roll over in the future
**	(approximately at A.D. 3400, based on the specified algorithm). A
**	UUID can be used for multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an
**	extremely short lifetime, to reliably identifying very persistent
**	objects across a network."
**
**	The basic format of the 128-bit UUID is:
**
**	Field			Data type	Octet	Note
**						#
**
**	time_low		unsigned 32	0-3	The low field of the
**				bit integer		timestamp.
**
**	time_mid		unsigned 16	4-5	The middle field of the
**				bit integer		timestamp.
**
**	time_hi_and_version	unsigned 16	6-7	The high field of the
**				bit integer		timestamp multiplexed
**							with the version number.
**	
**	clock_seq_hi_and_rese	unsigned 8	8	The high field of the
**	rved			bit integer		clock sequence
**							multiplexed with the
**							variant.
**
**	clock_seq_low		unsigned 8	9	The low field of the
**				bit integer		clock sequence.
**
**	node			unsigned 48	10-15	The spatially unique
**				bit integer		node identifier.
**
**Name: IDuuid_create_seq
**      For security reasons, UuidCreate was modified so that it no longer uses
**      a machine's MAC address to generate UUIDs. UuidCreateSequential was
**      introduced to allow creation of UUIDs using the MAC address of a
**      machine's Ethernet card.
**      In Windows XP/2000, the UuidCreate function generates a UUID that
**      cannot be traced to the ethernet/token ring address of the computer on
**      which it was generated. It also cannot be associated with other UUIDs
**      created on the same computer. If you do not need this level of security
**      your application can use the UuidCreateSequential function, which
**      behaves exactly as the UuidCreate function does on all other versions
**      of the operating system.

/* Name: IDuuid_sequence
**
** Description:
**	"For UUID version 1, the clock sequence is used to help avoid
**	duplicates that could arise when the clock is set backwards in time
**	or if the node ID changes.
**
**	"If the clock is set backwards, or even might have been set
**	backwards (e.q., while the system was powered off), and the UUID
**	generator can not be sure that no UUIDs were generated with timestamps
**	larger than the value to which the clock was set, then the clock
**	sequence has to be changed.  If the previous value of the clock
**	sequence is known, it can be just incremented; otherwise it should
**	be set to a random or high-quality pseudo random value.
**
**	"Similarly, if the node ID changes (e.g. because a network card has
**	been moved between machines), setting the clock sequence to a random
**	number minimizes the probability of a duplicate due to slight
**	differences in the clock settings of the machines. (If the value of
**	clock sequence associated with the changed node ID were known, then
**	the clock sequence could just be incremented, but that is unlikely.)
**
**	"The clock sequence MUST be originally (i.e., once in the lifetime of
**	a system) initialized to a random number to minimize the correlation
**	across systems.  This provides maximum protection against node
**	identifiers that may move or switch from system to system rapidly.
**	The initial value MUST NOT be correlated to the node identifier."
