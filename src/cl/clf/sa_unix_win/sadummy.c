** Name: SA.C - contains all routines for the SA sub-library
**
** Description:
**	Routines for the SA sub-library, these routines are designed to
**	provide an interface to the operating system for the management of
**	the operating system audit trail. Initialy the only operations
**	supported will be:
**	    SAopen - Open an audit trail
**	    SAclose - Close an audit trail
**	    SAflush - Flush buffered records to the operating system audit trail**	    SAwrite - Write a record to the operating system audit trail.
** History:
**	7-jan-94 (stephenb)
**	    Initialy created as stubs.
**	28-feb-94 (stephenb)
**	    Update to current SA spec.
**	15-mar-94 (ajc)
**	    Added hp8_bls port specific stuff
**	9-may-94 (robf)
**          - Moved headers so sadummy.c would compile, need to have tm.h
**	    before sacl.h.
**	    - Added me.h, required for MEreqmem.
**	    - Correctly coerce the sa_desc values in STcompare, before we
**	      were trying to get the member (sa_desc) of a PTR, which doesn't
**	      exist.
**	26-sep-95 (allst01)
**	    Added dr6_ues
**	08-feb-1996 (sweeney)
**	    Make the definition of SAtrim match its declaration.
**      03-jun-1996 (canor01)
**          New ME for operating-system threads does not need external
**          semaphores. Removed ME_stream_sem.
**	27-may-97 (mcgem01)
**	    Clean up compiler warnings.
**	10-may-1999 (walro03)
**	    Remove obsolete version string dr6_ues.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	20-Jul-2004 (lakvi01)
**		SIR #112703, cleaned-up warnings.
**      26-Jul-2004 (lakvi01)
**          Backed-out the above change to keep the open-source stable.
**          Will be revisited and submitted at a later date. 
**	11-May-2009 (kschendel) b122041
**	    Compiler warning fixes.
**      13-Jul-2011 (hanal04) SIR 125458
**          Update cs_elog calls inline with sc0e_putAsFcn changes.

** Name: SAopen - open an operating system audit trail
**
** Description:
**	Open an operating system audit trail. Initialy this routine will
**	only support the writing of audit records (which are appended to
**	the end of the trail), thus the caller may only open the trail in
**	one mode, SA_WRITE. A descriptor will be returned from this routine
**	which may be used to refference the audit trail in future calls to
**	SA. The default operating system audit trail will be the only
**	supported trail, and this case the parameter aud_desc will be NULL.
**
** Inputs:
**	aud_desc		description of the audit trail to open
**	flags			flags to use when opening the audit trail
**
** Outputs:
**	aud_trail_d		descriptor to use for this audit trail
**	err_code		pointer to a variable used to return OS errors
**
** Returns:
**	OK              if operation succeeded
** 	SA_NOACCESS     user has no access to this audit trail
**	SA_BADPARAM     bad parameter values were passed to the routine
**	SA_NOPRIV       the user does not have privileges to read audit trails
**	SA_NOSUPP       the operation is not supported by this implimentation of**			SA.

**	is returned and no NULL terminator is placed on the string.
