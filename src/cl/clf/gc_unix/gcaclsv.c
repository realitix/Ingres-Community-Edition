**  Name: GC.C - GCA private CL routines
**
**  Description:
**
**          GCsave - Save system-dependent data structures
**          GCrestore - Restore system-dependent data structures
**
** History:
**	01-Jan-90 (seiwald)
**	    Removed setaside buffer.
**      24-May-90 (seiwald)
**          Built upon new BS interface defined by bsi.h.
**	    New BS interface include save/restore entry points.
**	06-Jun-90 (seiwald)
**	    Made GCalloc() return the pointer to allocated memory.
**	18-Jun-90 (seiwald)
**	    GCsave & GCrestore lng_user_data is a i4.
**	30-Jun-90 (seiwald)
**	    Private and Lprivate renamed to bcb and lbcb, as private
**	    is a reserved word somewhere.
**	2-Jan-91 (seiwald)
**	    Moved the bulk of the save/restore operation into GCA mainline.
**	6-Apr-91 (seiwald)
**	    Be a little more assiduous in clearing svc_parms->status on
**	    function entry.
**	18-Jun-91 (seiwald)
**	    Removed sanity check in GCsave which ensured that GC_send_sm 
**	    and GC_recv_sm were idle.  The idea was that if data were
**	    buffered before a process switch the line protocol would be
**	    corrupted.  In practice the only data ever buffered were
**	    chop marks, left around from an endretrieve.  This harmless 
**	    purging cruft made GCsave considered its state insane.  
**	    Ignorance is now once again bliss.
**	15-jul-93 (ed)
**	    adding <gl.h> after <compat.h>
**	20-aug-93 (ed)
**	    add missing include
**	10-Apr-97 (gordy)
**	    ACB removed from service parms, replaced by GC control block.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**      13-Jul-2011 (hanal04) SIR 125458
**          Update cs_elog calls inline with sc0e_putAsFcn changes.

** Name: GC_SAVE_DATA - structure for passing GC association between processes

** Description:
**	Connection information can be passed between parent/child

**	Note that this structure incorporates the BCB wholly.  BS

**
**	GC_SAVE_LEVEL_MAJOR must be changed if incompatible changes are

**	GC_SAVE_LEVEL_MINOR can be changed when minor, compatible,
**	changes are made to this structure.

**
** Description:
**	The caller passes a block of user data and an ACB to be saved, and a

**	dependent way, and are tagged with the save name in a way that will 
**	allow GCrestore to recover the data when passed the same save name.
**	GCsave must save any system-dependent substructures associated with 
**	the LCB, if required.
**
** Inputs:
**	    user_data		A poiner to a block of user data to be saved.
**	    lng_user_data	Length of the user data block.
**	    gc_cb		Our GCA_GCB
**	    save_name		A pointer to unique identifier for this save
***				operation
**
** Outputs:
**	    save_name		The name of a save area to be used by GCrestore.
**
**	Returns:
**	    STATUS		Success or failure indication
**		OK		Normal completion
**		GC_SAVE_FAIL	A system-dependent failure occurred
**
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
