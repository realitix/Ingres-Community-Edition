** Name:    CI.c    - This module is used for the coding and decoding of 
**		information.
**
** Description:
**        This module was originally written for encoding and decoding
**	authorization strings in the Ingres Distribution Keys project.
**	  The encryption and decryption algorithms are intended to be general
**	purpose enough to be used by the rest of the system where encoding
**	and decoding routines are required.
**
**	  The following routines are intended to be used by RTI system code:
**
**	CIchksum()	A function that computes the checksum of a binary
**			byte stream.
**      CIdecode()	This routine decodes cipher text to plain text using
**			a key string.
**      CIencode()      This routine encodes plain text to cipher text
**			using a key string.
**	CItobin()	This routine maps a string of characters to a block of
**			binary bytes.  The string of characters must have been
**			originally created using CItotext().
**	CItotext()	This routine maps binary data to a printable alphabet 
**			consisting of upper case letters excluding 'I' and 'O' and
**			digits excluding '0' and '1'.

**          Reinstated CIcapability().
**	28-jul-89 (jrb)
**	    Check for special authorization string which is now disallowed
**	    because it was mistakenly distributed in the I&O guide.

**	25-Jan-1994 (jpk)
**	    As per Authorization String Plan for 6.5, get rid of
**	    nearly-useless processor ID check, which had degenerated
** 	    to a processor model check only for VAX processors only.
**	    In return get back 32 more capabbility bits.
**	8 April 1994 (jpk)
**		Change II_AUTHORIZATION to II_AUTH_STRING.
**	14-apr-95 (emmag)  
**	    NT, OS/2 and Netware do not support Authorization Strings.
**	    Use xCL_NO_AUTH_STRING_EXISTS.
**	04-apr-1996 (thoda04)
**	    Added i4  as the return type to CIcapability()
**	    and CImk_capability_block().  They were missing altogether.
**	07-feb-1997 (canor01)
**	    Remove special authorization string that was mistakenly
**	    distributed in the I&O guide, since it is no longer valid
**	    with this new major release and subsequent DIST_KEY.
**	14-may-97 (mcgem01)
**	    Clean up compiler warnings.
**	06-may-1998 (canor01)
**	    Allow use of ca_license_check().
**	27-may-1998 (canor01)
**	    Include clconfig.h. Return error if requesting invalid capability
**	    bit.
**	28-may-1998 (canor01)
**	    Load the CA Licensing API shared library dynamically to avoid 
**	    having to explicitly link it in with every executable.
**	08-jun-1998 (musro02)
**	    Add sqs_ptx to platforms using the CA Licensing API (above)
**	08-Jun-1998 (allmi01)
**	    Add dgi_us5 to list of platforms to use the dynamic linking
**	    to the CA license code.
**	19-jun-1998 (muhpa01)
**	    Add code to dynamically load CA Licensing with shl_load/shl_findsym
**	    on hp8_us5.  Also, incorporate Orlan's 19-jun-1998 changes for
**	    dlopen into hp8_us5's use of shl_load().
**	24-Jun-1998 (allmi01)
**	    Corrected change by canor01 which mutexed the licensing code for
**	    all platforms instead of those which use OS threads only.
**	24-jun-1998 (canor01)
**	    Add include of cs.h.
**	25-Jun-1998 (merja01)
**		Add axp_osf to the list of platforms who load licensing
**		dynamically with dlopen.
**	07-jul-1998 (popri01)
**	    Enable Orlan's licensing code for Unixware (usl us5).
**	08-Jul-1998 (walro03)
**	    Add dr6_us5 to list of platforms to use the dynamic linking
**	    to the CA license code.
**	04-aug-98 (mcgem01)
**	    Add OpenROAD Development package for Enterprise Edition.
**      01-sep-98 (mcgem01)
**          Replace ca_license_check with ca_license_check_m and write
**	    all license messages to the errlog.
**	02-sep-98 (mcgem01)
**	    Don't report license success to the errlog.  Also check for
**	    a null license string.
**	02-sep-98 (mcgem01)
**	    Don't print empty license messages to the log.  Also, fix
**	    problem whereby we were truncating the messages prematurely.
**	11-sep-98 (mcgem01)
**	    Add a licensing bit for ICE.
**      11-Nov-98 (linke01)
**          Added pym_us5 and rmx_us5 to the list of platforms which load
**          licensing dynamically with dlopen.     
**	30-nov-98 (toumi01)
**	    For the free Linux version hack the II_AUTH_STRING code to
**	    check only the date in the string, so that we can ship with
**	    a string with NO products authorized (useless for other
**	    Ingres versions).  Thus, II_AUTH_STRING becomes just a "time
**	    bomb" enabler.
**	07-jan-1999 (canor01)
**	    Add new license component code for TNG_EDITION.
**      18-jan-1999 (matbe01)
**          Add nc4_us5 to list of platforms to use the dynamic linking
**          to the CA license code.
**	07-Feb-1999 (kosma01)
**	    Enable Orlan's licensing code for IRIX64 (sgi_us5).
**	29-jun-1999 (somsa01 for canor01)
**	    Added CIvalidate() to return the co. name and site-id from CA-lic.
**	    Moved license component code from CIcapability to CI_getcompcode.
**      03-jul-99 (podni01)
**          Added support for ReliantUNIX V 5.44 - rux_us5 (same as rmx_us5)
**	07-jul-1999 (somsa01)
**	    Changed references from nat to i4 introduced by previous cross
**	    integration.
**      21-aug-1999 (mcgem01)
**          Correct the parameters passed to the workgroup license
**          check routine.
**          License failure in the Workgroup Edition should be a soft
**          fail.
**	01-Oct-1999 (toumi01)
**	   Added lnx_us5 header and load ifdefs for CA licensing.
**	06-oct-1999 (toumi01)
**	   Change Linux config string from lnx_us5 to int_lnx.
**	04-nov-1999 (toum01)
**	   Modify Workgroup Edition licensing to support Linux (int_lnx).
**	11-nov-1999 (mcgem01)
**	    The black-box version of Ingres built for ACCPAC should
**	    not do any license enforcement.
**	09-may-2000 (thoda04)
**	    Disable CI check for XA (CI_XA_TUXEDO, CI_XA_CICS, CI_XA_ENCINA).
**	31-mar-2000 (mcgem01)
**	   Add 'Embedded Ingres' component codes for all products, not just
**	   the backend.
**      05-Apr-2000 (hweho01)
**          Add ris_u64 to list of platforms to use the dynamic linking
**          to the CA license code.
**	19-may-2000 (mcgem01)
**	    The calls to PMinit in CIcapablity and CIvalidate should be 
**	    followed by calls to PMload to load the PM context.  Also
**	    generecised this code - there should be no hard-coded references 
**	    to ii.
**	19-May-2000 (hanch04)
**	    Don't exit if PMload fails.  ingbuild checks to see if licensing
**	    is installed, but there is no config.dat yet.
**	22-may-2000 (somsa01)
**	    The recent adds of PMget() calls on embed_installation will
**	    cause a memory leak, as it will be done on any connect. Also,
**	    on HP-UX 11.0 the admin thread in the DBMS server SEGVs in
**	    PMload() for some reason during a RUN_ALL run. Therefore, we
**	    will now do this just one and save the value as a static.
**	    Also, in CIvalidate(), CI_getcompcode() was passing FALSE in as
**	    the second parameter, but it should now be passing
**	    embed_installation.
**	22-May-2000 (ahaal01)
**	    Add rs4_us5 to list of platforms to use the dynamic linking
**	    to the CA license code.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	14-jun-2000 (hanje04)
**	   Added ibm_lnx to free Linux version II_AUTH_STRING hack; and ifdefs 
**	   for CA licensing
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	7-Sep-2000 (hanje04)
**	    Added axp_lnx (Alpha Linux) header and load ifdefs for licensing,
**	    including WG support modifications.
**	09-sep-2000 (somsa01)
**	    PMinit() can also return PM_NO_INIT, which means that it's
**	    already been initialized.
**	30-jan-2001 (shust01)
**	    PMinit() has previously been changed to return PM_DUP_INIT,
**	    instead of PM_NO_INIT (change #448380).  Change code here to
**	    reflect this. PMinit() was returning PM_DUP_INIT, and we 
**	    skipped check for embed_installation.  So, for an Embedded 
**	    install, we were using the wrong license string. bug 103802.
**	22-sep-2000 (holgl01) bug 102653
**      The replicator non-embedded value for licensing needs to be 2JG2 instead
**      of 1JG2.  Final fix to bug 101325.
**	22-sep-2000 (somsa01)
**	    Amended previous change with proper multiple status check.
**	20-apr-1999 (hanch04)
**	    Load lic98_lp64.so for 64 bit OS
**	08-feb-2001 (somas01)
**	    Do not go through the LP64 code if NT_GENERIC is defined, as the
**	    look of an NT DLL does not match the look of a UNIX shared
**	    library.
**	22-Feb-2001 (hweho01)
**          Added liblic98.so as the shared lib name for dlopen() to search 
**          after lic98.so. The name of license library is lic98.o  
**          (provided by licensing group) for AIX (rs4_us5 and ris_u64)  
**          platforms.   
**	20-jul-2001 (stephenb)
**	    Add support for i64_aix
**	07-Sep-2001 (hanch04)
**	    Look for the lic98.so in /opt/CA/CAlib
**	07-Sep-2001 (hanch04)
**	    Added too many else in last change.
**	25-oct-2001 (devjo01)
**	    Make axp_osf an exception to the 64 bit platforms using
**	    lic98_lp64.so as their licensing library.
**	01-nov-2001 (devjo01)
**	    Per new licensing policy, CIcapability will always
**	    return OK, even if LIC_TERMINATE returned.
**	09-nov-2001 (devjo01)
**	    Hook in ca_license_release, and ca_license_log_usage.
**	12-Nov-2001 (hanje04)
**	    Removed dump of license information from CIcapability as it break
**	    iisudbms on UNIX.
**    03-Dec-2001 (hanje04)
**	  Added support for IA64 Linux (i64_lnx)
**	14-Dec-2001 (somsa01)
**	    Corrected retrieval of license checking function from license
**	    DLL for i64_win. Also, do not use ci_release_licenses() for now
**	    on Win64. In Licensing, ca_license_release() does nothing for
**	    now, and the invocation of ci_release_licenses() causes a SEGV
**	    in LIC98_64.DLL.
**	22-May-2000 (ahaal01)
**	    Add rs4_us5 to list of platforms to use the dynamic linking
**	    to the CA license code.
**	14-may-2002 (devjo01)
**	    Coerce user count to zero for CI_BACKEND also.
**	22-may-2000 (holgl01) bug 102653
**      The replicator non-embedded value for licensing needs to be 2JG2 instead
**      of 1JG2.  Final fix to bug 101325.
**      26-jul-2002 (mcgem01)
**          Add a licensing component code 2SLS for the spatial object
**          library.
**	31-jul-2002 (devjo01) bug 108428
**	    Modified change 455847 (addresses EDBC b107177, no 
**	    license component codes), to surpress unwanted CI error
**	    codes, and add desired timestamps.
**	08-aug-2002(somsa01)
**	    Changes for HP-UX 64-bit.
**	18-Sep-2002(hweho01)
**	    Changes for AIX 64-bit.
**	07-Oct-2002 (hanje04)
**	    As part of AMD x86-64 Linux port replace various linux defines
**	    with generic LNX define where apropriate.
**	22-nov-2002(mcgem01)
**	    Added a licensing component code of 2AOT for Advantage OpenROAD
**	    Transformation Runtime.
**	18-jun-2003 (somsa01)
**	    For HP PA-RISC 32-bit, updated the location of CAlib in
**	    CIcapability().
**	02-oct-2003 (somsa01)
**	    Ported to NT_AMD64.
**	14-may-2004 (somsa01)
**	    Corrected licensing file location for 64-bit Windows.
**	07-jun-2004 (somsa01)
**	    Updated call to RegQueryValueEx() such that we initialize dwSize
**	    in CIcapability().
**      11-Jun-2004 (hanch04)
**          Removed reference to CI for the open source release.
**      29-Nov-2010 (frima01) SIR 124685
**          Removed forward declarations - they reside in ci.h.

/*{
** Name:	CItotext	- map binary bytes to printable alphabet.
**
** Description:
**	    This routine maps a sequence of binary bytes to the characters
**	in a printable alphabet.  The printable alphabet consists of upper
**	case letters excluding 'O' and 'I' and digits excluding '0' and '1'.
**
** Inputs:
**	block	pointer to sequence of binary bytes to be mapped.
**	size	the number of binary bytes to be mapped.
**
** Outputs:
**	textbuf	pointer of output array to hold mapped printable characters.
**		IMPORTANT NOTE, this array's size must be greater than or equal
**		to CI_TOTEXT_SIZE_MACRO(size).  
**
** History: 
**	16-sep-85 (ericj) - written.
**	05-jan-86 (ericj) - modified to map to a new printable alphabet that
**			consists of characters that are easily distinguished on
**			our laser printer.
**	14-apr-95 (emmag)   
**		Desktop compilers insist that register variables be 
**		accompanied by a type name.
