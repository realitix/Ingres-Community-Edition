** Name:	cmkcheck	- check single or double byte character
**
** Description:
**	Check the next character in string for double byte character or
**	single.  If the next character is 1st byte of double byte 
**	character, this routine returnes the value _DBL1.  If the 
**	character is 2nd byte, this returnes the value _DBL2.  The
**	other characters, such as ASCII or Katakana, are represented
**	by the return value _A.  If the string is null or the next 
**	character is invalid, not range of double byte code, cmkcheck
**	retruns the value FALSE. 
**
** Inputs:
**	point	pointer to character to be checked.
**	strstart	start pointer of the string being processed
**		(or a location in the string which you know contains
**		the start of a character) as double byte processing
**		must reprocess the string from the start to decide
**		whether the character pointed by 'point' is double
**		byte character or single.
**
** Outputs:
**	Returns:
**		_DBL1	1st byte of double byte character
**		_DBL2	2nd byte of double byte character
**		_A	single byte character
**		FAIL	null string or invalid character
**
** Side Effects:
**	None
**
** History:
**	10-sep-1986 (yamamoto)
**		first written.
**	sep-90 (bobm)
**		changed old #define's (_A, etc) to new (CM_A_***).
**	15-jul-93 (ed)
**	    adding <gl.h> after <compat.h>
