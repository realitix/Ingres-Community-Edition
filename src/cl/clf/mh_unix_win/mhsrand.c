/*{
** Name: MHsrand() - Set random number generator.
**
** Description:
**	Initialize random number generator to a particular
**	starting point.  This should just plain work with no problems.
**
**	Note:   This routine sets a static variable, which is normally
**		discouraged in a server environment.  However, due to the
**		nature of the random number generator, it will probably not
**		effect the functioning of the MHrand() routine if many sessions
**		are actively sharing this variable.  In fact, it may indeed
**		give an added randomness to the routine!
**		
** Inputs:
**      seed                            Just any ol' number.
**
** Outputs:
**      none
**
**	Returns:
**	    OK
**
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	    Sets a static variable.  (See note in description above.)
**
** History:

**          Upgraded to Jupiter coding standards.
**      21-jul-87 (mmm)
**          Upgraded UNIX CL to Jupiter coding standards.
