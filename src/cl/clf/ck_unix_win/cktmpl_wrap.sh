# Name: cktmpl_wrap - Wrap script for Backup command
#
# Script to invoke the specified backup command, and if the backup command
# reports a failure, check whether the only messages reported were due to one
# or more file sizes changing during the backup. In this circumstance, the 
# backup command is deemed successful.
#
## History:
##	09-dec-2003 (horda03)
##	    Created.
##      20-apr-2004 (horda03) INGSRV2794/112172
##          To allow utility to work with Disk and Tape checkpoints
##          don't bother checking whether the archive file was created.
##          The backup utility should report a problem if it could not
##          create the archive file.
##      06-Oct-2009 (coomi01) b122689
##          Search trusted locations for executables to account for
##          different flavours of UNIX. 
##      08-Oct-2009 (coomi01) b122689
##          Adjusted to make more readable, and work correctly without
##          breaking out prematurely. 
##      03-Feb-2010 (coomi01) b123212
##          Change ambiguous word 'cmd' into System Command, 
##          or Target Command, so we do not confuse/overwrite them
#
# Modify the following line if you wish to use a different command
# to perform the backup from the one supplied by CKTMPL_WRAP.DEF file.


# Save the command we were called with.
targetCmd="$1"


# Modify the following assignment if the text listed is not the same as the
# text displayed by the command ($cmd) when the file being packed is altered
# during an ON-LINE checkpoint. "$" => End of Line.

# Modify the following line, to represent the expected output lines for the
# $cmd. For example, the TAR command will log the files added to the 
# archive in the form "^a <file> <size>" where "^" => Start of line

# will be created.
