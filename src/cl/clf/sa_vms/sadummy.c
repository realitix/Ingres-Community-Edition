** Name: SA.C - contains all routines for the SA sub-library
**
** Description:
**	Routines for the SA sub-library, these routines are designed to
**	provide an interface to the operating system for the management of
**	the operating system audit trail. Initialy the only operations
**	supported will be:
**	    SAopen - Open an audit trail
**	    SAclose - Close an audit trail
**	    SAflush - Flush buffered records to the operating system audit trail**	    SAwrite - Write a record to the operating system audit trail.
** History:
**	7-jan-94 (stephenb)
**	    Initialy created as stubs.
**	28-feb-94 (stephenb)
**	    Update to current SA spec.
**	15-mar-94 (ajc)
**	    Added hp8_bls port specific stuff
**	9-may-94 (robf)
**          - Moved headers so sadummy.c would compile, need to have tm.h
**	      before sacl.h.
**	    - Added me.h, required for MEreqmem.
**	    - Correctly coerce the sa_desc values in STcompare, before we
**	      were trying to get the member (sa_desc) of a PTR, which doesn't
**	      exist.
**	21-jun-94 (wolf) 
**          ifdef in SAsupports_osaudit() is missing the endif.
**	19-jul-2000 (kinte01)
**	   Correct prototype definitions by adding missing includes and
**	   external function references
**	01-dec-2000	(kinte01)
**	    Bug 103393 - removed nat, longnat, u_nat, & u_longnat
**	    from VMS CL as the use is no longer allowed
**	11-nov-2008 (joea)
**	    Use CL_CLEAR_ERR to initialize CL_ERR_DESC.

** Name: SAopen - open an operating system audit trail
**
** Description:
**	Open an operating system audit trail. Initialy this routine will

**	one mode, SA_WRITE. A descriptor will be returned from this routine
**	which may be used to refference the audit trail in future calls to
**	SA. The default operating system audit trail will be the only
**	supported trail, and this case the parameter aud_desc will be NULL.
**
** Inputs:
**	aud_desc		description of the audit trail to open
**	flags			flags to use when opening the audit trail
**
** Outputs:
**	aud_trail_d		descriptor to use for this audit trail
**	err_code		pointer to a variable used to return OS errors
**
** Returns:
**	OK              if operation succeeded
** 	SA_NOACCESS     user has no access to this audit trail
**	SA_BADPARAM     bad parameter values were passed to the routine

**	space or spaces) and null terminates it. The difference between this

**	of the string is reached before a blank is found the string length
**	is returned and no NULL terminator is placed on the string.
**
** Inputs:
**	string		- single word char string
**	length		- maximum length of the string
**
** Outputs:
**	string		- null terminated word
**
** Returns:
**	0 if blank was found, string length otherwhise.
** History:
