/**
** Name:    CI.c    - This module is used for the coding and decoding of 
**		information.
**
** Description:
**        This module was originally written for encoding and decoding
**	authorization strings in the Ingres Distribution Keys project.
**	  The encryption and decryption algorithms are intended to be general
**	purpose enough to be used by the rest of the system where encoding
**	and decoding routines are required.
**	  This file defines:
**
**	  The following routines are intended to be used by RTI system code:
**
**	CIchksum()	A function that computes the checksum of a binary
**			byte stream.
**      CIdecode()	This routine decodes cipher text to plain text using
**			a key string.
**      CIencode()      This routine encodes plain text to cipher text
**			using a key string.
**	CItobin()	This routine maps a string of characters to a block of
**			binary bytes.  The string of characters must have been
**			originally created using CItotext().
**	CItotext()	This routine maps binary data to a printable alphabet 
**			consisting of upper case letters excluding 'I' and 'O' and
**			digits excluding '0' and '1'.
