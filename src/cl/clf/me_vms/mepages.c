/**
**
**  Name: MEPAGES.C - A Page based memory allocator
**
**  Description:
**	MEPAGES grew out of the need for a page based allocator which would
**	allow the exploitation of shared memory and other "special" memory.
**	This abstraction also supports returning pages to the operating
**	system (if conditions allow.)
**
**	NOTICE: These routines are not necessarily re-entrant.  Semaphores
**	must be added to make that so.
**
**	Shared Memory Issues:
**	This file provides definitions for shared memory operations.  Since
**	Shared memory operations will only be available on a subset of machines
**	on which ingres runs, one must only use these routines to improve
**	performance rather than add functionality.
**
**	Mainline clients of these routines must provide the same functionality
**	if these features are not available.  An example of this is the global
**	cache.  On machines with shared memory the global cache will be 
**	implemented.  On machines which lack this feature the global cache will
**	not be implemented but the interface to the i/o system will be the
**	same except that it may run slower.
**
**	OUTSTANDING ISSUES:
**	
**	1) Permissions on the shared memory segment.  (UNIX Example)
**
**	   On unix all shared memory interfaces provided, require permission
**	   on the segment to map to normal unix file permissions.  This is not
**	   a current problem with shared memory usage in the dbms server, since
**	   permission on these segments will be made 600 (only readable and
**	   writable by the creator).  The creator in this case will be programs
**	   which have been made setuid to ingres.
**
**	   The problem will show up if shared memory is used to communicate
**	   between front end and dbms server.  The (unpleasant) options
**	   include:  (1) Set permissions to be world readable and writable
**	   so that both a random user and ingres can read and write to the
**	   segment. (2) Kludge the CL by making the server setuid root
**	   (which has always been an unwelcome option to our users).
**	   The security problem can be handled by a user enabled option in the 
**	   main-line to encode the data.
**
**	2) ME_USER_ALLOC and shared memory
**
**	   Because we allow user applications to use their system provided
**	   stream based memory allocator, some difficulties will appear if
**	   we wish to map shared memory into the user's address space.  This
**	   problem is extremely environment dependent; on UNIX, this is
**	   probably the most non-portable issue possible.  Fundamentally,
**	   the problem is how to prevent the user memory allocator from
**	   interference with foreign shared memory being added to a process'
**	   address space.  Neither the current INGRES product set nor this
**	   proposal require the configuration of shared memory into a user
**	   process' address space, hence we simply disallow MEget_pages,
**	   MEfree_pages, MEprot_pages, and MEsmdestroy during
**	   MEadvise(ME_USER_ALLOC).  The other ME allocation routines
**	   can be built on the user allocator without using MEget_pages.
**
**	This file defines:
**		MEadvise()      - Advise if user allocation nessasary
**		MEget_pages()	- Allocate shared or unshared memory pages.
**		MEfree_pages()	- return allocated pages to the free page pool.
**		MEprot_pages()	- Set protection attributes on a page range.
**		MEsmdestroy()	- Destroy an existing shared memory segment.
**		MEshow_pages()	- Show shared memory segments.

** Implementation Notes:
**
**	Implementation of Shared Memory routines on VMS:
**
**	    Shared Memory Segments on VMS are identified by a character
**	    string name.  This name is derived from the user supplied
**	    character string key.
**
**	    To build a vms key, we prepend "II_", then the 2-letter installation
**	    code, then "_" and then the user key.
**
**	    Since there is no way on VMS for a program to query the system to
**	    find out what shared segments exist, ME must keep track of all
**	    memory segments it creates in order for MEshow_pages to work.
**
**	    Each time a shared segment is created, a file will be created in
**	    a subdirectory of II_CONFIG (II_CONFIG:[MEMORY]) that identifies
**	    that shared segment.  The filename will be the user supplied key
**	    name.  MEshow_pages will be able to list the contents of this
**	    directory to find existing memory segments.
**
**	    ME routines should note that the existence of such a file does not
**	    guarantee the existence of a corresponding shared memory segment
**	    (however the reverse is guaranteed to be true).

/*{
** Name: MEget_pages  - add (possibly shared) memory to the client
**
** Description:
**
**      This routine adds pages to the virtual address space of the requesting
**	program. This routine is intended to be used by the dbms server for all
**	dynamic memory allocation.  It adds pages which are ME_MPAGESIZE bytes 
**	in length, and are guaranteed to be aligned on ME_MPAGESIZE byte 
**	boundaries.
**
**	Implementor's of the ME module can assume that MEget_pages will be
**	the exclusive allocator of memory when MEadvise(ME_INGRES_ALLOC).
**
**      This routine allocates some number of pages.  The memory 
**      allocated here is considered to be long-term memory (on the order
**      of session or server length of time).  All memory returned by this 
**      service is page (ME_MPAGESIZE bytes) aligned, and the unit of measuring
**      of this memory is pages (i.e. requests come in for number of pages, 
**      not number of bytes).  Note that this page size must be variable
**	from environment to environment.  This is necessary to adjust for
**	environmental performance differences in paging activity.
**
**	When allocating shared memory, even more restrictive conditions
**	may apply, e.g.
**(	  1) the allocation size being greater
**	  2) the alignment boundaries are further apart
**	  3) only specific regions of the address space	can support shared
**	     segments.
**)
**	The various restrictions on shared memory are derived from a machine's
**	hardware architecture and the operating system's allocation primitives.
**	Because these restrictions are so varied, MEget_pages is not allowed
**	during MEadvise(ME_USER_ALLOC).  See 'OUTSTANDING ISSUES' above.
**
**	Attaching to a shared segment is performed by specifying either
**	ME_MSHARED_MASK or ME_SSHARED_MASK in the flags argument and by not
**	specifying ME_CREATE_MASK.  When attaching to an already existing
**	shared segment the user supplied 'pages' argument is ignored, the
**	user recieves all the pages that belong to the shared segment. This
**	number is returned in the 'allocated_pages' parameter.
**
**	When creating or attaching to shared memory segments, a key parameter
**	must be specified which uniquely identifies this shared segment within
**	the current Ingres Installation.  The key parameter is a character
**	string that must follow the Ingres file naming conventions: 
**	"prefix.suffix" where prefix is at most 8 characters and suffix is
**	at most 3.  All characters must be printable.  ME may use this key
**	to create a file to identify the shared memory segment, although this
**	is up to the particular implementation of ME.
**
** Inputs:
**      flag                            Flag specifying special operations on
**					allocated memory. (advisorys)
**					Can be or'ed together.
**		    ME_NO_MASK		None of the other flags apply.
**                  ME_MZERO_MASK       zero the memory before returning
**		    ME_MERASE_MASK	"erase" the memory (DoD) 
**					 ...on systems where applicable
**		    ME_IO_MASK		Memory used for I/O
**		    ME_SPARSE_MASK	Memory used `sparsely' so should
**					be paged in small chunks if applicable
**		    ME_LOCKED_MASK	Memory should be locked down to inhibit
**					paging -- i.e. buffer caches.
**		    ME_SSHARED_MASK	Memory shared across processes on a
**					single machine
**		    ME_MSHARED_MASK	Memory shared with other processors.
**		    ME_CREATE_MASK	Create a new shared memory segment.
**					(Usually specified with ME_MZERO_MASK)
**					It is an error if the specified segment
**					already exists.
**		    ME_NOTPERM_MASK	Create temporary shared memory segment
**					rather than a permanent one (on systems
**					where this is supported).
**
**		    The flags ME_SSHARED_MASK, ME_MSHARED_MASK cannot both be
**		    specified in an MEget_pages call.  One of these flags must
**		    be specified in order for ME_CREATE_MASK or ME_NOTPERM_MASK
**		    flags to be used.
**
**      pages                           number of pages requested
**					NOTE: if attaching to an already
**					    existing shared memory segment,
**					    the pages argument is ignored.
**
**	key				A character string identifier for the
**					a shared memory segment.  This argument
**					is only requried with shared memory
**					operations - when not needed, use NULL.
**
**					The key identifier should be a character
**					string that follows the Ingres file
**					naming conventions: 8 characters max
**					prefix name and 3 characters max suffix.
**
** Outputs:
**
**	memory				Upon success the address of the
**					allocated memory.
**	allocated_pages			Number pages of shared memory returned.
**					Normally, this will always match the
**					'pages' input parameter.  If attaching
**					to an existing shared memory segment,
**					this will give the actual size of the
**					attached segment.
**	err_code			System specific error information.
**
**	Returns:
**		OK			If all went well.
**					Otherwise, set to: 
**		ME_OUT_OF_MEM		Could not allocate required amount of 
**					memory.
**
**		ME_BAD_PARAM		Illegal parameter passed to routine
**					(pages <= 0, ...)
**
**		ME_ILLEGAL_USAGE	Combination of attributes is invalid
**
**		ME_BAD_ADVISE		call was made during ME_USER_ALLOC.
**
**		ME_ALREADY_EXISTS	shared memory identifier already exists
**
**		ME_NO_SUCH_SEGMENT	specified shared memory segment does
**					not exist
**		ME_NO_SHARED		system can not support shared memory
**
**	Exceptions:
**	    none

** Name: MEfree_pages()	- Free pages back to OS
**
** Description:
**	Routine will, if possible, return pages to OS.  Memory to be freed
**	must have been allocated using the MEget_pages() call.  Memory to
**	be freed need not be exact extent allocated by a MEget_pages() call
**	(for example one MEfree_pages() call can be used to free memory 
**	allocated by two MEget_pages() calls assuming the memory was 
**	contiguous; or one could free half of the memory allocated by a single
**	MEfree_pages() call.)
**
**	Note: The memory might not be freed immediately.  On Unix, memory
**	must be contiguous and freed in LIFO order.  Thus the memory will not
**	returned to the OS until all memory above it is also freed.
**
**	Shared Memory Note: Shared memory often must be released in an
**	all-or-nothing manner so again the actual release may be postponed.
**
** Inputs:
**      address                         address of the 1st allocated block of 
**					memory to be freed.
**      num_of_pages                    number of pages to be freed.
**
** Outputs:
**      err_code                        system dependent error code.
**
**	Returns:
**	    OK				Free operation succeeded.
**	    ME_BAD_PARAM		Parameter is invalid
**	    ME_NOT_ALLOCATED		Pages to be freed were not allocated
**	    ME_OUT_OF_MEM		should never happen (OS
**						doesn't want memory back)

**
**	The routine takes a function parameter - 'func' - that will be
**	called once for each existing shared memory segment allocated
**	by Ingres in the current installation.
**
**      The client specified function must have the following call format:
**(

**)
**
**	The following return values from the routine 'func' have special
**	meaning to MEshow_pages:
**
**	    OK (zero)	- If zero is returned from 'func' then MEshow_pages
**			  will continue normally, calling 'func' with the
**			  next shared memory segment.
**	    ENDFILE	- If ENDFILE is returned from 'func' then MEshow_pages
**			  will stop processing and return OK to the caller.
**
**	If 'func' returns any other value, MEshow_pages will stop processing
**	and return that STATUS value to its caller.  Additionally, the system
**	specific 'err_code' value returned by 'func' will be returned to the
**	MEshow_pages caller.
**
** Inputs:
**	func			Function to call with each shared segment.
**	arg_list		Optional pointer to argument list to pass
**				to function.
**
