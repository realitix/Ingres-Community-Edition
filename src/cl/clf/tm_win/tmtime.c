/**
** Name: TMTIME.C - Functions used by the TM CL module.
**
** Description:
**      This file contains the following tm routines:
**    
**      TMzone()        -  Return minutes of time wes of Greenwich.
**      TMnow()         -  Return seconds and milliseconds since 
**			   00:00:00 GMT, 1/1/1970.
** History:
**      20-jul-87 (mmm)
**          Updated to meet jupiter coding standards.      
**	10-nov-87 (mikem)
**          Initial integration of 6.0 changes into 50.04 cl to create 
**          6.0 baseline cl
**	06-jan-88 (anton)
**          tmlocal.h moved
**	05-aug-88 (roger)
** 	    UNIX 6.0 Compatibility Library as of 12:23 p.m. August 5, 1988.
**	10-aug-88 (jeff)
** 	    added daveb's fixs for non-bsd
**	28-Feb-1989 (fredv)
**	    Include <systypes.h>.
**	1-sep-89 (daveb)
**	    Quite a bit of DBMS code assumes that TMnow is going to return
**	    a unique id.  That's what TMtimestamp is for, but apparently
**	    it isn't used as widely as it should be.  So, we'll write this
**	    in terms of TMget_stamp, which happens to work because we know
**	    what TMget_stamp is really doing.
**	02-feb-90 (mikem)
**	    Added TMet() for performance debugging.  This is an internal to the
**	    UNIX CL and is not part of the official interface. 
**	29-may-90 (blaise)
**	    Integrated changes from ingresug:
**		Change the method of testing whether daylight saving time is
**		currently in operation. Now call localtime() and use the value
**		of tm_isdst which it returns.
**	27-june-90 (jkb)
**	    remove backslash to continue to new line the compiler complains
**	    about it.
**	15-jul-93 (ed)
**	    adding <gl.h> after <compat.h>
**	20-apr-94 (mikem)
**          Added use of 2 new #defines (xCL_GETTIMEOFDAY_TIMEONLY and
**          xCL_GETTIMEOFDAY_TIME_AND_TZ) to describe 2
**          versions of gettimeofday() available.
**      30-Nov-94 (nive)
**              For dg8_us5, chnaged the prototype definition for
**              gettimeofday to gettimeofday ( struct timeval *, struct
**              timezone * )
**	32-may-95 (emmag)
**	    Desktop porting changes. 
**	18-jul-95 (canor01)
**	    semaphore protect globals for MCT only
**      06-aug-1999 (mcgem01)
**          Replace nat and longnat with i4.
**	13-sep-2009 (zhayu01) SIR 121210
**	    Adopt it for Windows CE/Pocket PC.
**	23-Nov-2010 (kschendel)
**	    Kind of silly to have unix platform tests in win-only source, fix.
**      13-Jul-2011 (hanal04) SIR 125458
**          Update cs_elog calls inline with sc0e_putAsFcn changes.

** Name: TMzone	- Return minutes to Greenwich
**
** Description:
**	Local time zone (in minutes of time westward from Greenwich).

**	INGRES session.
**
**	On systems without gettimeofday (sysV), uses the externs
**	timezone, and daylight.

** Outputs:
**      zone                            local time zone in minutes

**	Exceptions:
**	    none.

** Side Effects:
**	    none.

** History:

**          initial creation
**      06-jul-1987 (mmm)
**          Updated for jupiter unix cl.
**	28-Jul-1988 (daveb)
**	    Eliminate FTIME ifdef.  Note that the whole concept of TMzone
**	    is fatally flawed, since it assumes that the timezone correction
**	    we are returning is correct for all time.  In fact, it is only
**	    correct for "now".  It needs two more arguments, the time to be
**	    corrected, and the timezone.  (In a server, we can't assume that
**	    the timezone of the server process is right for the thread that
**	    is running the query.).
**	07-mar-89 (russ)
**	    Changed ifdef BSD42 to the more general xCL_005_GETTIMEOFDAY_EXISTS
**	    define.
**	27-june-90 (jkb)
**	    remove backslash to continue to new line the compiler complains
**	    about it.
**	20-apr-94 (mikem)
**	    Changed TMzone() to use new ifdef "xCL_GETTIMEOFDAY_TIME_AND_TZ".
**	    Only on systems where gettimeofday exists and it correctly supports
**	    time zone information will it be used.
