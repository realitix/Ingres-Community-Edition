/*{
** Name: TMyrsize	- days in year
**
** Description:
**	Routine returns the number of days in a normal year (365)
**	if "year" is not a leap year.  366 is returned for a leap
**	year.  This routine assumes the English calendar;  before
**	1752, the Julian scheme was followed, meaning that every
**	4th year was a leap year.  After 1752, century years that
**	are not divisible by 400 are NOT leap years.
**	This scheme is extended backwards to year 1, however dubious
**	that might be.
**
**	Note that we DO NOT return the actual number of days in 1752.
**	It was a leap year, and we return 366.
**
**	Will signal a BAD_YEAR exception if year is less than zero (0).
**
** Inputs:
**      year                            year (larger than 0)
**
** Outputs:
**      days                            number of days in year
**	Returns:
**	    OK or FAIL if year < 0
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	    none
**
** History:
**      15-sep-86 (seputis)
**          initial creation
**	06-jul-87 (mmm)
**	    initial jupiter cl.

**	    Fix for date extensions prior to 1752.
