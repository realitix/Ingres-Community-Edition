/**
** Name: TMTIME.C - Functions used by the TM CL module.
**
** Description:
**      This file contains the following tm routines:
**    
**      TMzone()        -  Return minutes of time wes of Greenwich.
**      TMnow()         -  Return seconds and milliseconds since 
**			   00:00:00 GMT, 1/1/1970.
** History:
**      20-jul-87 (mmm)
**          Updated to meet jupiter coding standards.      
**	10-nov-87 (mikem)
**          Initial integration of 6.0 changes into 50.04 cl to create 
**          6.0 baseline cl
**	06-jan-88 (anton)
**          tmlocal.h moved
**	05-aug-88 (roger)
** 	    UNIX 6.0 Compatibility Library as of 12:23 p.m. August 5, 1988.
**	10-aug-88 (jeff)
** 	    added daveb's fixs for non-bsd
**	28-Feb-1989 (fredv)
**	    Include <systypes.h>.
**	1-sep-89 (daveb)
**	    Quite a bit of DBMS code assumes that TMnow is going to return
**	    a unique id.  That's what TMtimestamp is for, but apparently
**	    it isn't used as widely as it should be.  So, we'll write this
**	    in terms of TMget_stamp, which happens to work because we know
**	    what TMget_stamp is really doing.
**	02-feb-90 (mikem)
**	    Added TMet() for performance debugging.  This is an internal to the
**	    UNIX CL and is not part of the official interface. 
**	29-may-90 (blaise)
**	    Integrated changes from ingresug:
**		Change the method of testing whether daylight saving time is
**		currently in operation. Now call localtime() and use the value
**		of tm_isdst which it returns.
**	27-june-90 (jkb)
**	    remove backslash to continue to new line the compiler complains
**	    about it.
**	15-jul-93 (ed)
**	    adding <gl.h> after <compat.h>
**	20-apr-94 (mikem)
**          Added use of 2 new #defines (xCL_GETTIMEOFDAY_TIMEONLY and
**          xCL_GETTIMEOFDAY_TIME_AND_TZ) to describe 2
**          versions of gettimeofday() available.
**      30-Nov-94 (nive)
**              For dg8_us5, chnaged the prototype definition for
**              gettimeofday to gettimeofday ( struct timeval *, struct
**              timezone * )
**      23-May-95 (walro03)
**              Reversed previous change (30-Nov-94).  A better way is to use
**              the correct prototype based on xCL_GETTIMEOFDAY_TIMEONLY vs.
**              xCL_GETTIMEOFDAY_TIME_AND_TZ.
**	07-Jun-95 (walro03)
**		Due to compile errors, removed change of 23-May-95.  Program
**		has compile errors on platforms with xCL_GETTIMEOFDAY_TIMEONLY.
**	22-jun-95 (allmi01)
**		Added dgi_us5 support for DG-UX on Intel based platforms following dg8_us5.
**	25-sept-95 (allmi01)
**		Fixed dgi_us5 support for changes made to DG-UX r4.10 fcs which hides tz_minuteswest and tz_dsttime
**		if not compile flags _KERNEL_SOURCE or  __bsd_tod for include/sys header time.h.
**	04-Dec-1995 (walro03/mosjo01)
**		Compile errors on DG/UX when # directive does not start in 
**		column 1.  Moved #ifdef, #else, #endif to col.1.
**	03-jun-1996 (canor01)
**	    Clean up semaphores used with operating-system threads.
**	29-jul-1997 (walro03)
**		Assorted compile, link, and runtime errors on Tandem NonStop
**		(ts2_us5) caused by useof _REENTRANT.  We must keep _REENTRANT
**		defined, but let's call the non-reentrant module.  Also moved
**		#if, #else, #endif to column 1.
**	14-Aug-1997 (toumi01)
**	    Move #ifdef etc. to column 1, as required by many compilers.
**      26-Aug-1997 (kosma01)
**              Added xCL_GETTIMEOFDAY_TIME_AND_VOIDPTR for rs4_us5,
**              to agree with arguments of gettimeofday() in <sys/time.h>.
**      09-sep-1998 (hweho01)
**              Extended the fix dated 25-sept-95 by allmi01 to dg8_us5. 
**	18-apr-1998 (canor01)
**	    Clean up use of _REENTRANT.  It was originally implemented as
**	    a placeholder for su4_us5, but somehow remained in the code, 
**	    causing problems on other platforms.
**	16-Nov-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    TMet() now called by CSMTsuspend for timed waits. Faults
**	    in code was causing 2 gettimeofday()'s to be executed,
**	    TM_msecs wasn't being set correctly.
**	22-Nov-1998 (kosma01)
**		Used existing xCL_GETTIMEOFDAY_TIMEONLY_V for sgi_us5.
**		This allows local prototype of gettimeofday to agree with
**		gettimeofday() prototype in <sys/time.h>.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	17-Oct-2002 (bonro01)
**	    Corrected invalid comment on endif line, that was causing
**	    compiler warnings.
**      15-Mar-2005 (bonro01)
**          Added support for Solaris AMD64 a64_sol.
**	22-Jun-2009 (kschendel) SIR 122138
**	    Use any_aix, sparc_sol, any_hpux symbols as needed.
**	23-Nov-2010 (kschendel)
**	    Drop obsolete ports.
**      13-Jul-2011 (hanal04) SIR 125458
**          Update cs_elog calls inline with sc0e_putAsFcn changes.

**          Updated for jupiter unix cl.
**	28-Jul-1988 (daveb)
**	    Eliminate FTIME ifdef.  Note that the whole concept of TMzone
**	    is fatally flawed, since it assumes that the timezone correction
**	    we are returning is correct for all time.  In fact, it is only
**	    correct for "now".  It needs two more arguments, the time to be
**	    corrected, and the timezone.  (In a server, we can't assume that
**	    the timezone of the server process is right for the thread that
**	    is running the query.).
**	07-mar-89 (russ)
**	    Changed ifdef BSD42 to the more general xCL_005_GETTIMEOFDAY_EXISTS
**	    define.
**	27-june-90 (jkb)
**	    remove backslash to continue to new line the compiler complains
**	    about it.
**	20-apr-94 (mikem)
**	    Changed TMzone() to use new ifdef "xCL_GETTIMEOFDAY_TIME_AND_TZ".
**	    Only on systems where gettimeofday exists and it correctly supports
**	    time zone information will it be used.
**	23-may-95 (tutto01)
**	    Changed localtime call to the reentrant localtime_r.
**	23-Sep-2005 (hanje04)
**	    Quiet compiler warnings
