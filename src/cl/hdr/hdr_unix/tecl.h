** te.h
**
** Header file for Terminal I/O Compatibility library for
** Berkeley UNIX.
**
** Created 2-15-83 (dkh)
** Modified 8-9-85 (joe)
**	Changed input from stdin to IIte_fpin to prepare for TEswitch.
** 14-oct-87 (bruceb)
**	Added typedef of TEENV_INFO.
** 10-mar-89 (bruceb)
**	Added define of TE_TIMEDOUT, for support of timeout.
** 25-may-89 (mca)
**	Added constants used by the "new" TEtest to distinguish SEP-based
**	TCFILEs from regular FILEs.
** 23-may-90 (blaise)
**	Integrated changes from 61 and ingresug:
**	    Include systypes.h so u_char, u_short, etc. don't get redefined.
**	11/29/90 (dkh) - Added declaration of TEget().
**	7-jun-93 (ed)
**	    created glhdr version contain prototypes, renamed existing file
**	    to xxcl.h and removed any func_externs
**	09-Jan-2001 (hanje04)
**	    Added Ingres defn TE_VMIN TE_VTIME for VMIN and VTIME because of
**	    bug 103708 on axp.lnx (Alpha Linux). For ALL other platforms these 
**	    will be defined as system defines VMIN and VTIME.
**	17-aug-2001 (somsa01 for fanra01)
**	    SIR 104700
**	    Add TE_IO_MODE for direct stream I/O.
**	24-Feb-2002 (hanch04)
**	    Moved TE_ECHOON and TE_ECHOOFF from te.h to tecl.h

** Name:	TEENV_INFO	- Terminal environment information.
**
** Description:
**	Terminal environment information.  Used by TEopen to return
**	information to the calling routine.  Currently contains
**	a delay constant and the number of rows and columns on
**	the terminal screen.  If rows (or cols) is zero (0), use
**	the value obtained by looking up TERM_INGRES in the termcap
**	file.  If rows (or cols) is greater than zero, then use this
**	value instead of the one obtained from termcap.  If rows
**	(or cols) is negative, then the absolute value is used to
**	indicate the number of rows (or cols) made unavailable to
**	the forms runtime system (i.e., subtract from termcap value).
**
**	Caveat:  This structure is not intended to be used for dynamically
**	re-sizing the forms system window size at runtime.
**	
** History:
**	25-sep-87 (bab)
**		Created for use in TEopen.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
