** Name: CS.H - Control System CL Module Global Header
**
** Description:
**      This file contains define's and datatype definitions
**      for the Ingres Compatibilty Library/Control System
**      Module.  This module contains those routines which
**      are used to control the activity in a multithreaded
**      server environment.  The structures defined here are
**      originally being designed for use in a multithreaded
**      DBMS Server;  however, an attempt is being made to define
**      the system such that this code could be used to control
**      other types of multithreaded servers, specifically thinking
**      in terms of uses for terminal servers in Online Transaction
**      Processing (OLTP) systems.
**
** Specification:
**  
**  Description:
** 
**	This CLF module provides a Control System (CS) for controlling
**	multiple threads of activity within a session.  The CS module allows
**	multiple threads of execution to share the machine cycles in a
**	priority-based manner under control of the INGRES system.
**
**	The CS module can be easily implemented to support the degenerate
**	case of a single thread of execution in systems which encourage
**	such a model.
**
**  Intended Uses:
**
**	The initial purpose of the CS module is to provide support for
**	multithreading of the DBMS.  However, the CS module has been
**	designed so the interface to the module will work equally well
**	with other Ingres applications.  Thus, it would be possible to use
**	the CS module to build a multiterminal server for the Ingres frontends.
**      
**    Assumptions:
**
**	It is assumed that the notion of a multithreaded server is
**	understood.  The CS module provides the capability to support
**	such an object.
**
**	It is assumed that the notion of a semaphore is understood.
**	(Reference: "Operating Systems," Madnick, Stuart E., & Donovan,
**	John J., McGraw-Hill Book Co., 1974.)
**
**	When CS is providing full services, the CS module assumes that
**	the system provides the following capabilities.  Implementation
**	platforms may choose to implement less than a full service
**	CS module.
**
**(	    Timer Based Interrupts:
**		The CS module makes use of the system's timers to
**		provide time-sliced execution of threads within a 
**		priority.  CS does not require the use of time-sliced
**		execution.  Implementation platforms may choose not to
**		provide this capability and have all threads "voluntarily"
**		give up the CPU periodically.
**
**	    Asynchronous Event Completion:
**		The CS module provides interface points to allow
**		a thread to suspend itself while awaiting the completion
**		of a system event.  Once again, implementation platforms
**		may choose to use polling to determine the completion
**		events in environments where asynchrony is less convenient.
**
**	    Uninterrupted Processing Mode:
**		The CS module must occasionally run in a mode during
**		which it is not informed of asynchronous event completion.
**		These periods of time are short, but required nonetheless.
**)
**	When the CS module is configured to run in the degenerate case described
**	above, these assumptions can be relaxed.
**
**	It is assumed that the remainder of the Compatibility Library and,
**	indeed, of INGRES, is modified to use the features provided by the
**	CS module.  Alone, the CS module cannot provide full multi-threaded
**	server capability.  It expects that the other CL modules which interact
**	with the system cooperate with it.  This means, primarily, that the
**	other CL modules make the appropriate suspend & resume calls on
**	behalf of the current thread as necessary.  For example, the DI module
**	of the CL is expected to be built such that I/O requests inform the
**	system that the resume (CSresume()) routine is to be called at the
**	completion of the I/O, and then the DI module, having requested an
**	asynchronous I/O, should call the suspend routine (CSsuspend()).
**	Thus, DIread() may be coded (details removed for the sake of clarity)
**	as
**(	    DIread(...)
**	    {
**		preprocessing...
**		status_of_queuing =
**			system_io_request(parms..., CSresume, session_id);
**		if (status_of_queuing != successful)
**		{
**		    process error and return;
**		}
**		status = CSsuspend(...);
**		postprocessing...
**	    }
**)
**    Definitions/Concepts:
**
**	(Note:  In this context, it is important to remind the reader that,
**	independent of terms used elsewhere in RTI documentation, the terms
**	defined in the "CL Specification Guidelines" are in use here.
**	Thus, "session" refers to the System's (as defined in the aforementioned
**	document) concept of the invoking process, and that "thread"
**	is intended to refer to a line of activity within the session.
**	Thus, in some sense, "session" is to "system" as "thread" is
**	to "session.")
**
**	The CS module supports the multithreading of a number of similar
**	threads.  The threads all must run the same application code.
**	Applications are specified to the CS module as a set of functions
**	which are called by the CS module to accomplish the work of the
**	application.  These functions are specified as pointers to critical
**	entry points in the main application.  These entry points are
**(	    server initiation,
**	    communication routines (await thread request, reject thread request,
**				    disconnect threads, read thread, write
**				    thread, and out-of-band completion routine)
**	    thread processing,
**	    server termination,
**	    error logging,	and
**	    memory allocation.
**	
**	Each of these is called in a prescribed manner to perform their
**	various functions.
**
**	At the time the server is invoked, the specified server initiation
**	routine is called as
**	    status = (*server_initiation)(&CS_INFO_CB);
**	This routine is expected to perform whatever initiation is necessary
**	for the server being run.
**
**	As new threads are added (via the await_thread_request routine),
**	the thread processing routine is called
**	    status = (*thread_processing)(mode_of_operation,	-- see below
**					    &thread_control_block,
**					    &next_mode_of_operation);
**	where mode_of_operation & next_mode_of_operation are as specified
**	below.  Any status != OK results in thread termination.
**
**	When reading or writing are necessary,
**	    status = (*read_routine)(&thread_control_block, sync_boolean)
**			or
**	    status = (*write_routine)(&thread_control_block, sync_boolean)
**		(All communication routines are called using this
**		    paradigm.)
**	are called.  Status's here of OK result in normal processing;
**	if read returns E_CS001E_SYNC_COMPLETION, then it is assumed
**	that the read request already completed, and that no thread
**	suspension need take place.  Similarly, if write returns
**	E_CS001D_NO_MORE_WRITES, then no suspension for the write needs
**	to take place.  Note that the system is optimized on the assumption
**	that the server will do more write's than reads, so the normal
**	control flow is
**
**	    if (need to read)
**	    {
**		call read routine
**		if status != sync completion
**		    suspend
**	    }
**	    call processing routine
**	    if (need to write)
**	    {
**		do
**		{
**		    call write routine
**		    if status != no more writes
**			suspend
**		} while status == OK
**	    }
**
**	When time comes for the server to terminate,
**	    (*termination_routine)()
**)	is called to allow the system to run itself down as necessary.
**
**	Error logging is used to place errors encountered by the CS module
**	into the server error log.  Memory allocation is used to allocate and
**	deallocate the thread control blocks which are used by the CS module
**	and by the underlying application.  By changing these critical entry
**	points, the underlying application controlled by CS can be changed.
**
**	Threads are called with a mode of operation, which specifies the
**	activity which the thread is expected to perform, and returns with
**	a mode of operation which specifies what activity the thread expects
**	to perform next.  The possible modes of operations are:
**
**(	    CS_INITIATE -- Given to the processing routine to indicate that
**		a new thread is to be initiated.  Never returned to the
**		CS module.
**	    CS_INPUT -- Given to processing routine to indicate that input has
**		been supplied from the user.  Returned to the CS module to
**		indicate that more input is needed.
**	    CS_OUTPUT -- Given to the processing routine to indicate that
**		it is expected to be providing more output (i.e. it last
**		returned CS_OUTPUT).  Returned to the CS module to indicate
**		that the CS module should output the supplied buffer and
**		call the processing routine back.
**	    CS_EXCHANGE -- Never given to a processing routine.
**		Returned to the CS module to indicate that the module should
**		output the supplied buffer, and await an input message from
**		the user.
**	    CS_TERMINATE -- Given to the processing routine to indicate that
**		it should terminate the current thread.  Returned to the
**		CS module to indicate that the thread is to be terminated,
**		and that the CS module should call back the processing routine
**		with the CS_TERMINATE operation code.
**)
**	At thread initiation time, the thread is called to allow it to perform
**	whatever application specific actions are necessary.  After that,
**	the thread sets	its mode of operation.  Thus, normally, a DBMS thread
**	will return an operation mode of CS_INPUT, to indicate that the user
**	needs to supply a query.  Once so supplied, the DBMS will return
**	CS_OUTPUT until the query has been completed, at which point it
**	will return CS_EXCHANGE, to indicate that the output should be sent
**	and that the CS module should then await new input.  Once the user
**	sends a termination request, the DBMS would return an operation
**	mode of CS_TERMINATE, with which it will be called back.  Returned
**	modes from a called CS_TERMINATE are ignored.
**
**	The CS module provides the capability for the threads to interact
**	in the sharing of resources.  This is provided by having the
**	threads declare and use CS_SEMAPHORE's, which, when combined with the
**	'p' and 'v' operations described below, allow many threads to
**	cooperate in the sharing and utilization of software resources.
**
**	The CS module provides for the prioritized execution of threads
**	within the session.  As the session becomes ready to execute a
**	new thread, CS will pick the highest priority thread to execute.
**	Within a priority, the threads are picked in a "round robin"
**	fashion.  The scheduler is not currently intended to be preemptive;
**	that is, should a higher priority thread become ready, the lower
**	priority thread will be allowed to either complete its current
**	time quantum (see below) or be suspended when it so volunteers.
**
**	The CS module provides for timesliced execution of the threads within
**	a session.  The time quantum can be selected by the system administrator
**	at a particular user site.  A provision can be made to disable this
**	feature, so that threads will be suspended only while awaiting a system
**	event completion.  (On VMS, this is done via the server startup
**	program.)
**
**	Threads volunteer to be suspended while awaiting the completion of some
**	system event.  They may also be suspended while awaiting a semaphore.
**	Each thread is allowed to be awaiting no more than one regular
**	event or semaphore at a time.  A provision is made to allow the thread
**	to be informed of an out-of-band I/O (for interrupts).
**
**	The CS module provides the following data structures.
**	The CS_SEMAPHORE is used to control access to shared data structures
**	within the session under software control.
**	The CS_SCB is the thread control block.  This structure is returned
**	to the CS module by the thread control block allocation routine passed
**	into the module.  It is expected that the actual thread control block
**	will be larger than that passed here;  however, the CS module will use
**	only the CS_SCB portion, and expects that it be at the returned address
**	of the allocated space.
**
**	Threads are added to the session as requested by the users.  The method
**	of attaching to the server will vary from system to system.  On VAX/VMS
**	systems, users will send a request to public mailbox to request such
**	an action.
**
**	As a thread is added to the session, the CS module will add the new
**	thread to its list of known threads.  The underlying application will
**	be called to initiate this thread, and operation will proceed as
**	described above.  The difference between the multithreaded nature
**	of, say, a VAX/VMS system and the single threaded nature of
**	another system should be entirely hidden within the CS module.
**	There is no reason for the underlying application to behave any
**	differently in these differing systems.
**
**	The CS module declares no global variables which are known outside
**	itself.  Internally, it may require varying support on each system.
**
**  Possible Futures:
**
**	Since the underlying application is fully specified at server startup,
**	the CS module needs to know nothing about how the underlying application
**	works.  However, at the moment, the method of communication from the
**	user to/from the server is known by the CS module (it currently uses 
**	IN/NT to transmit information between the user and the thread).
**	In the future, should it be the case that the company decides to build
**	servers from something other than DBMS's, the CS module should be easily
**	converted to the fully generalized model. (This has been done with GCF).
**
**	It may, at some point, be desirable for the CS module to allow each
**	thread to run different code.  This, in environments with which I am
**	familiar should not be too difficult.

** Name: CS_CB - Control System Request Control Block
**
** Description:
**      This routine is used to initiate the services of the CS module
**      of the system.  It contains the information necessary for the
**      dispatcher to correctly operate the server.  This information
**      includes the addresses of routines to call to allocate session
**      or thread control blocks, to deallocate SCB's, and the address
**      of a routine to perform main processing.  This routine is always
**      called with a standard parameter interface (see the CSdispatch()
**      routine header for details).
**
**      Also included is the adminstrative information needed to operate
**      the server.  This is primarily information about the maximum number
**      of sessions to allow, the maximum number of active sessions, and the
**      size of the stack needed for each active session for this type of
**      server.
**
** History:
**      24-Oct-1986 (fred)
**          Initial Definition.
**      14-Mch-1996 (prida01)
**          Add cs_diag call.
**	29-oct-1997 (canor01)
**	    Add cs_stkcache.
**	03-Dec-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Added cs_get_rcp_pid.
**	05-sep-2002 (devjo01)
**	    Added cs_format_lkkey to CS_CB.
**	12-Nov-2010 (kschendel) SIR 124685
**	    Refine CS prototypes.
