 *			written
**	7-jun-93 (ed)
**	    created glhdr version contain prototypes, renamed existing file
**	    to xxcl.h and removed any func_externs
**	27-oct-1998 (canor01)
**	    Add definition of uuid_t for those systems that do not have it
** 	    already defined.
**	07-nov-1998 (canor01)
**	    Add RPC_S_OK and RPC_S_UUID_LOCAL_ONLY for those systems that
**	    do not have them already defined.
**	29-Mar-2005 (hanje04)
**	   BUG 112987
**	   Add IDgeteuser(). Similar to IDname but just a wrapper for 
**	   cuserid.
**	13-Apr-2005 (hanje04)
**	   BUG 112987
**	   cuserid() doesn't return the same thing on Solaris as it does
**	   on Linux. Use IDename instead.
**	15-Apr-2005 (hanje04)
**	   BUG 112987
**	   Use IDename on Linux too, cuserid is causing problem using 
**	   usernames over 7 characters. Removed macro, IDename is called
**	   directly 
**      28-apr-2005 (raodi01)
**          Following the UUID change for Bug b110668 which was a 
**	    windows-specific one
**          added changes to handle the change on unix
**	08-Oct-2007 (hanje04)
**	   BUG 114907
**	   The system defined uuid_t bares very little resemblence to that
**	   which is needed so remove the #ifdef uuid_t section and always
**	   define UUID to be GUID.
