/**CL_SPEC
** Name: DI.H - This file contains the external structs for DI.
**
** Description:
**      The DI.H file is used to contain all structures and 
**      definitions required to call the compatability library
**      DI routines.  These routines perform all direct file
**      I/O for all database files, such as database tables,
**      configuration files, etc.  It is not meant to be used for
**      such operations as copying tables to user files, the 
**      stream I/O(SI) routines are used for this.  The main
**      structure used to keep track of operating system information
**      needed to perform the I/O is called DI_IO and is defined
**      below.  This structure varies significantly depending
**      on the operating system.
**
** Specification:
**  
**  Description:
**	Direct file I/O for shared files. These files have the following
**	extensions:
**
**               .cnf  - For configuration file.
**               .tab  - For all database files.
**               .d##  - For all files waiting to be deleted.
**                       If any of these are left around 
**                       while a database is not in use they
**                       can be deleted.
**               .m##  - The new  database file as a result of
**                       a modify.  If modify is successfull, then
**                       at the end it is changed to the .tab extention
**                       identifier.  If any of these are left 
**                       around while a database is not in use, they
**                       can be deleted.
**               .ali  - Detects aliasing of locations during 
**                       checkpointing.  This is a temporary table
**                       and can be deleted if left around while 
**                       a database is not in use.
**               .ovl  - The overflow pages during the modify to
**		         ISAM.  If modify is successfull, then at
**                       the end it is deleted.  If any of these are
**                       left around while a database is not in use,
**                       they can be deleted.
**               .sm1  - During a sysmod, a table is temporarily 
**                       rename to a .sm1 file name.
**               .sm2  - During a sysmod, an index table is temporarily 
**                       rename to a .sm2 file name.
**                          
** 
**  Intended Uses:
**      DI is used to create, delete,  and maintain the files used 
**      by the DBMS to store the data associated with INGRES Databases.  
**      This includes all files associated with system and user tables 
**      and the database configuration file.  All these files are 
**      shared resources amoung users and processes.  No serialization
**      of calls can be expected.  For example you maybe trying
**      to open a file for one caller and be interrupted to open
**      a file for another caller.  The DI code must be able to 
**      handle this.  The DI routines
**      provide a direct access mechanism for accessing data in blocks.
**      It is a requirement of DI files that they can be created and 
**      openeed with the same block size.  Host operating systems 
**      which can check this should.  If they don't match it should
**      return DI_BADPARAM.
**      These routines are designed to provide enough functionality 
**      to insure that the data in the files can be recovered in case 
**      of system crashes or database recovery.  
**
**      Recovery also depends on a file system
**      capable of insuring the integrity of disk space structures used
**      to implement the file system.  For example, VAX/VMS must insure
**      all directory updates are atomic. DI is intended to be used only by DMF
**      and the database support routines such as CreateDB, DestroyDB,
**      VerifyDB, RecoverDB, etc.  No other part of the DBMS 
**      should be a client of the DI module.
**      
**    Assumptions:
**      It is assumed that the concept of a random access shared file
**      is understood.  The System is assumed to have some kind of
**      file system or disk I/O mechanism that DI is built on top of.  
**
**      In addition, it is assumed that the DI routines contain enough
**      functionality to insure that the main client DMF does not have
**      to have any machine dependent code to insure the same results 
**      on all machines.  For example, with some operating systems
**      all pages are physically on disk after a write operation
**      completes.  Other operating systems may complete the request
**      without actually insuring the data is on disk.  For these systems
**      the DMF will use the DIforce call to insure all data is on disk
**      at critical points like end transaction.
**      
**    Definitions:
**
**    Concepts:
**
**      The DI routines are assumed to be built on top of System service
**      routines which allow  random access to data within a file
**      by addressing a specific byte of that data.  It also assumes that
**      data can be segmented into  blocks (usually the sector size of
**      the disk ) and that contiguous blocks can be accessed as pages.
**      The basic unit of access for the DI routines is a page.  The page
**      size is set at creation time and must be openned with same size.
**      The first addressable page in a file
**      is always page 0.  For certain types of access (for example
**      read ahead) multiple pages will be accessed with one call of
**      the appropriate DI routines.  In these cases the pages must
**      be logically contiguous.
**
**      DI routines participate in guaranteeing the consistency of the
**      data.  For example the DIflush and DIforce calls exist to
**      guarantee the file header information and the data are on
**      disk prior to transaction commit, etc.   
**
**      All DI files are sharable.  That is more than one open 
**      of the file may exist at any one time for both reading
**      and writing.  (The user can pass an OPEN flag that says
**	that the file is explicitly not sharable, which can be
**	used to optimize certain operations.)
**
**      The DI routines must be reentrant, namely all information
**      that must be maintained between DI calls must be passed as
**      an argument.  To accomplish this all DI calls contain a 
**      pointer to a file context (of type DI_IO) which can be used to
**	contain any information needed for future calls.  For example the
**	System file identifier, the file allocation information such as 
**      physical end of file and logical end of file, etc.  Implementation
**      of the DI routines on different systems will have different file
**      context structures and often the file context will be ignored
**      on a specific call for a specific System.
**
**      All DI routines are responsible for providing in a structure
**      (of type CL_SYS_ERR) any operating system error that occurred
**      during execution.  It should be initialized to OK by all
**      DI routines.  This operating system error will be logged
**      by the ULF log utility routines.  The operating system errors
**      must also be converted to one of the following DI errors:
**	    
**		DI_OK           
**		DI_BADPARAM     
**		DI_BADFILE	
**		DI_ENDFILE      
**		DI_BADOPEN	
**		DI_BADCLOSE	
**		DI_BADWRITE	
**		DI_BADREAD	
**		DI_BADEXTEND	
**		DI_BADDIR	
**		DI_BADSEEK	
**		DI_BADSENSE	
**		DI_BADCREATE	
**		DI_BADDELETE    
**		DI_BADRENAME    
**              DI_NODISKSPACE
**              DI_EXCEED_LIMIT
**              DI_DIRNOTFOUND
**              DI_FILENOTFOUND
**              DI_EXISTS
**      
**	Before I/O operations can be performed on a file the file
**      must exist.  If it does not exist it must be created.  The
**      DIcreate routine only creates the file, it does not allocate
**      any physical storage or open it.  Effectively it creates an
**      entry in a directory.  After the initial creation, the file
**      can be opened by the DIopen call.  A file is created or opened
**      by name.  The name has two parts, the pathname (directory tree)
**      and the filename.  A pathname to DI is a pathname recognized by
**      the System.  A pathname can be up to DI_PATH_MAX characters.
**	Any DI call being passed a pathname will also be passed its length.
**      The filename to DI is a filename recognized by the System.  A
**      filename can be up to DI_FILE_MAX characters including any file
**	type extension.  Any DI call being passed a filename will also 
**      be passed its length.  
**
**      The DI pathname is one created by calls to LOingpath and
**      usually has at least two parts, the physical location
**      string provided when a location is defined to accessdb.
**      For VAX/VMS this is usually a disk device name such 
**      as disk$data.  However it can be a rooted directory
**      name such as disk$data:[aaa.bbb.ccc.]. This string is
**      operating system dependent.  LOingpath adds to this
**      the operating system specific ingres name to create the entire
**      path name.  The VAX/VMS ingres name is [ingres.data.dbname]
**      which would create the path disk$data:[ingres.data.dbname]
**      or disk$data:[aaa.bbb.ccc.][ingres.data.dbname].  The 
**      maximum values for the pathname and filename are defined
**      with the constants DI_PATH_MAX and DI_FILENAME_MAX.
**
**      Once a file is opened it can be extended, read, written or
**      closed.  The DI routines to perform these operations determine
**      the specific file to access through a System file identifier
**      stored in the file context.  Each of these routines relies
**      on a valid file context to function properly.  The routines
**      used to maintain the file context are: 
**
**                  DIalloc - Extend the logical & physical file.
**		    DIflush - Force soft-allocated file size to disk.
**				(Allows DIsense after allocation.)
**                  DIforce - Force all pages held by System to disk.
**                  DIread  - Reads pages from the file.
**                  DIwrite - Writes  pages to the file.
**                  DIsense - Determine logical end of file.
**                 
**      Since you can DIread or DIwrite more than one page
**      these routines must be able to tell you if less than 
**      the number requested was written or read.  This is
**      done by returning DI_ENDFILE for these calls instead
**      of OK when the request cannot be satisfied.
**
**      The logical end of file is maintained through the use
**      of the DIsense, DIwrite, and DIalloc calls as follows:
**
**	   1.  DIsense on a freshly opened file will return some sort of
**	       logical EOF that will be at least as high as the highest
**	       page previously written or DIgalloc'ed, and may be as high
**	       as the highest page allocated with DIalloc.
**
**	   2.  As DIalloc's are done on an open file, DIsense will track
**	       the logical end-of-file.  This may be larger than the
**	       DIsense result after closing and opening the file.  I.E.
**	       DIsense can (but need not!) track page slots that are writable
**	       but not yet permanently written to disk.
**	       *Note* that on VMS you apparently have to DIflush
**	       before DIsense sees any allocations.  That is not the
**	       case on Unix or Windows, and indeed, DIflush is a no-op
**	       on unix.
**
**	   3.  The DI caller has to guarantee that there will not be
**	       concurrent DIalloc calls in different threads or servers,
**	       e.g. by use of file extend locks.  DI cannot protect
**	       itself against concurrent DIalloc's.  DI will however
**	       re-sense logical EOF as needed.  (In other words, it's
**	       OK to interleave DIalloc's in different servers, as long
**	       as they aren't actually concurrent.)
**	       Please note that this is NOT a guarantee that DIalloc
**	       will always do a sense!  It's up to DI to decide when a
**	       sense is needed, and the caller must not make assumptions.
**
**         4.  To restate an implication of #2, a DIalloc simply assures
**	       that a following DIwrite (or read!) will succeed.  It MAY
**	       allocate disk space, and MAY move sensed EOF, but it
**	       need not.  Callers have to be prepared for either
**	       eventuality.  If DIalloc DOES move sensed EOF, it is
**	       guaranteed that pages allocated but unwritten will read
**	       as zero, even if the file is closed and re-opened.
**
**	Another way to state the same rules:
**	1.  You can read anywhere up to EOF.  You can write anywhere up
**	    to end-of-allocation.  The two can be different.
**
**	2.  Hard allocations (DIgalloc) and actual writes will move EOF.
**	    Soft allocations (DIalloc) only move end-of-allocation.  Soft
**	    allocations *might* move EOF but need not.
**
**	3.  Any page that can be read that hasn't been explicitly written
**	    must read back as zeros.
**
**	Any caller outside of the CL must assume that file space must
**	be pre-allocated before writing it.  (CL facilities such as SR
**	might cheat, and take advantage of platform specifics such as
**	extend-on-write, but outsiders may not.)
**
**	Any caller outside of the CL must assume that DIalloc causes
**	the results of a DIsense to be undefined until a DIflush is done.
**
**	The outcome of DIalloc can be a bit fuzzy, so for files that
**	demand a known persistent EOF, DI provides the DIgalloc and
**	DIguarantee_space calls.  DIgalloc is a hard allocation that
**	guarantees that a crash/open/sense will see the allocated
**	space.  On some (most?) platforms, DIgalloc has to actually
**	write out zeros, which is wasteful if real data is to be
**	written on top.  The DIguarantee_space call alleviates that problem.
**	DIguarantee_space is "galloc unwritten alloc'ed space if needed".
**	In other words, if you DIalloc N pages, and write M<N pages,
**	you can DIguarantee_space the remaining N-M pages and they will
**	become guaranteed sense'able and zero on disk.
**
**	DIforce and DIflush sound similar, but are not.  DIforce is
**	meant to be "guarantee that written data is on disk".
**	DIflush is meant to be "ensure that allocated space is visible
**	on disk and DIsense is valid again".
**
**      When you are finished with a file it must be closed with a
**      call to DIclose.  If the file is no longer needed it should
**      be deleted with a call to DIdelete.  You cannot delete a 
**      file that is open.  A delete call can be made while the file 
**      is opened, but the file will not be deleted until all 
**      opened contexts on this file are closed.  It is not possible
**      to open a file that has been marked for deletion.  Any other
**      user who has the file open already may perform all other
**      operations (such as sense, alloc, read, write, close).  
**      A file that is marked for deletion cannot be renamed.
**      A delete of a file is not associated with any open or open
**      context.  The close call uses the System identifier in the
**      file context to determine which file to close, the delete
**      is done by name.  A System path and file name must be passed
**      to the delete routine.  In order to support recovery of certain
**      file operations it is sometimes necessary to delay deletion
**      of a file to after transaction commit.  These files are 
**      often renamed until they can be deleted.  Therefore there is
**      a DIrename routine.  The file must be closed to rename it.
**
**      The other DI routines are needed to create paths (directories)
**      and destroy paths (directories) for the CreateDB and DestroyDB
**      support routines.  These DI routines are:
**
**	    DIdircreate - Creates a directory.
**	    DIdirdelete - Deletes a directory.
**	    DIlistdir   - List all directories in a directory.
**          DIlistfiles - List all files in a directory.
**
**	For the DIdircreate and DIcreate routines a check is
**      made to see if the object already exists.  If it does
**      either the DI_DIRNOTFOUND or DI_FILENOTFOUND must be
**      returned as errors.  DIlistdir and DIlistfiles must
**      return DI_ENDFILE when it finds the last object in 
**      a directory.
**
**	DI presents the fiction of allowing an unlimited number of
**	files to be open simultaneously.  DI opens and closes files
**	invisibly to maintain this fiction.  Callers must not assume
**	that a file remains open at the operating system level for
**	the entire duration that the file is opened in DI.
**    
**	The concept of physical file ownership for such purposes
**      as operating system accounting and quota must be handled
**      by DIcreate and DIdircreate.  If a particular operating 
**      system requires that the files be owned by the user running 
**      at the time of the create the DI routines must use
**      the appropriate calls to CS to determine who is running,
**      set appropriate user id to this user and then make the
**      operating system call so the file is associated with
**      the user instead of the process.  This insures that in 
**      a server process the ingres user does not own
**      all the tables it creates. 
**      
**      To allow for multiple locations for one table (i.e. 
**      table spread across multiple filesystems) two new
**      constants have been added to DI.  DI_EXTENT_SIZE is
**      the number of pages to be written to each disk before
**      writing to the next disk.  For example if DI_EXTENT_SIZE 
**      is four and there are three locations, the logical pages
**      0-24 would be allocated as follows:
**               Location 0  Pages 0,1,2,3,  12,13,24,15
**               Location 1  Pages 4,5,6,7,  16,17,18,19
**               Location 2  Pages 7,8,9,10, 11,12,13,14
**      
**      The DI_EXTENT_SIZE must be a power of two to make the 
**      calculations for determining where to write a logical 
**      page simple.  There is an additional constant used
**      in these calculations which is log2 of the extent 
**      size and is used in shifting.  The constant is 
**      DI_LOG2_EXTENT_SIZE.
**	** Note ** This constant is grossly mis-named and mis-placed
**	because DI does not do multi-locations at all.  It's up to
**	higher levels to deal with multiple locations.

** Name: DI_UNIQUE_ID - unique per-server identifier for DI file
**
** Description:
**	The DI_UNIQUE_ID is generated by the DIopen call and is
**	stored internally in the DI_IO struct.  It is used to optimize
**	the open file descriptor caching done by DI on UNIX systems.
**	The DI_UNIQUE_ID is simply a set of numbers assigned to a
**	path and filename at open-file time.  It is guaranteed that
**	no other file open'd in a server will have the same DI_UNIQUE_ID.
**	DIlru_uniq() an internal DI routine assigns these unique id's.

** Name: DI_IO - This is the I/O structure needed to do direct I/O.
**
** Description:
**      The DI_IO structure is used to contain all the operating
**      system dependent I/O information required for direct I/O.
**      It is very operating system specific.  The memory for this
**      structure is allocated by the caller of the DI routines.
**
**	There are two different mutexes in a DI_IO, io_sem and io_fd_q_sem.
**	Normally they are exclusive, ie if doing fd-per-thread, io_fd_q_sem
**	is used, else io_sem is used.  If both are taken for whatever
*	reason, the proper ordering is io_sem then io_fd_q_sem.
