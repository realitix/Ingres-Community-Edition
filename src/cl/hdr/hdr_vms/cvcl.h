/**
** Name: CV.H - Header for CV compatilibity library routines.
**
** Description:
**      The file contains the type used by CV and the definition of the
**      CV functions.  These are used for converting data types.
**
** History:
**      01-oct-1985 (derek)
**          Created new for 5.0.
**	14-nov-86 (thurston)
**	    Incorporated the CVNET.H file into this hdr file, so the user
**	    will not have to know about including TWO cl hdr files for CV.
**	    The following history records have been brought in from CVNET.H:
**	        31-jul-86 (ericj)
**	            Converted for Jupiter.
**	        16-sep-86 (neil)
**	            Added CV_FLTSZ from 5.0.
**	        13-nov-86 (thurston)
**	            Got rid of CV_FLOATSZ, as it conflicts with CV_FLOAT, and
**	            has been replaced with CV_FLTSZ.
**	17-apr-89 (jrb)
**	    Added FUNC_EXTERNs for new CV routines for DECIMAL.
**	20-jul-89 (jrb)
**	    Added new #defs for options to CVpka and changed its return value
**	    from VOID to STATUS.
**	7-jun-93 (ed)
**	    created glhdr version contain prototypes, renamed existing file
**	    to xxcl.h and removed any func_externs
**	22-Jul-1993 (daveb)
**	    add CV_DEC_PTR_SIZE and CV_HEX_PTR_SIZE defines.
**	20-Apr-04 (gordy)
**	    Moved network definitions to cvgcccl.h
**      14-Aug-2009 (horda03) B122474
**          Moved MAXDIGITS from cvfa.c and cvfcvt.c to here
**          and renamed to CV_MAXDIGITS (this was done on
**          UNIX in 1997). Also changed the value to 400
**          (again to mimic the Unix value), as the 308 value
**          was allowing buffer overrun with numbers >1.0e308
