/**
** Name:	mucl.h	- CL private interface for MU mutex functions.
**
** Description:
**	Defines the CL private interface to support the GL public
**	interface of the MU mutex module.  This interface permits
**	semaphore support in multi-threaded application environments.
**	Support for multi-threaded servers is provided through CS.
**
** History:
**	14-Nov-96 (gordy)
**	    Created.
**	12-dec-1996 (canor01)
**	    Make slightly more generic using existing CL macros for
**	    ease in porting.
**	01-dec-2000	(kinte01)
**	    Bug 103393 - removed nat, longnat, u_nat, & u_longnat
**	    from VMS CL as the use is no longer allowed
**      06-Apr-2007 (Ralph Loen) SIR 118032
**          Add CS_synch calls to VMS to support multi-threaded applications.
**          This file was cloned from the unix/windows version and can
**          be combined with that version when VMS fully supports
**          OS threading.
