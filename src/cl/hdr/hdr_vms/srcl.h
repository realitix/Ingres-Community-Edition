/**CL_SPEC
** Name: SR.H - This file contains the external structs for SR.
**
** Description:
**      The SR.H file is used to contain all structures and 
**      definitions required to call the compatability library
**      SR routines.  These routines perform all direct file
**      I/O for all sorts.  The main structure used to keep 
**      track of operating system information
**      needed to perform the I/O is called SR_IO and is defined
**      below.  This structure varies significantly depending
**      on the operating system.
**
** Specification:
**
**  Description:  
**	The SR routines perform all the direct file I/O for 
**      all sorts. The SR routines have been separated from the DI
**	routines, which perform direct I/O on shared files, to allow
**      easy modification of the sort package without affecting the DI
**	routines.  This also provides for special I/O handling to insure
**	that SORTs perform as fast as possible. It has also been separated
**	out in the hope that the entire sort package can be moved to the CL
**	to  provide a better way of implementing specialized sort packages
**	such as the ACCEL sorter with minimal changes to the DBMS code.  
**      
**  Intended Uses:
**	The SR routines are intended for the sole use of the SORT
**      routines in DMF.  
**      
**  Assumptions:
**(	The following assumptions apply to the SR routines:
**	    o  Files are not shared.
**          o  Files are temporary.
**          o  Files are created with a name but never opened by name.
**          o  Should be able to handle variable length I/O.  That is,
**	       multiple physical blocks can be as a single logical
**	       request as long as the logical request is a multiple of
**	       the physical block size.
**	    o  Sorting I/O must be as efficient as possible.
**)
**  Definitions:
**
**  Concepts:
**
**	The page size is determined at open.  The page size can vary from
**	4096 to 32768 in powers of 2.  The allocates must always be 
**      obtained in the maximum size of 32K to insure that the file
**      can be read even if it was written with 4K and read with 32K.
**      
** History:
**      30-sep-85 (jennifer)
**          Created new for 5.0.
**	27-jul-87 (rogerk)
**	    Added return code SR_EXCEED_LIMIT.
**	26-apr-1993 (bryanp)
**	    Prototyping code for 6.5.
**	7-jun-93 (ed)
**	    created glhdr version contain prototypes, renamed existing file
**	    to xxcl.h and removed any func_externs
**	01-dec-2000	(kinte01)
**	    Bug 103393 - removed nat, longnat, u_nat, & u_longnat
**	    from VMS CL as the use is no longer allowed
**	15-Oct-2009 (kschendel) SIR 122512
**	    Need an SR_BADPARAM error code.
