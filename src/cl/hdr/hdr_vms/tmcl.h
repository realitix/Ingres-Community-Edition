/**CL_SPEC
** Name TM.H - Global definitions for the TM compatibility library.
**
** Description:
**      The file contains the type used by TM and the definition of the
**      TM functions.  These are used for time manipulation.
**
** Specification:
**
**  Description:  
**	These new TM routines perform various time related functions.  There
**	are two types of times: timestamps and seconds.  A timestamp
**	is a high resolution clock sample.  Seconds are used to 
**	represent low resolution events and dates.
**      
**  Intended Uses:
**	The TM routines are intended for for use by anyone needing time
**	and/or date information.
**      
**  Assumptions:
**	A timestamp must fit into a 8-byte quantity.
**
**	The resolution of a timestamp must be finer than a second.
**      If a host operating system cannot support this, it should
**      fake a finer granularity that is quaranteed to be 
**      monotonically increasing within a single process.
**
**  Definitions:
**
**  Concepts:
**
**	The timestamp is probably just the raw value of the machines clock
**	register or the rare value of the software clock.  Some processing
**	might be needed to shrink it into 8-bytes, but currently this
**	doesn't seem to be a problem.
**
**	The conversion routines are used to display the timestamps, and
**	for comparing user given timestamps to internally stored timestamps.
**
**(	The format of the output/input string is fixed as:
**	    dd-mmm-yyyy hh:mm:ss (The space between the yyyy and hh can be
**				  ':' on input, so that it can be easy typed
**)				  on an INGRES command line.)
** History:
**      01-oct-1985 (jennifer)
**          Updated to codinng standard for 5.0.
**	08-jan-86 (jeff)
**	    Changed FUNC_EXTERN of TMcvtsecs to return STATUS instead of VOID.
**	    Same for TMyrsize and TMbreak.
**	7-jun-93 (ed)
**	    created glhdr version contain prototypes, renamed existing file
**	    to xxcl.h and removed any func_externs
**      8-jul-93 (ed)
**          move nested include protection to glhdr
**	16-mar-1999 (popri01)
**	    Add NANOPERSEC constant.
**	01-dec-2000	(kinte01)
**	    Bug 103393 - removed nat, longnat, u_nat, & u_longnat
**	    from VMS CL as the use is no longer allowed
**	23-oct-2003 (devjo01)
**	    Cross 103715 changes from UNIX CL.
**	14-jan-2009 (joea)
**	    Remove TMhrnow macro and implement as a function.  Add
**	    TM_GETTIME_ERR.
**      13-mar-2009 (stegr01)
**          Add a couple more defines of msec/nsecs for compatibility with
**          Unix variant
**      07-Apr-2011 (horda03) b125249
**          Changed TMhrnow to use clock_gettime (as per unix) so that
**          GMT is obtained without the need to manipulate local time
**          with the Ingres Timezone (as the Ingres TZ and the VMS TZ
**          could be different).
