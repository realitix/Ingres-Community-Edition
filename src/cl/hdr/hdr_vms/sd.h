/**CL_SPEC
** Name: SD.H - This file contains the external structs for SD.
**
** Description:
**      The SD.H file is used to contain all structures and 
**      definitions required to call the compatability library
**      SD routines.  These routines perform all Smart Disc
**      operations for INGRES, such as compiling a query and doing
**      the file access.
**
** Specification:
**  
** 
**  Description:
**  This is a definition of all new CL routines to be invoked, in 
**  conjunction with existing CL, to access a VME CAFS unit.  
**  
**  What Smart Disc requires is that the conditions for search be surfaced 
**  for use at the DI level. It will require optimiser changes to check 
**  whether SD can handle a particular search and if so 'compile' the 
**  query into a Task Specification Block (TSB) to be passed via 
**  DMF to what are essentially DI extensions.  
**  
**  The DI extensions then interrupt the normal open-read-close flow to 
**  make it open-setcondition-read-close. The benefit is that the read 
**  activity will read in only those tuples that match the condition with 
**  no mainframe cost (because it is done in the CAFS disc controller). 
**  The down side and complication factor is that CAFS cannot handle 
**  every condition that SQL might care to throw at a table, is read 
**  only, and needs to do locking at the table and not page/record 
**  level.
**
**  The CL interface requires CL to tell mainline what CAFS is capable 
**  of and mainline makes the CAFS/no-CAFS decision. A lower level interface 
**  is then provided which takes a form of the condition/table info which 
**  is suitable for generating the TSB.  The decision on whether CAFS is 
**  usable in a particular call is based on the type of query in terms of 
**  datatypes, comparisons, and conjunctions forming the compound condition. 
**  The decision also involves determining whether the container for the 
**  table (ie the physical file or files where a multi-location table is 
**  concerned) is actually on a CAFS unit.
**
**  In order to find out whether particular table's file(s) is/are 
**  located on a Smart Disc, a DI-like routine is provided so that this 
**  can be determined along with other table info, on a per file basis.  
**  In order to give the optimiser the info it needs to make the 
**  CAFS/no-CAFS decision, a CL routine for calling by the optimiser 
**  will return a structure containing, among other things, which INGRES 
**  datatypes are supported in elementary comparisons and what CAFS 
**  data-types they should be mapped onto, the maximum complexity that 
**  can be coped with, and other information pertaining to the structures 
**  to be passed to the SDcompile() CL routine (like maximum TSB area size).  
**  If the optimiser goes for CAFS then the second function in this section 
**  is invoked to compile its input to a CAFS Search Task Specification 
**  Block.
**  
**  The SD routines which do the actual input operations are much 
**  simplified by being cast as an extension to DI.  This means that SD 
**  does not handle file open/close type activities but runs on the back 
**  of normal IO.  One implication of this is that DIopen needs to always 
**  request CAFS capabilities on all connections. If such capability is 
**  refused this should be recorded in the DIio struct in order to 
**  implement SDinformation(). Other than that the open can proceed as 
**  normal, as long as all tables for which CAFS is available have it 
**  on their connections.  There needs to be a trace option on DIopen to 
**  log those occasions  when CAFS access was refused, for diagnostic 
**  purposes.
**
**  There are a number of ways in which 'SD' input operations differ 
**  from standard 'DI' input. First, notice it is input and not input/output, 
**  SD only handles input operations (searches).  The SD routines take over 
**  after the table has been opened via the normal DI route. Two levels of 
**  interface could be provided: 
**  1 A CL interface which returns a 'pseudo page' of tuples that satisfy 
**  the  condition.  
**  
**  2 A CL interface which returns a single tuple at each call.  
**  The 'pseudo page' solution works best for DMF. 
**
**  Using the Pseudo page interface, a page of tuples is retrieved using 
**  SDpageread(). SDpageread() will scan a number of INGRES pages/VME 
**  blocks and deliver a pseudo-page of 'hit' records, being rows which 
**  satisfy the programmed condition. The caller of SDpageread() limits 
**  the search to a start page/number of pages,  SDpageread() responds with: 
**  
**  1. The number of pages scanned, which could be less than the request 
**  if the pseudo page of 'hit' records is filled. In this case a further 
**  call of SDpageread() will be needed, specifying a new start page and 
**  number of pages to complete the scan, and so on.  
**  
**  2. The 'pseudo page' of rows. These rows are in CAFS format and, 
**  importantly, their TIDs are at the front of each row because they come 
**  from different pages. This return is only available if the status 
**  return is OK or DI_LASTPAGE.  
**  
**  3. A STATUS which can be set to one of: 
**      OK - Here is a full page and there may be more 
**      SD_LASTPAGE - Here is a partly filled page and all the requested 
**      pages have been scanned 
**      SD_NOHIT - No records were found in the requested scan that matched 
**      the condition.
**        + a number of error messages based on validation of inputs.
**
**  This means that in order to effect a scan of a table you call 
**  SDpageread(), process the page and recall SDpageread() with an updated 
**  start page/number of pages until the status returned tells you 
**  there are no more rows to find.
**
**  At any point a search can be abandoned simply by not calling any more 
**  routines, without incurring penalties. DIclose() will close the 
**  connection or a further call of SDpageread() for the same file with a 
**  different TSB will reset the condition for this connection and start 
**  a new scan.  It is a function of the CL to spot that a connection is 
**  being used to continue the same scan without an intervening IO and 
**  so optimise out CAFS initialisation each time.
**
**  The condition has already been checked as appropriate for CAFS and 
**  the data required by the CAFS unit, the Task Specification Block (TSB), 
**  has already been produced (compiled) and stored along with the Query 
**  Execution Plan (QEP) to be available on a per-thread basis. 
**
**  Note that it is a facility of the system to handle the switching of 
**  programs on CAFS to cope with multiple connections (to the same or 
**  multiple tables) but a function of these interfaces to cope with 
**  switching of condition for multiple threads using the same connection 
**  within a single multi-threaded server. 
**
**  History:
**      19-sep-89 (kwatts)
**          Created new for 6.2.
**	15-feb-91 (kwatts)
**	    Modified for VMS so that if xDEV_TEST is not set the SD
**	    procedures are declared as cpp macros.
**	22-nov-91 (kwatts)
**	    Removed define for E_SD_MASK (it goes in compat.h)
**	04_dec_92 (kwatts)
**	    Added SD_DATA_VALUE structure for new Smart Disk binding
**	    information
**          Also changes to SD_CAPABILITIES for binding info.
**	26-jan-93 (kwatts)
**	    Missed a change for new Smart Disk regarding decimal - the
**	    kcormask field in a GDD is now a precision field.
**	03-mar-96 (albany)
**	    Cross integrated Unix 423246:
**		06-feb-96 (johnst)
**		Bug 72205.
**		Adding true binary compression (TCB_C_HICOMPRESS) to ingres 
**		broke ICL SCAFS which only knew the previous TCB_C_STANDARD 
**		compression.  Changed SD_ATTR_INFO.compressed element from a 
**		bool to a char and defined SD_C_NONE, SD_C_STANDARD, 
**		SD_C_HICOMPRESS ingres storage compression types to pass 
**		no/low/hi compression info through this interface. The 
**		compression type values are copied from the TCB_C_* values 
**		defined in dmp.h.
**	01-dec-2000	(kinte01)
**	    Bug 103393 - removed nat, longnat, u_nat, & u_longnat
**	    from VMS CL as the use is no longer allowed

** Name: SD_DT_ID - Datatype id to match mainline's DB_DT_ID.
**
** Description:
**      All datatype ids to be used in INGRES must be declared as DB_DT_IDs.
**      Legal values for a DB_DT_ID are in the range 1-127, with certain numbers
**      excluded.  Furthermore, the negation of these IDs
**	are also legal, and represent the nullable versions of the corresponding
**	datatypes.  The limited range of 1-127 has to do with the method the
**      DBMS uses for determining which datatypes a given datatype can be
**      automatically converted (coerced) into.  That method uses a 128 bit long
**      bit-mask to represent some set of datatypes.
**
**	All DB_DATA_VALUEs and DB_EMBEDDED_DATAs will be "of" one of the
**	datatypes whose IDs are defined here.  Note that the semantics of the
**	data may differ depending on whether it is a DB_DATA_VALUE or a
**	DB_EMBEDDED_DATA.  For instance, take the datatype ID DB_CHR_TYPE:
**	When used as a DB_DATA_VALUE type, it limits the number of characters
**	to DB_CHAR_MAX, and limits the set of legal characters to the printable
**	ones.  However, when used as a DB_EMBEDDED_DATA type, these limitations
**	do not apply.
**
**      The SD version is created to conform to the architectural requirements
**      of INGRES. The SD CL will refer to the SD versions and mainline will
**      be responsible for the (null) mapping onto DB types. Note that not
**      all the DB_XXX_TYPE defines are declared as SD's, only those that
**      are of interest.

** Name: SD_GDD - Smart Disc attribute info structure
**
** Description: 
**  The description of the attributes in the Tuple is defined by a pointer 
**  to a row of General Data Descriptors (GDD). These describe the 
**  attributes in their physical order on disc. There is a GDD for each 
**  attribute in the fixed part of the tuple, with separate GDDs for 
**  any null indicator bytes, plus a single GDD for all self identifying 
**  field attributes in a compressed table.
**
**  SD_type is set to the value extracted from the SD_ATTR_INFO structure 
**  for the particular attribute, or 0 for a null indicator byte. The 
**  exception to this is where the INGRES data structure ends with some 
**  CAFS self-identifying format items, which is the case when the table 
**  is compressed. For this case, all self identifying items and their 
**  null indicators are subsumed into a single GDD, which will be the 
**  last GDD and have type set to 4.
**
**  flagsandqual is used to define which items we wish to actually retrieve.  
**  Since we are retrieving the whole tuple the value to set in this field 
**  is X30 in the general case and for null indicator bytes, X20 for a 
**  field which is followed by its null indicator, and X10 for the 
**  single GDD used for self identifying format items.
**
**  length defines the length, in bytes, of the attribute. Set to 1 for 
**  the self identifying format GDD. Length here must be exclusive of 
**  the null indicator byte, as it has its own GDD of length 1.
**
**  precision defines the precision for a decimal data-type, otherwise it
**  is set to zero.
**
**  The row of GDDs should include an entry for every attribute and every 
**  null indicator in the fixed part of the tuple, in the order that 
**  they appear on the disc (ie physical order). If there are any fillers 
**  to enforce alignment, these too must be represented by 
**  GDDs (of SD_type 0).
**
** History:
**     06-nov-89 (kwatts)
**          Created new for 6.2.
**     26-jan-93 (kwatts)
**	    kcormask has been changed to precision field.

** Name: SD_NODE - A single entry in the Smart Disc Condition structure 
**
** Description:
**
**  This structure is used to create a table of SD_NODEs to represent a
**  condition for the Smart Disc interface SDcompile(). The first entry 
**  in any condition table is of type HEAD, and then its parameters 
**  (op1/op2) point at other entries in the table, which can be and/or/not, 
**  a comp (comparison), or TRUE/FALSE. 
**
**  Each of these has a breakdown of parameters as shown in the 
**  structure. Note that:
**
**      cp	Is a condition pointer which is an index down a table of
**              SD_NODE entries.
**
**      fdp	Is a field pointer, which indexes a table of SD_GDD entries
**              describing the attributes of the tuple.
**
**      mcp	Is a mask/constant pointer. It is the index down a 
**              mask/constants string of a particular mask or constant. These
**              indices are returned from calls of the SDconvert procedure
**              in an SD_ATTR_INFO structure.
**
**      and the estimated hit rate is only advisory.
**
** History:
**     06-nov-89 (kwatts)
**          Created new for 6.2.

**          addition of inter-column compare and binding for 6.5
