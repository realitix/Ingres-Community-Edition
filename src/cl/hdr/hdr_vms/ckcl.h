/**CL_SPEC
** Name: CK.H - Definitions of CK routines.
**
** Description:
**      This file defines the structures and constants associated with
**	the CK routines.
**
** Specification:
**
**  Description:  
**	The CK module performs "back-ups" and "restore" of INGRES databases.  
**	INGRES databases consist of directories of DI files. The backup and
**	restore may be performed to either disk or tape devices.
**      
**  Intended Uses:
**	The CK routines are intended for the sole use of the 
**	checkpoint and rollforward routines in DMF.
**      
**  Assumptions:
**	The ingres programs which cause checkpoint saves or restores insure 
**	the required serialization through the use of INGRES locks.  
**	The implementation of CK must nost prevent concurrent access of the 
**	database (online backup is implemented by a combination of CK, LG
**	and JF).
**	
**      The physical disk location that the database was saved from can be 
**	different from the location it is restored to.
**	
**  Definitions:
**
**(	Save file	    -  The output of a CKsave call is conceptually a
**			       single file containing the contents of all 
**			       files in the DI directory that was saved.  
**			       Enough information, e.g. the filenames on the
**			       directory, to restore the database location
**			       must be contained in the save file. The format
**                             should be whatever works most efficiently for
**                             host operating system. A database backup will
**			       consist of a save file for each INGRES location
**			       the database resides on.
**)
**  Concepts:
**
**	The CK routines must "remember" the original name given to each file
**	written to a CK save file.  The file is recreated with the same
**	name by the CK restoration routine.
**
**	The data recorded in the CK file should be redundantly recorded
**	if possible.  The data that is saved in these files is most valuable.
**	Writing multiple copies of the same tape can suffice.

** History: 
**      01-nov-1986 (Derek)
**          Created.
**	26-apr-1993 (bryanp)
**	    Added prototypes for 6.5.
**	26-apr-1993 (bryanp)
**	    arg_list is a PTR, not a (PTR *).
**	7-jun-93 (ed)
**	    created glhdr version contain prototypes, renamed existing file
**	    to xxcl.h and removed any func_externs
**	31-mar-1999 (kinte01)
**	    cross integrate Unix change 439756 by mcgem01
**          CK_TEMPLATE_MISSING moved here from ck.h
**          Also added definition for CK_COMMAND_ERROR.
**	01-dec-2000	(kinte01)
**	    Bug 103393 - removed nat, longnat, u_nat, & u_longnat
**	    from VMS CL as the use is no longer allowed
**	13-mar-2001 (kinte01)
**	    Add CK_is_alive
**
