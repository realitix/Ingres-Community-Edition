/**
** Name:	mucl.h	- CL private interface for MU mutex functions.
**
** Description:
**	Defines the CL private interface to support the GL public
**	interface of the MU mutex module.  This interface permits
**	semaphore support in multi-threaded application environments.
**	Support for multi-threaded servers is provided through CS.
**
** History:
**	14-Nov-96 (gordy)
**	    Created.
**	12-dec-1996 (canor01)
**	    Make slightly more generic using existing CL macros for
**	    ease in porting.
**	20-dec-1996 (kch)
**	    Move include of cs.h from here to mucl.c. This prevents csnormal.h
**	    being included twice in those files that include cs.h and mu.h
**	    (eg. csinterface.c, moutil.c).
**	 7-jan-1997 (kch)
**	    Undo previous change - cs.h will now only be included once.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	18-aug-2009 (Bruce Lunsford)  Sir 122501
**	    On Windows, convert the underlying OS synchronization object from
**	    a mutex to a CriticalSection, which has less overhead.
