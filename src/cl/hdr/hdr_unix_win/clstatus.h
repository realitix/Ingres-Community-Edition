/**
** Name:	clstatus.h	- status codes returned by any CL routine
**				  that returns type STATUS
**
** Description:
**	Any CL routine that returns something of type STATUS needs to include
**	this file, as well as anyone who calls such a routine.  There is
**	a companion file, 'status.h', that is used by non-CL routines that
**	return type STATUS.
**
** History:
**	11-may-89 (daveb)
**		Remove RCS log and useless old history.
**  06-Jul-2005 (fanra01)
**      Bug 114804
**      Consolidate LO status codes into lo.h.
