** ME.h
**	defines global symbols needed by users of ME routines
**
**	History:
**	feb-83	-- (greg) written
**	17-Oct-1988 (daveb)
**		Take out sun special ifdef.   Should not be needed.
**	02-May-89 (GordonW)
**		added include <mecopy.h> for MECOPY macro calls
**	8-may-89 (daveb)
**		mecopy.h shouldn't exist.  define MECOPY macros
**		in line here.  Also remove redundant inclusion of
**		compat.h here.  It is an error for someone to include
**		me.h without having included compat.h first.
**
**		Note that NOT_ALIGNED macro is probably "illegal" in
**		INGRES Release 6, having not been speced or approved.
**	10-may-89 (daveb)
**		Two bugs in non-BYTE_ALIGN variants of the MECOPY macros.
**		VAR copied wrong bytes, CONST copied a few in the wrong
**		direction, trashing the source buffer.  oops.
**	10-may-89 (daveb)
**		Sometimes people don't hand MEcopy things that are really
**		char *'s.  This is officially illegal (You must correctly
**		cast args to a function), but sufficiently painful to
**		correct that the MECOPY macros need to coerce all args
**		to char * to be sure they will work correctly.  Bad things
**		happen when the macro does "s+4" when s _isn't_ a char *!
**
**		Also, don't use macros of the form _X, since that is 
**		perilously close to the symbols defined in the UNIX 
**		<ctype.h> and the INGRES <cm.h>:  rename _M to M1 and
**		_M8 to M8.
**
**	06-feb-89 (jeff/daveb)
**		Changed names of page protection flags to conform with 
**		coding standard (namespace conflict).
**      28-feb-1989 (rogerk)
**		Added ME_NOTPERM_MASK flag for shared memory allocations.
**      15-aug-1989 (fls-sequent)
**		Added ME_INGRES_SHMEM_ALLOC Meadvise flag for MCT.
**	16-feb-1990 (mikem)
**		Added ME_NOT_ALIGNED_MACRO() to be used to determine if a ptr
**	        is aligned to the worst case boundary for the machine.
**	23-may-90 (blaise)
**	    Integrated changes from 61 and ingresug:
**		Defined shortened versions of MECOPY_CONST_MACRO and
**		MECOPY_VAR_MACRO for sco_us5;
**		Comment out strings following #endif;
**		Change incorrect symbols ME_READ_PROT, ME_WRITE_PROT and
**		ME_EXECUTE_PROT to the correct names: ME_PROT_READ, etc;
**		Add perf macros for sun_u42.
**	4-june-90 (blaise)
**	    Integrated changes from termcl code line:
**		bug #9185 - added new cl internal error return for getting
**      	system specific error into the error log through the
**		CL_ERR_DESC. The new error added is
**		"E_CL1226_ME_SHARED_ALLOC_FAILURE".
**      21-aug-1990 (jkb)
**          Change ME_MAX_ALLOC from 1 <<12 to 1 << 15 to allow memory
**          allocation of up to 256mb rather than just 32mb
**      10-dec-1990 (mikem)
**          Change ME_MAX_ALLOC from 1 <<15 to 1 << 16 to allow memory
**          allocation of up to 512mb rather than just 256mb.  Some server
**	    class sun machines can handle more than 512mb of real memory now.
**	10-Jan-91 (anton)
**	    Renamed ME_INGRES_SHMEM_ALLOC to ME_INGRES_THREAD_ALLOC
**      25-sep-1991 (mikem) integrated following change: 12-aug-1991 (mikem)
**	    sir #39263
**          Change ME_MAX_ALLOC from 1 <<16 to 1 << 17 to allow memory
**          allocation of up to 1 gig rather than 512mb.  Some new machines
**	    now being delivered and to be delivered in 6.4's lifetime will be
**	    able to support 1 gigabyte of address space.
**	25-sep-1991 (mikem) integrated following change: 11-sept-91 (vijay)
**	    Performance changes. Using library routines for ME_fill
**	    etc. for hp8_us5, ris_us5 and ds3_ulx.
**	30-oct-1991 (bryanp)
**	    Added ME_SLAVEMAPPED_MASK so that DI can keep track of which
**	    segments have been mapped into the slaves.
**	14-apr-1992 (jnash) 
**	    Add new MEget_pages error messages: ME_NO_SHMEM_LOCK, ME_NO_MLOCK   
**	    ME_LOCK_FAIL and ME_LCKPAG_FAIL.  The first three are for unix, the
**	    last is vms.
**      28-nov-1992 (terjeb)
**	    Include <memory.h> for hp8_us5 to obtain prototype definitions for
**	    bcopy(), memset() and memcmp().
**	30-nov-92 (pearl)
**	    Add #ifdef for "CL_BUILD_WITH_PROTOS" and prototyped function
**	    declarations.
**	21-jan-93 (pearl)
**	    Add non-prototyped declarations for MEfree() and MEsize().
**	08-feb-93 (pearl)
**	    Add a few declarations that were missing.
**	24-mar-93 (smc)
**          Piggy backed hp8_us5 change for axp_osf to use library routines
**          for ME_fill etc.
**	7-jun-93 (ed)
**	    created glhdr version contain prototypes, renamed existing file
**	    to xxcl.h and removed any func_externs
**	21-jun-93 (mikem)
**	    Added su4_us5 change to use library routines instead of ME routines
**	    where appropriate (included "metune" output from tests run on a 
**	    sparc2000 machine).
**	6-Jul-1993 (daveb)
**	    Move hp8_us5 include inside the gate, and also include <strings.h>
**	    so bcopy() would get defined.  Also ifdef out bogus FUNC_EXTERNs
**	    for system routines at the end.  You should include the system
**	    header to get those defines, or at the least include them in 
**	9-aug-93 (robf)
**          Add su4_cmw
**	    very system-specific ifdefs if they aren't in a system header.
**	11-aug-93 (ed)
**	    removed MEreqmem extern since it is in me.h
**	23-aug-1993 (bryanp)
**	    Moved ME_ALIGN into this file from <meprivate.h>, in the process
**		fixing ME_ALIGN to have its own unique value, rather than
**		(accidentally) having the same value as ME_NOTPERM_MASK.
**      23-aug-1993 (mikem)
**	    Change ME_MAX_ALLOC from 1 <<17 to 1 << 18 to allow memory
**	    allocation of up to 2 gig rather than 1 gig.  Some new machines
**	    now being delivered and to be delivered in 6.5's lifetime will be
**	    able to support 2 gigabyte of address space.
**	  
**	    Also included <memory.h> on su4_us5 to pick up system prototypes
**	    for mem*() routines.
**	16-sep-93 (vijay)
**		Include string.h for AIX to get inline code for memcpy etc.
**		Use memcpye etc which are cheaper on AIX. Include systypes.h.
**      11-feb-94 (ajc)
**              Added hp8_bls specific entries based on hp8*
**      10-feb-95 (chech02)
**              Added rs4_us5 for AIX 4.1.
**	23-may-95 (fanra01)
**		Desktop porting changes.
**	11-aug-95 (rambe99)
**              Moved MEcmp, MEcopy and MEfill defines for sqs_ptx here to
**		conform to the same method used by other platforms.  
**	08-nov-95 (sweeney)
**		re-integrate morayf's change inadvertently backed
**		out by the previous (rambe99) sequent submission.
**      10-nov-1995 (murf)
**              Added sui_us5 to all areas specifically defined with su4_us5.
**              Reason, to port Solaris for Intel.
**      17-jul-95 (morayf)
**		Added sos_us5 where odt_us5 used.
**	17-oct-95 (emmag)
**		Added int_wnt and axp_wnt to save on a function call.
**	08-nov-1995 (canor01)
**		Added ME_FASTPATH_ALLOC for fastpath API.
**      12-Dec-95 (fanra01)
**          Added definitions for extracting data for DLLs on windows NT and
**          using data from a DLL in code built for static libraries.
**      16-Apr-96 (fanra01)
**          Changed definition of ME_MAX_ALLOC from 1 << 15 to 1 << 18.  The
**          definition of ME_MPAGESIZE remains at 4096.  This gives a possible
**          1Gbyte memory area.
**      30-May-96 (stial01)
**          Added ME_TUXEDO_ALLOC (B75073)
**	03-jun-1996 (canor01)
**	    Add definitions for thread-local storage functions.
**	22-nov-1996 (canor01)
**	    Move definitions of CL-specific thread-local storage functions
**	    to meprivate.h to avoid conflicts with similar functions in GL.
**	12-dec-1996 (donc)
**	    Cope with the VERY unfortunate choice of the INT and FLOAT names
**	    (they conflict mith Microsoft definitions) by ifeffing them out
**	    when OpenROAD is being compiled.
**      21-may-1997 (musro02)
**          Moved MEcmp, MEcopy and MEfill defines here for sqs_ptx to conform
**          to the same method used by other platforms.
**      01-Oct-97 (fanra01)
**          Add MEcopylng macro for NT.
**	02-dec-1997 (canor01)
**	    Update MEcopylng macros for Unix.

**	    Remove obsolete version string odt_us5.
**	07-Sep-1999 (allmi01/bonro01)
**	    Added dgi_us5 to list of platforms that use memcpy.
**	26-Jan-2000 (hanch04)
**	    Redefined CC to CCHAR
**	28-Jan-2000 (hweho01)
**	    Added support for AIX 64-bit platform (ris_u64). 
**      14-Jul-2000 (hanje04)
**          The shared library suffix for int_lnx is ".so.2.0".
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	19-jan-2001 (somsa01)
**	    Added ibm_lnx defines fro S/390 Linux.
**	24-May-2001 (musro02)
**	    Added nc4_us5 defines to platforms defining MEcopy, etc.
**      06-june-2001 (legru01)
**          Added sos_us5 to platforms defining MEcopy. 
**	5-Jun-2001 (bonro01)
**	    Added rmx_us5 to platforms that use system library
**	    calls for MEcopy, MEcopylng, MEfill, MEfilllng & MEcmp
**          This was prompted by a bug found during ICE testing
**	    where buffers greater than 32k were not transferred back
**	    to the browser correctly. 
**      24-May-2001 (linke01)
**          Added usl_us5 defines to platforms defining MECOPY_WRAPPED_MEMCPY
**          to fix the truncated HTML page problem in ICE demo, (this is part
**          of change#446906. 
**      26-Jun-2001 (linke01)
**          when submitted change to piccolo, it was propagated incorrectly, 
**          re-submit the change. (this is to modify change#451142).
**      29-Nov-1999 (hanch04)
**          First stage of updating ME calls to use OS memory management.
**          Make sure me.h is included.  Use SIZE_TYPE for lengths.
**	06-dec-1999 (somsa01)
**	    NT does not have strings.h .
**	16-dec-1999 (somsa01)
**	    Include systypes.h before stdlib.h to prevent compile problems
**	    on platforms such as HP.

**      24-feb-1999 (hanch04)
**          Added stdlib.h for memalign
**	08-feb-2001 (somsa01)
**	    Porting changes for i64_win.
**      23-Oct-2002 (hanch04)
**          Make pagesize variables of type long (L)
**	19-mar-2003 (somsa01)
**	    Removed osolete define ME_MAX_TLS_KEYS.
**	25-mar-2003 (somsa01)
**	    It turns out that ME_MAX_TLS_KEYS is still needed on Windows.
**	    Re-added the define.
**	31-Mar-2003 (bonro01)
**	    Change MEcopy() to use memmove() instead of memcpy() on i64_hpu
**	    The CL spec specifies that overlapping buffers are allowed if the
**	    destination address is lower than the source address, but memcpy()
**	    on i64_hpu causes memory overlays if the buffers overlap in any
**	    direction.
**	    This problem was discovered on i64_hpu because of code in gcarw.c
**	    that uses MEcopy() for overlapping buffers.
**      03-Apr-2003 (hweho01)
**          Defined MEcopy to OS memmove for rs4_us5 (AIX) platform,     
**          because memmove performs the copying nondestructively if the
**          areas of the Source and Target parameters overlap.
**	24-sep-2004 (somsa01)
**	    To avoid unaligned access messages on Linux Itanium, use
**	    memmove() instead of memcpy().
**	19-Jan-2005 (schka24)
**	    Comment updates re page based allocation.  Given the recent
**	    changes (on some platforms) to avoid manual page allocation
**	    via sbrk(), it is no longer true that we track pages
**	    independently.  Rather, free's must match get's, just like
**	    the usual situation with malloc and free (which is what is
**	    being used under the covers.)
**	16-Mar-2005 (bonro01)
**	    To avoid unaligned access messages on Solaris a64_sol, use
**	    memmove() instead of memcpy().
**	04-May-2005 (hanje04)
**	    Use sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE) to determine ME_MPAGESIZE on Mac
**	    OS X so we can use valloc() to request aligned memory.
**      09-mar-2006 (horda03)
**          Defining MEfilllng which is missing on windows.
**       5-Feb-2006 (hanal04) Bug 115468
**          Overlapping buffers should not be used on i64_hpu memcpy().
**          Use memmove() when defining MECOPY_VAR_MACRO and
**          MECOPY_CONST_MACRO.
**	04-Feb-2008 (hanje04)
**	    SIR S119978
**	    Replace mg5_osx with OSX and add support for Intel OSX.
**	22-Jun-2009 (kschendel) SIR 122138
**	    Use any_aix, sparc_sol, any_hpux symbols as needed.

** Name: ME_NOT_ALIGNED_MACRO - is a ptr aligned to worst cast boundary.

** Description:

**	a BYTE_ALIGN architecture.  On some non-BYTE_ALIGN machines 
**	ALIGN_RESTRICT has been defined to be long rather than char.  What

/**CL_SPEC
** Name: ME.H - Page based dynamic memory allocator
**
** Description:
**      This file contains define's and datatype definitions for a
**	page based memory allocator.
**
** Specification:
**
**  Description:
**
**	The ME module provides dynamic memory allocation and deallocation to
**	a client.  The allocation unit is a ME_MPAGESIZE page, and all
**	allocation and deallocation requests are in units of pages.  
**	Deallocation of pages must exactly match allocation of pages,
**	in the traditional manner of malloc() and free().  (Indeed, on
**	some platforms -- those which define xCL_SYS_PAGE_MAP -- the
**	underlying memory allocation mechanism is indeed malloc(), or
**	an equivalent, and free().)
**
**	Shared memory regions are also available via ME when using
**	MEadvise(ME_INGRES_ALLOC).  Current clients of shared memory
**	consist of the UNIX logging and locking systems, and the UNIX
**	DBMS server slave processes.  Anticipated clients of this shared
**	memory interface include the DBMS buffer pool.
**
**  Intended Uses:
**
**	The dynamic memory usage of the dbms server requires a "page" based
**	allocation and deallocation scheme.  This "page" based system is best
**	implemented below the CL, rather than above based on a byte abstraction.
**      
**    Assumptions:
**
**	The normal usage of the ME page requests will be relatively infrequent 
**	requests for large numbers of pages.  Memory in general will be 
**	available back to the system at session termination time, and in 
**	normal operation, memory usage will be LIFO in nature (this allows 
**	optimization on UNIX where only sbrk() can be used to free memory
**	back to the OS).  Client code must not be dependent on this operation
**	but an implementation may be optimized for it.
**
**	Clients of the shared memory subsystem should assume that the shared
**	memory resource is limited, and is not available at all on some systems.
**	Mainline designs based on the use of shared memory must include
**	alternate methods of performing the same task; possibly at some cost
**	in performance (ie. the	DBMS can not assume that there is only one
**	buffer manager per installation--though it can take advantage of
**	this optimization).  Also, designs which utilize shared memory are
**	expected to fully specify how the segments are installed and
**	deinstalled (this should include what happens should the installing
**	process call MEsmdestroy(), or abnormally terminate while associated
**	processes are attached.)  Such installation and cleanup procedures
**	are likely to be OS specific much like the overall install scripts.
**
**	The number of different shared memory segments that can be attached
**	per process is system dependent.  For this reason users of the shared
**	memory subsystem should assume a very limited number of shared memory
**	segments can be created, and should optimize use based on this.  Clients
**	should allocate a single shared memory segment, and then split the
**	segment into smaller pieces for their use.
**
**	Product designs which utilize shared memory are expected to fully
**	specify how the segments are installed and deinstalled (this should
**	include what happens should the installing process call MEsmdestroy(),
**	or abnormally terminate, while associated processes are attached.)
**	Installation and cleanup procedures are likely to be OS specific,
**	much like the overall install scripts.
**
**  Definitions/Concepts:
**
**	ME is providing a memory page management abstraction.  On some
**	systems this is not simple.  On systems such as UNIX this can
**      be accomplished by maintaining either a map of what memory is
**      allocated and what memory is meerly present or keeping a list of free
**      but present pages.  Allocation attempts would first search for
**      sufficient pages being present but not yet allocated and if that fails
**      then the system would be called to extend the memory region.  Requests
**      to free pages just mark the pages as not allocated and then check
**      if pages can be returned to the system.  On systems where we
**	manually allocate pages using sbrk(), a bit map of allocated pages
**	is kept to avoid page faults that could occur if we linked pages
**	in a list.  For reasonable page sizes and 32-bit address spaces,
**	the bit map is small:  1K per 64M of address space for 8K pages.
**
**	On some platforms, rather than maintaining a by-hand bitmap of
**	pages, we call the system provided malloc() (or equivalent) and
**	free().  This eliminates the ability to return memory to the OS
**	via sbrk(), unless free() does so;  but it turns out that
**	releasing address space can hardly ever happen anyway, so this
**	is no great loss.  Plus, sbrk() has been unreliable on some
**	platforms (e.g. some late RHEL 2.4 linux kernels), or suffers
**	from race conditions situations where other threads might be
**	operating via malloc/free.  (Even in the back-end, "OS" calls
**	can be C-library calls, which can use malloc and free.)
**      
**	Identification of shared memory segments however is abstracted to
**	files in a file system.  (This may be what the OS recommends--Mapped
**	files.)  If the OS doesn't prefer a file name to identify shared
**	memory, these ME routines can be written to use a file to store
**	whatever identification might be needed to get to the shared memory
**	segment.  The fact that the file contains a shared memory id is local
**	to ME as these files are not intended for use by any other code.  On
**	UNIX, mmap(2) provides the right abstraction, but System V shared
**	memory may have to be used.  System V provides a useful function
**	named ftok(3) which takes an existing file and computes a number
**	to identify a shared memory segment so the file name abstraction
**	is not too bad.  Because of these issues we have chosen to use
**	the LOCATION CL abstraction to identify shared memory.
**      
**      Another shared memory issue is whether portions of mapped shared
**      memory can be unmapped.  Many systems have an all-or-nothing attitude
**      about shared memory (the page map abstraction mentioned above
**	handles this.)
**
**      Other shared memory issues are not so easily abstracted; especially
**	when contemplates configuring shared memory segments into "unrelated"
**	user processes.  This functionality is not addressed by this proposal.
**
** History:
**	02-May-88 (anton)
**	    Clarifications.
**
**      23-Feb-88 (anton)
**          Initial definition.
**	30-oct-1991 (bryanp)
**	    Added ME_SLAVEMAPPED_MASK so that DI can keep track of which
**	    segments have been mapped into the slaves.
**	12-sep-2002 (devjo01)
**	    Add ME_LOCAL_RAD to advise page allocator to inform underlaying
**	    OS to allocate the request from memory physically on the
**	    home Resource Affinity Domain (RAD) of the calling process.
**	    This is only of concern for Non-Uniform Memory Architecture
**	    (NUMA) machines, and will be ignored on non-NUMA boxes.
**	19-Jan-2005 (schka24)
**	    Comment update.  As long as we base some platforms on malloc
**	    and free, free-page requests must mirror the corresponding
**	    get-page result.
**	08-May-2007 (wanfr01)
**	    SIR 118278 - add ME_VERBOSE_MASK to allow csinstall to
**	    display detailed error messages.

/**
** Generalized MEcopy macros to generate in-line copy code or
** a function call to MEcopy depending upon size of copy buffer.
**
** History:
**	05-Apr-89 (GordonW)
**		initial version
**	08-Apr-89 (GordonW)
**		modify for Xenix/Unix SYSv macro size limits
**	17-apr-89 (daveb)
**		Fix syntax errors in non-BYTE_ALIGN macros.  oops.
**	27-Apr-89 (GordonW)
**		moved from cl/clf/hdr to cl/hdr/hdr
**		added _MECOPY_INCLUDE test for re-enterancy
**	08-may-89 (daveb)
**		move directly into me.h now that it's approved.
**		Two bugs in non-BYTE_ALIGN variants of the MECOPY macros.
**		VAR copied wrong bytes, CONST copied a few in the wrong
**		direction, trashing the source buffer.  oops.
**	10-may-89 (daveb)
**		Sometimes people don't hand MEcopy things that are really
**		char *'s.  This is officially illegal (You must correctly
**		cast args to a function), but sufficiently painful to
**		correct that the MECOPY macros need to coerce all args
**		to char * to be sure they will work correctly.  Bad things
**		happen when the macro does "s+4" when s _isn't_ a char *!
**
**		Also, don't use macros of the form _X, since that is 
**		perilously close to the symbols defined in the UNIX 
**		<ctype.h> and the INGRES <cm.h>:  rename _M to M1 and
**		_M8 to M8.
**	23-Mar-1999 (kosma01)
**		Chose memcpy for sgi_us5
**	19-Nov-1999 (hanch04)
**		Wipe out all macros, use OS calls.
**      02-Feb-2001 (fanra01)
**              Bug 103864
**              Update MEcalloc macro to use MEreqmem.
**	02-Dec-2010 (miket) BUG 124798
**		Until overlapping dest/src MEcopy calls are found and
**		fixed, map MEcopy to memmove() rather than memcpy().
