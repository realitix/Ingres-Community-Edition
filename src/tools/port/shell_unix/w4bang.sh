#
# Build the w4gl libraries and executables.
#
#   History:
#	02-Oct-90 (andys)
#	    Created.
#	18-oct-90 (brett)
#	    Expanded the bang script to follow the build procedure
#	    and group headers, libraries and executables.  Added the
#	    -F and -n options to pass to ming.
#	24-oct-90 (jab)
#	    Changed the Bourne shell programming constructs to work.
#	    (For the record, 'for w in "$*"' executes at least once,
#	    even if there are no arguments; 'for w in $*' does not
#	    execute if there are no arguments.)
#	07-Nov-90 (andys)
#	    Add files_unix to list of directories containing 'special files'
#	    as it is no longer empty.
#	20-nov-90 (brett)
#	    Add front/utils/fmt to build new w4gl fmt library.
#	20-nov-90 (jab)
#	    Added cl/clf/nm on the list of libraries to build, which
#	    should've been included when the source to that directory
#	    was. (Oh, well.)
#	25-nov-90 (brett)
#	    Add front/embed/libqgca to the list of build directories.
#	15-dec-90 (brett)
#	    Add front!embed!hdr and clf/cl/gv directories.
#	15-dec-90 (brett)
#	    Add woof!hdr to the list of header directories.
#	16-dec-90 (brett)
#	    Update build directories, and procedures.
#	17-dec-90 (jab)
#	    Added cl/clf/ol to put in some 9000/300-specific code
#		without affecting the 6204p code line.
#	17-dec-90 (brett)
#	    Add directory checking code, if directory isn't there
#	    show a messge and continue, except for ercompile.
#	17-dec-90 (brett)
#	    Directory existence checks were wrong, fixed them.
#	20-dec-90 (brett)
#	    Add in code for special 3gl files.  Make the build process
#	    a little more resilient.  If there isn't a MING file then
#	    make one so things don't fail silently.
#	20-dec-90 (brett)
#	    Add the code to build the message files, under specials.
#	    Add a sanity check to make sure all the w4gl libraries
#	    are in place.
#	20-dec-90 (brett)
#	    Fix a couple bugs introduced in the last change.
#	21-dec-90 (brett)
#	    Fixed an echo statement for sph.msg.  Added echo hints to
#	    tell the user what the build script is doing.
#	09-jan-91 (brett)
#	    Add the motif libraries to the build list.
#	16-apr-91 (jab)
#	    Removed the motif libraries from the build list, and in fact,
#	    updated the build list to know about the W4GL04 list of things
#	    to make.
#	    Also, this now insists that you're running as ingres to make
#	    the "mkw4glcat" script work predictably.
#	17-apr-91 (jab)
#	    Corrected a few directory names in the script, namely, clf/gv
#	    should've been "cl/clf/gv" and so on.
#	17-apr-91 (jab)
#	    Checks to make sure that "mkw4gldir" was run before starting.
#	30-apr-91 (jab)
#	    Runs "mkdl3gl" and "w4glprerls" now.
#	3-may-91 (jab)
#	    Added "front/embed" to list of libs to make.
#	13-may-91 (jab)
#	    Added "cl/clf/dl" to list of libs to make.
#	16-may-91 (jab)
#	    Added cl/clf/specials to list of libs to make.
#	8-june-91 (jab)
#	    Added w4gl/specials to list of libs to make.
#	13-jun-91 (kimman)
#	    Moving where cl/clf/specials and w4gl/specials are made from the
#	    list of libs to list of executables, since they are MINGH and don't
#	    do anything under 'ming lib' but does do something under 'ming'.
#	17-jun-91 (jab)
#	    Pulled special processing of 3GL files from end of this script,
#	    because mk3glfiles should do it now.
#	22-jul-91 (jab)
#	    Added cl/clf/ol to CL sparse tree.
#	26-feb-92 (jab)
#	    Substantial changes for W4GLII builds.
#	12-mar-92 (jab)
#	    "mkw4vers" is now run automatically to recreate the version-string
#		file so that "all the right files" get recompiled by w4bang when
#		the version string changes.
#	12-mar-92 (jab)
#	    Just noticed that we weren't running "mk3glfiles" and should've.
#	20-aug-92 (jab)
#	    On the RS/6000, we actually need to create the 3GL support AFTER
#		everything else is done. Unfortunate, but true; on some other platforms,
#		it must be before making "sphmerge".
#	11-jan-1993 (lauraw)
#		Modified for new VERS/CONFIG scheme:
#		This file used to cat tools/port/conf/VERS to set 
#		a variable called $vers which is not used anywhere here,
#		so I removed the outdated reference to the VERS file. 
#	03-aug-1993 (dwilson)
#		Moved to the ingres library, and converted to the w4gl 3.0
#		directory structures...
#	08-sep-1993 (jab)
#		Modified to run "mkw4apped" if asked.
#	10-sep-1993 (jab)
#		Deleted an erroneous debugging statement. (Oops.)
#	08-sep-1993 (www)
#		Modified to use the 6.5 source tree for cl, common,and front.
#	14-sep-1993 (gillnh2o)
#		Added 'mkfecat'.
#	21-sep-1993 (dwilson)
#		Moved some activities around, to better conform to the W4GL 3.0 
#		build checklist.  In addition, commented out the build of 
#		w4gl/woof/proto, as it doesn't work.
#	24-sep-1993 (gillnh2o)
#		Due to the process of submission and integrations
#		I am trying to accomplish getting the same file in
#		main that is in the w4gl30 branch. I also have 
#		re-ordered the comments.
#	28-sep-1993 (jab)
#		Changed the behavior of '-n' so that no header files are
#		created if you ran "w4bang -n". Not w4glvers.h, gv.h, nothing.
#	28-sep-1993 (zaki)
#		Changed the behavior of '-F' so that all the libraries on 
#		which sphmerge depends on are deleted to ensure no old
#		symbols  are used in  building  sphmerge.   Added script
#		w4dellibs.sh to delete libraries.
#       05-jan-1995 (chech02)
#               Added rs4_us5 for AIX 4.1
#       02-Aug-1999 (hweho01)
#               Added ris_u64 for AIX 64-bit platform.
##      01-Aug-2004 (hanch04)
##          First line of a shell script needs to be a ":" and
##          then the copyright should be next.
##	4-Oct-2004 (drivi01)
##		Due to merge of jam build with windows, some directories
##		needed to be updated to reflect most recent map.
