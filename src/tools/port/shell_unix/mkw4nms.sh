# Make a set of files in /tmp (or $TMPDIR) that contains the
# nm(1) output of all the libraries in $ING_BUILD/lib. This is
# handy for quick troubleshooting of "what routine is in what library?"
# sorts of questions.

# (Why put this in a shell script? Well, it's used a lot in ports, and
# if you screw up the commands you can bash your $ING_BUILD/lib!)

##          First line of a shell script needs to be a ":" and
##          then the copyright should be next.
