# mksphcat - Create the file sph.msg.
#
# This file is the concatonation of all the *.msg files from the
# "w4gl" code tree.
#
# History:
#	03-jul-90 (brett)
#	    Created from mkfecat.sh.
#	23-jul-90 (brett)
#	    Renamed the msg file, name was too long for the old copy.
#	17-aug-90 (brett)
#	    Renamed sapphire to w4gl, leave files with sph in the name alone.
#	08-oct-90 (brett)
#	    General clean up and check of functionality.
#	14-jan-91 (brett)
#	    Add chmod to set the correct modes on the message files.
#	18-mar-91 (jab)
#	    Copied from w4gl03 library, changed the "sed" to "awk"
#           invocations, and changed it so that it would run all of the
#           *.msg files at once. This saves us from having to concatenate
#           it into one giant ".msg" file, which doesn't work if only a
#           handful use "GENERIC_ERROR_MAPPING".
#	16-apr-91 (jab)
#	    It now copies all the ".msg" files to a directory in /tmp,
#	    and just runs "ercomp *.msg". There's a problem in that
#	    ercompile insists on "generr.h" to be in the local directory
#	    (long story, not worth the wait), and so we just copy it in
#	    from $ING_SRC/common/hdr/hdr.
#	08-may-91 (kimman)
#	    Changing ${TMPDIR:-"/tmp"} to be more portable ${TMPDIR-"/tmp"}
#	30-oct-91 (jab)
#	    Put in support for the 6.4 error file names.
#	26-feb-92 (jab)
#	    Moved to support W4GLII mechanisms. Really doesn't change a
#		lot, but there are no more sparse trees. At all.
#	11-jan-93 (lauraw)
#		Modified for new VERS/CONFIG scheme:
#		Release id comes from genrelid now.
#	14-sep-93 (dwilson)
#		Added a line copying $ING_SRC/common/hdr/hdr/sqlstate.h,
#		for same reason we copied generr.h to the temporary
#		directory (see above)
#	15-sep-93 (dwilson)
#		Needed to change fastname and slowname from *w4gv3.mnx
#		to *w4gv4.mnx for W4GL 3.0
