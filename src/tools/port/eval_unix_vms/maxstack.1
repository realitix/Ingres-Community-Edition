.SH NAME
maxstack \- Find stack size limitations
.SH ORIGIN
Relational Technology, Inc.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B maxstack
[ -v ][ -x ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Maxstack
finds out how large the stack may become.  It tries to grow a 100kB
stack, 1k at a time, and then prints the largest stack it could create. 
If a SIGBUS, SIGILL, SIGSEGV, or SIGSTACK signal is received, the
program stops at that point.  Some systems, like the Gould/SEL, have a
fixed size stack determined at load time.
.PP
.B -v
``verbose'' mode prints the program's name and indents output by one tab
stop.
.PP
.B -x
``extra\-verbose'' mode prints the stack's size at every iteration. 
This is voluminous, but of use if the system is killing the program
before the summary can be written.  
.SH BUGS
.I Maxstack
does not take into account the size of the call frame in determining
stack size, therefore the size reported is approximate.  If the system
decides to kill \fImaxstack\fP outright for rampant memory consumption
the maximum size will not be printed unless the -x switch was thrown.
