.SH NAME
sysint \- Verify interruptability of system calls
.SH ORIGIN
Relational Technology, Inc.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sysint
[ -v ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Sysint
makes sure a SIGALRM signal will abort a sleeping system call.  It opens
a pipe, sets a timeout with \fIalarm(2)\fP and then hangs doing a
\fIread(2)\fP on the empty pipe.  The program prints ``OK'' when the
timout occurs.
.PP
.B -v
``verbose'' mode prints the program's name and some progress messages,
indented one tab stop.
.PP
BSD variants do not automatically abort a system call when a signal is
processed.  It is believed that you must \fIlongjmp()\fP out of the
handler to exit the kernal.  This is rumoured to be one of the ways that
BSD ``broke'' signaling compared to V7 and System V.  This affects the
ability to timeout lock waits in the lock driver for INGRES 3.0.
.SH BUGS
It is unclear whether this test proves anything at all.  If it doesn't
work, the process will probably hang.
