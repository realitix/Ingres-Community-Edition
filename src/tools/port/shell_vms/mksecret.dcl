$! This script builds UNIX versions of `clsecret.h,' a file containing
$! all configuration dependent definitions that are visible only to
$! the CL.  It extracts information that used to be kept in the
$! globally visible bzarch.h.  The earlier bzarch.h was written by mkhdr.
$! The new one is written by mkbzarch.
$!
$! The "clsecret.h" file written here is included by "cl/cl/hdr/clconfig.h",
$! which contains documentation about what each of the defines here means.
$!
$! Definitions like "BSD" or "WECOV" or "SYSV" or "SYS5" are NOT ALLOWED.
$! You must define a specific capability and create a test for it.
$!
$! BE SURE TO UPDATE CLCONFIG.H IF ANYTHING IS ADDED TO THIS PROGRAM.

$!! History:
$!!	28-jan-2005 (abbjo03)
$!!	    Created from mksecret.sh
$!!	26-nov-2008 (joea)
$!!	    Define xCL_USE_ETIMEDOUT and xCL_014_FD_SET_TYPE_EXISTS.
$!!	05-dec-2008 (joea)
$!!	    Add xCL_094_TLS_EXISTS.
$!!     05-aug-2010 (joea)
$!!         Add TYPESIG, xCL_068_USE_SIGACTION, and invocation of mathsigs.
$!!         Add comments from Unix mksecret.sh.

$! By default, use sigaction only if sigvec is not available
$! These defines are mutually exclusive
$! NOTE from HP VMS documentation:
$!     The sigvec and signal functions are provided for compatibility to old
$!     UNIX systems; their function is a subset of that available with the
$!     sigaction  function.

$! storage (TLS).  For System V threads, these are the thr_getspecific(),
$! etc. functions.  For POSIX threads, they are pthread_getspecific(),
$! etc.  If a server cannot be built using the system TLS functions
$! (usually because they depend on the system malloc()), replacement
$! functions from the CL will be used unless xCL_094_TLS_EXISTS is defined.
