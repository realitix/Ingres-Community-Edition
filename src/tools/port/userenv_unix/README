This directory contains prototype files used to set up the environment
for building INGRES on UNIX.


1. Copy the appropriate setup.* file(s) to your home directory:

	csh:		cp setup.csh ~/.setup
	ksh or sh:	cp setup.ksh $HOME/.setup

    If you have more than one INGRES build environment (for example,
    a csh and a ksh environment, or a 6.5/01 build and a 6.5/02 build)
    you will need a .setup file for each environment. You can name your
    .setup files anything you want, but this document and all other INGRES
    build documentation will refer to those files as ".setup".


2. Edit your .setup file and customize environment variables as necessary.
   The .setup file sets paths and variables that depend on local file systems
   and whether the environment is BSD or System V.


3. Invoke the .setup file:

	csh:		source ~/.setup
	ksh or sh:	. $HOME/.setup


4. Modify your session startup script (.cshrc, .kshrc, etc.)

   Since you must always invoke .setup before working on your INGRES
   build, you should modify your session startup script to invoke .setup
   each time you log in. If you have more than one build environment
   you should set up shell aliases or functions so you can switch back
   and forth between environments by invoking the various .setup files.

History: 
	24-nov-1992 (lauraw)
		Renamed 65* files to setup.*, so we don't have to update
		this and other documentation each time we put together a
		new release.
		Elided previous history, since most of it applied to files
		that no longer exist. The setup.* files will now contain 
		their own history.
		Removed cshrc*, kshrc*, profile*, and login* files, since
		apparently nobody uses them.
		Removed note about umask, because ming handles built file
		permissions, and test environment setup scripts should handle
		test environment umask.
		Removed note about supp60, since you are not likely to be
		looking in this file when you set up the supp60 account.
	02-dec-1992 (lauraw)
		Combined setup.c42 and setup.c5 into setup.csh.
		Combined setup.k42 and setup.k5 into setup.ksh.
