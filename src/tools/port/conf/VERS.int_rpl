# int_rpl is a pure 32-bit int_lnx with special packaging options.

# We'll fudge it up in the platform Jamdefs to not be a hybrid capable build.
# (not that it really matters all that much.)
# Note, probably could be re-done as int-lnx with a param RELID, a new
# set-option, and arch set to 32 bits.  Might be an interesting exercise
# in using the "new" build controls...
