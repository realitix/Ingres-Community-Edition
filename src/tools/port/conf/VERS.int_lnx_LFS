# Some goofy variant of 32 bit intel linux...

# Edit History:
#	20-Jun-2009 SIR 122138
#	    Implement new Datallegro-style VERS file format which can
#	    control jam variables as well as shell/compile options.
#       21-May-2010 (bonro01)
#           Remove ICE from standard builds
#	31-Aug-2010 (thich01)
#	    Add WITH_GEO for platforms where spatial is not supported.
#        7-Feb-2011 (hanal04) Bug 124731
#           Comment out WITH_GEO in default build parameters. We can

#           date.
