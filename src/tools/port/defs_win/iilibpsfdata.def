; History:
;	25-Aug-2004 (drivi01)
;	     Created.  Contains data symbols for psf.
;	11-Jan-2005 (drivi01)
;	     psf data shared library hasn't been created in jam build
;	     up to this point, due to recent opf changes, Psf_srvblk
;	     and Psf_init GLOBALDEFS must be exported in psf data library
;	     to avoid opf inconsistency errors.
;	01-Jul-2011 (kiria01) b125504
;		Removed real data as no longer needed. This whole library
;		is now redundant
