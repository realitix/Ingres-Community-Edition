# add this to help in multi-STAR configurations -
# the START table is destroyed by the setup
# sql, then re-created by the coordinator.
# It is possible for the slaves to run, and
# exhaust their sleep time before the coordinator
# can read all the slaves are up and create the table
# again.  This lets the coordinator get a head start
# on the slaves.
