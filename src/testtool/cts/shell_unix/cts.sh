## History:
##	15-mar-1991	New cts.sh created for SEPized CTS (lauraw)
##	24-nov-1995	(wadag01)
##			The output files $coordfile and $slavefile are now
##			defined in terms of $TST_OUTPUT (was $ING_TST)
##			which is set in $TST_SHELL/runcts.sh.
##      01-Aug-2004 (hanch04)
##          First line of a shell script needs to be a ":" and
##          then the copyright should be next.
#
# This is the "cts" command issued by the CTS SEP tests.
# It starts up the CTS coordinator and slaves and waits till they're done.
#
# $1 is database name
# $2 is test number (from test_num table)
# $3 is number of slaves
# $4 is the SEP test id (passed by SEP but not used in Unix)

# the trace flag should always be 0 for this "cts" command.
#
trace_flag=0

# All result files are suffixed ".res".
# Old .res files are removed before the CTS programs start.
# The .res files produced by this test are left so SEP can diff them.

# The Coordinator outputs a file called ctscoord.res. 
#
coordfile=$TST_OUTPUT/output/$4_c

# The Slave executable outputs files called ctsslv1.res, ctsslv2.res, and
# so forth. 
#
slavefile=$TST_OUTPUT/output/$4_
