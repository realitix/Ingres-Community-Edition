/*
** Name: mmmicro.c - allocator alloc/free/rm for the micro allocator
**
** Description:
**
** 	Implements MM_MICRO_STRATEGY:
**
**	MM_mcr_alloc maintains a stream of memory, comprised of 
**	blocks chained onto alloc_list and free_list, and returns
**	the requested amount of memory from the last block on the
**	alloc_list.  If alloc_list is empty or the block there is
**	too small, a block is moved from the free_list to the
**	alloc_list.  If that block is too small, a new block is
**	instead allocated from the parent pool.
**
**	MM_mcr_free frees the requested object and everything after by
**	scanning the alloc_list for the block containing the object,
**	noting the new end of the block, and moving all blocks after 
**	that one onto the free_list.
**
**	MM_mcr_rm free all blocks on free_list and alloc_list.
**
** History:
**	20-Jul-2004 (lakvi01)
**		SIR #112703, cleaned-up warnings.
**      26-Jul-2004 (lakvi01)
**          Backed-out the above change to keep the open-source stable.
**          Will be revisited and submitted at a later date.
