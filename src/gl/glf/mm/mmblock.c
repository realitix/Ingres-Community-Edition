/*
** Name: mmstblk.c - allocator alloc/free/rm for the block allocator
**
** Description:
**
** 	Implements MM_BLOCK_STRATEGY:
**
**	MM_blk_alloc quickly dequeues the first block on the pool's
**	free_list and returns it, because it can assume all requests
**	are of the same size.  If the free_list is empty MM_blk_alloc
**	allocates a big block from its parent, chains that big block 
**	onto the pool's alloc_list, breaks it up into blocks of the 
**	requested size, and puts them on the free_list.
**
**	MM_blk_free frees an individual block by putting it on the
**	pool's free_list.
**
**	MM_blk_rm removes the whole pool by freeing everything on the
**	alloc_list.
