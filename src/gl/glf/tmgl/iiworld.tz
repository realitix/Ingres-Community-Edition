# 		Updated timezone rules for Australia/New Zealand, courtesy of

# 		The file used to generate 1.0 timezone rules was mostly 
#		correct only to 1986/1987 for Australia, the same state 
#		that the sunos 4.1.3 files were in.
#
# 		Updated rules includes:  
#   		1) shift by Victoria and NSW to ending Summer Time earlier in
#      		   90/91.  Corrects start to lastSun for many states.
#   		2) WA and Queensland's short dallies into summer time.
#   		3) SA extension of summer time for the Adelaide Festival in 
#      		   even number years.
#   	 	4) The town of Yancowinna (in NSW but uses CST .. mostly),
#      		   and Lord Howe Island.

#           end at 0:00 on the 3rd Sunday in February UNLESS the 3rd Sunday in
#           February is the Sunday before Ash Wednesday; inthis case the end of DST
#           is the 4th Sunday in February. As Ash Wednesday is based on Easter, which
#           isn't a fixed date, I have entered rules to take into account the special

# From Guy Harris:
# People's Republic of China.  Yes, they really have only one time zone.
# From Bob Devine (January 28, 1988):
# No they don't.  See TIME mag, February 17, 1986 p.52.  Even though
# China is across 4 physical time zones, before Feb 1, 1986 only the
# Peking (Bejing) time zone was recognized.  Since that date, China
# has two of 'em -- Peking's and Urumqi (named after the capital of
# the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region).  I don't know about DST for it.

# . . .I just deleted the DST table and this editor makes it too

# Bill Allan 20-April-1996
#
# Updated timezone rules for Australia/New Zealand,
# based on modifications made by Kathy Brown in 1994 based on rules
# from George Sheppard of Sun MicroSystems.
#
# The file appended has been checked against information supplied by
# appropriate government departments and is correct for 1996.
# Future DST changes are based on legislation current in 1996 and may
# change in future.
#
#
# NOTE:
#	Brokem Hill and district (in western NSW) observe the same
#                   times as South Australia, including South Australian
#		    Daylight Savings times. 
#
#	Lord Howe Island is 30 minutes ahead NSW during normal times
#		    but during DST it advances only 30 minutes and so
#		    the time is the same as NSW during DST.
#
# Bill Allan - 05 Oct 1999
#        DST is to start on 27-Aug-2000 so that the Olympic Games being
#        held in Sydney (15-Sept-2000 to 01-Oct-2000) will be in DST.
#        DST start times for 2001 will revert to the normally start

#        The states involved are New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and

#        South Australia won't be changing.
#        The other states don't have DST so they won't be changing.

# on February 8, 1987, by Dave Sherman of the Law Society of Upper Canada,
# "...Canada (well, Ontario and at least some of the other provinces) are
# adopting the new daylight savings time rules...".  We assume all of
# Canada is doing so.
# From Bob Devine (January 28, 1988):
# All of Canada did have DST from your first rule except Saskatchewan.
# Which parts did not observe DST is hard to pinpoint but most of the

# NOTE: those that didn't have DST for that rule, also
# probably did not have it for several years previous.

# From Guy Harris:
# Rules are from the Official Airline Guide, Worldwide Edition, for 1987.
# Rules prior to 1987 are unknown.
# The comments in the OAG say "Only Ensenada, Mexicale, San Felipe and Tijuana
# observe DST."  This is presumably Baja California Norte, above 28th parallel,
# as listed there; Mexico/BajaSur is for "Baja California Sur and N. Pacific
# Coast (States of Sinaloa and Sonora)."
# From Bob Devine (January 28, 1988):
# The Federal District (where Mexico City is) has observed [DST] several
# times but not recently.
# I don't where to drawn the line in the North Baja area.  28th latitude
# sounds good -- but it may be higher (how far [d]o radio stations from
# San Diego affect culture?).
# The dates of DST probably go back to 1981.  The rules are the same as
# US's.  This is going to be a headache for US presidential electi[o]n years!
# From Arthur David Olson (February 13, 1988)
# Since the 1981 starting date is only "probable," we'll keep the 1987
# starting date below.
# From U. S. Naval Observatory (January 19, 1989):

# From Arthur David Olson (January 21, 1989):
# April 3 fell on a Sunday in 1988; October 29 fell on a Sunday in 1989.  Ahem.
# USNO claims there should be four Mexican zones rather than three:
# a zone that's GMT-8 with DST; a zone that's always GMT-7;
# a zone that's GMT-6 with DST; and a zone that's always GMT-6.
# Wait for more authoritative information before changing.

# From my Collins Diary for 1989 - 
# 
# "At the time of going to press the Home Office was unable to confirm
# the 1989 starting and finishing dates for BST*, but expressed the 
# view that 26 March and 29 October were the likeliest dates to be
# adopted"
# 
# *British Summer Time.
# From an Anonymous U. K. Donor (January 5, 1989):
#
# . . .our government is seriously considering applying Double Summer Time -
# putting the clocks forwards and back TWO hours for daylight saving time.
# This is advocated to standardise time in the EEC - we're all supposed to
# keep the same time and to change the clocks on the same dates in the future.
#
# Charles Kitson 22-Sep-1999.
# Bug 98866. I tracked down the following reference on BST dates after 1972.
# Between 1968 and 1971 Britain kept British Standard Time, GMT+1, all year round.
#
# The Summer Time Act 1972 defined the period of British Summer Time to start at 
# 2 am (GMT) on the morning of the day after the third Saturday in March or, if 
# that was Easter Day, the day after the second Saturday. It was to end at 2 am (GMT)
# on the day after the fourth Saturday in October.
# The duration of British Summer Time (BST) can be varied by Order of Council and
# in recent years has been changed so as to bring the date of the start of Summer Time
# into line with that used in Europe.
# The rule for 1981-1994 defined the start of Summer Time as the last Sunday in March
# and the end as the day following the fourth Saturday in October. The time of change
# was altered to 1 am (GMT).
# There is no rule for the dates of Summer Time (BST) for the years 1995, 1996 and 1997.
# The agreed dates are:
# For 1995 BST started on March 26 and ended on October 22
# For 1996 BST started on March 31 and ended on October 27
# For 1997 BST started on March 30 and ended on October 26
# In 1996 all clocks in Europe were changed the same date for the first time.
# From 1998 BST will be kept from the last Sunday in March until the last Sunday in 
# October. This has been adopted as a directive from the European Parliament and will 
# be effective from 1998-2001 inclusive.
# 1999: March 28 - October 31
# 2000: March 26 - October 29
# 2001: March 25 - October 28
# All changes to be at 1 am GMT. 
#
# To allow dates to be entered beyond 2001, I am making the assumption that the current
# rule will still apply.
