**
**  History:
**	27-Jan-92 (daveb)
**		Formatted to INGRES standard.
**	15-jul-93 (ed)
**	    adding <gl.h> after <compat.h>
**	21-jan-1999 (canor01)
**	    Clean up compiler warnings.
**	10-mar-1999 (walro03)
**	    Undefine abs for Sequent (sqs_ptx).
**	12-mar-1999 (somsa01)
**	    The previous change caused "Duplicate type specifier ..." errors
**	    from sys/types.h on HP-UX 10.20 . Thus, included systypes.h
**	    as well.
**	15-mar-1999 (popri01)
**	    stdlib causes compile errors for Unixware, so omit it.
**      18-May-1999 (linke01)
**          undefined abf for sgi_us5 to avoid confliction with 
**          /usr/include/stdlib.h 
**	31-mar-1999 (kinte01)
**	    put the include for systypes.h inside an ifndef VMS as this
**	    header doesn't exist on VMS
**      21-May-1999 (hweho01)
**          stdlib causes compile errors for ris_u64, so omit it.

/*{
** Name:  "SPsplay \- reorganize tree around node"
**
**	The tree is reorganized so that n is the root of the splay
**	tree t; results are unpredictable if n is not in t to start
**	with; t is split from n up to the old root, with all nodes to
**	the left of n ending up in the left subtree, and all nodes to
**	the right of n ending up in the right subtree; the left branch
**	of the right subtree and the right branch of the left subtree
**	are shortened in the process
**
**	Assumes that n is not NULL and is in t.
**
** Inputs:
**	n	the node to be made the root.
**	t	the tree containing n.
**
** Outputs:
**	none
**
** Returns:
**	none
