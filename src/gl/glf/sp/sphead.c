/*{
** Name:  "SPhead - find head"
**
**	Returns the head node in the tree t; t->root ends up pointing
**	to the head node, and the old left branch of t is shortened,
**	as if t had been splayed about the head element; this is done
**	by dequeueing the head and then making the resulting queue the
**	right son of the head returned by SPdet;
**
**	SPfhead is immediately faster, but doesn't help the amortized
**	performance.
**
** Inputs:
**	t	tree in question
**
** Outputs:
**	none
**
** Returns:
**	head	the first node in the tree, or NULL if the tree is empty.

 * SPhead() --	return the "lowest" element in the tree.
 *
 *	returns a reference to the head event in the event-set q,
 *	represented as a splay tree; t->root ends up pointing to the head
 *	event, and the old left branch of t is shortened, as if q had
 *	been splayed about the head element; this is done by dequeueing
 *	the head and then making the resulting queue the right son of
 *	the head returned by SPdet; an alternative is provided which
 *	avoids splaying but just searches for and returns a pointer to
 *	the bottom of the left branch
