/*{
**  Name:	MOstrset - standard set string buffer method
**
**  Description:
**
**	Copy a caller's string to the buffer for the instance.
**
**	The object plus the offset is treated as a pointer to a
**	character buffer having objsize bytes.  The input luserbuf is
**	ignored.  The string in userbuf is copied up to objsize; if it
**	wouldn't fit, returns MO_VALUE_TRUNCATED, otherwise OK.
**
**  Inputs:
**	 offset
**		value from the class definition, taken as byte offset to the
**		object pointer where the data is located.
**	 luserbuf
**		the length of the user buffer, ignored.
**	 userbuf
**		the user string to convert.
**	 objsize
**		the size of the output buffer.
**	 object
**		interpreted as a character buffer.
**  Outputs:
**	 object
**		gets a copy of the input string.
**  Returns:
**	 OK
**		if the operation succeseded
**	 MO_VALUE_TRUNCATED
**		if the output buffer wasn't big enough.
