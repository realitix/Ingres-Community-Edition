/*{
**  Name:	MOstrpget - standard get string pointer method
**
**  Description:
**
**
**	Copy the string pointed to by instance object to the output
**	userbuf , to a maximum length of luserbuf .  If the output is
**	bigger than the buffer, chop it off and return
**	MO_VALUE_TRUNCATED.
**
**	The offset and objsize from the class definition are ignored.
**	The object is considered a pointer to a string pointer, and will
**	be dereferenced to find the source string.
**  Inputs:
**	 offset
**		value from the class definition, taken as byte offset to the
**		object pointer where the data is located.
**	 objsize
**		the size of the object from the class definition, ignored.
**	 object
**		treated as a pointer to a string pointer.
**	 luserbuf
**		the length of the user buffer.
**	 userbuf
**		the output buffer.
**  Outputs:
**	 userbuf
**		contains the string of the value of the instance.
**  Returns:
**	 OK
**		if the operation succeseded
**	 MO_VALUE_TRUNCATED
**		if the output buffer was too small, and the value was chopped
**		off to fit.
**	 other
**		method-specific failure status as appropriate.
