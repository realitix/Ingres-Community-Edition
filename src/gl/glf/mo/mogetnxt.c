/**
**  Name: mogetnxt.c -- getnext operation for MO.
**
**  Description:
**
**	This module provides a symbol table that can be used by CL and
**	mainline clients to register objects of varying types as management
**	objects.  These objects can be get/set by classid, and may be
**	scanned.
**
**  Intended uses:
**
**	This is intended to be used by all server code that wishes to
**	export management/monitoring objects.
**
**  Interface:
**
**    The file defines the following visible functions.
**
**	MOgetnext		get data from the object.
**	MO_getnext		get data from the object, MO mutex held
**
**  History:
**	26-oct-91 (daveb)
**		created from old mi.c
**	15-jan-92 (daveb)
**		updated to mo 0.9.
**	22-jan-92 (daveb)
**		updated to mo.10
**	29-jan-92 (daveb)
**		broke out of mogetset.c
**	31-Jan-92 (daveb)
**		methodize heavily.
**	24-sep-92 (daveb)
**	    documented
**	30-Nov-1992 (daveb)
**	    Fix incorrect error code- return MO_NO_CLASSID, not
**	    MO_NO_INSTANCE.
**	5-May-1993 (daveb)
**	    Rename file mogetnxt.c instead of mogetnext.c, to meet
**	    msdos/coding standard conventions.
**	15-jul-93 (ed)
**	    adding <gl.h> after <compat.h>*
**      21-jan-1999 (canor01)
**          Remove erglf.h.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	07-aug-2001 (somsa01)
**	   Cleaned up compiler warnings.
**	 6-Apr-04 (gordy)
**	    Permit access if MO_ANY_READ attribute is set.

/*
** Name:  MOgetnext - get next object in class, instance order.
**
**	This public interface grabs the MO mutex before doing anything.
**
**	Given an object, attempts to return the next one.  Ordering is
**	as by STcompare of { classid, instance } of objects including
**	the input valid_perms bits.
**
**	As a special case, if the classid and instance are both a 0
**	length strings, then return the first of any instances in the
**	class space that match its valid_perms.
**
**	If the input instance does not exist or doesn't include
**	valid_perms, returns MO_NO_INSTANCE, and the output class is
**	unknown.
**
** Inputs:
**	valid_perms
**	the roles currently in effect, to be and-ed with object permissions to
**	determine access rights.
**
**	lclassid	length of the buffer for the classid.
**
**	classid		the classid in question.
**
**	linstance	length of the buffer for the instance.
**
**	instance	the instance in question.
**
**	lsbufp		pointer to the length of the output string buffer.
**
** Outputs:

**	classid		filled in with the new classid.
**
**	instance	filled in with the new instance.
**
**	lsbufp		if *sval is NULL, contains the actual length

/*{
**  Name:	MO_getnext - get next object in class, instance order.
**
**  Description:
**
**	This private interface assumes the MO mutex is held.
**
**	Given an object, attempts to return the next one that is
**	readable.  Ordering is as by STcompare of { classid, instance }
**	of objects including the input valid_perms bits.
**
**	As a special case, if the classid and instance are both a 0
**	length strings, then return the first of any instances in the
**	class space that match its valid_perms.
**
**	If the input instance does not exist or doesn't include
**	valid_perms, returns MO_NO_INSTANCE, and the output class is
**	untouched.  If there is no readable successor to the input
**	object, returns MO_NO_NEXT.
**
**	If the classid of the returned object won't fit in the provided
**	buffer, returns MO_CLASSID_TRUNCATED.  If the instance of the
**	returned object won't fit in the provided buffer, returns
**	MO_INSTANCE_TRUNCATED.  If the value returned won't fit in the
**	supplied buffer, returns MO_VALUE_TRUNCATED.  Any of these
**	truncation errors is a serious programming error, which should
**	abort processing as it may be impossible to continue a get next
**	scan from that point.  Client buffers should always be sized big
**	enough to avoid truncation, so truncation is a serious
**	programming error.  MOgetnext will not work as expected when
**	handed a truncated classid or instance for a subsequent call.
**
**	Existance of the input object is determined by calling the idx
**	method for the class with the MO_GETNEXT message.
**
**	If the call succeeds, it must also call the monitors for the
**	class with the MO_GET event, the instance id, and the current
**	value.
**  Inputs:
**	 valid_perms
**		the roles currently in effect, to be and-ed with object
**		permissions to determine access rights.
**	 lclassid
**		length of the buffer for the classid.
**	 classid
**		the classid in question.
**	 linstance
**		length of the buffer for the instance.
**	 instance
**		the instance in question.
**	 lsbufp
**		pointer to the length of the output string buffer.
**  Outputs:
**	 classid
**		filled in with the new classid.
**	 instance
**		filled in with the new instance.
**	 lsbufp
**		if *sval is NULL, contains the actual length of the value in
**		sbuf.
**	 sbuf
**		if sval is NULL, a copy of the output string.  If it
**		wasn't long enough, returns MO_VALUE_TRUNCATED.
**	 perms
**		the permissions for the returned instance.
**  Returns:
**	 OK
**		if the retrieval returned data.
**	 MO_CLASSID_TRUNCATED
**		buffer for classod was too small, and output was truncated.
**	 MO_INSTANCE_TRUNCATED
**		buffer for instance was too small and output was truncated.
**	 MO_VALUE_TRUNCATED
**		buffer for value was too small, and output was truncated.
**	 MO_NO_CLASSID
**		the input class did not exist, or it's permissions
