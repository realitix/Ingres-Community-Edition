/**
**
**  Name: moset.c -- MOset operation for MO.
**
**  Description:
**
**	This module provides a symbol table that can be used by CL and
**	mainline clients to register objects of varying types as management
**	objects.  These objects can be get/set by classid, and may be
**	scanned.
**
**  Intended Uses:
**
**	This is intended to be used by all server code that wishes to
**	export management/monitoring objects.
**
**  Interface:
**
**    The file defines the following visible functions.
**
**	MOset		set value of an object.
**
**  History:
**	26-Oct-91 (daveb)
**		Created from old mi.c
**	15-Jan-92 (daveb)
**		Updated to MO 0.9.
**	22-jan-92 (daveb)
**		Updated to MO.10
**	29-Jan-92 (daveb)
**		broke out of mogetset.c

/*{
**  Name:	MOset - set value associated with an instance
**
**  Description:
**
**	Attempts to set the value associated with the instance.
**
**	If the call succeeds, it must also call the monitors for the
**	class with the MO_SET event, the instance id, and the new value.
**  Inputs:
**	 valid_perms
**		the roles currently in effect, to be and-ed with object
**		permissions to determine access rights.
**	 class
**		the class whose value should be altered.
**	 instance
**		the instance in question.
**	 val
**		pointer to the string containing the new value.
**  Outputs:
**	 none
**  Returns:
**	 OK
**		if the value was set
**	 MO_NO_INSTANCE
**		if the class is not attached
**	 MO_NO_WRITE
**		if the class may not be changed.
**	 other
**		error status returned by a method.

**	    Permit access if MO_ANY_WRITE attribute is set.
**	24-Oct-05 (toumi01) BUG 115449
**	    Don't hold onto MO mutex if class' processing will try
**	    to take the mutex, and would thus deadlock on ourself.
