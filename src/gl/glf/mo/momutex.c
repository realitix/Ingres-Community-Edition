** History:

**	    changed to use MU sems.
**	13-Jan-1993 (daveb)
**	    Change to handle deadlock w/counting sem.
**	15-jul-93 (ed)
**	    adding <gl.h> after <compat.h>
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4

/*
** Name:  MO_mutex - obtain MO lock
**
**	Gain control of the MO mutual exclusion lock, blocking other
**	calls until a matching MO_unmutex is called.  It is a logic
**	error that may (or may not) be detected to call this from a
**	process/thread that already holds the lock.
**
** Inputs:
**	None.
**
** Outputs:
**	err	filled with detailed error status if return != OK,
**		otherwise left untouched.
**
** Returns:
**
**	OK if the mutex was acquired.  other system specific error
**	status, possibly including deadlock with self if detectable.
**
**  History:
**	24-sep-92 (daveb)
**	    documented
**	13-Jan-1993 (daveb)
**	    Handle deadlock/counting semaphore case.  All errors
**	    are treated as deadlock if the semaphore is held.
**	    This isn't stricly correct, but is all we can do since
**	    we don't know all the E_???_DEADLOCK codes that might
**	    be returned.

**          Remove erglf.h.
