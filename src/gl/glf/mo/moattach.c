/**
** Name:	moattach.c	MOattach (instance) related functions.
**
** Description:
**
**	This file defines:
**
**	MO_getinstance	- get instance of a classid, instance.
**	MOattach	- attach instances
**	MOdetach	- detach an attached instance
**	MOon_off	- enable/disable MO attach (for client programs)
**	MO_ipindex	- index method for attached instances.
**	MOidata_index	- standard index method for data of attached objects
**	MOname_index	- standard index for names of attached instances
**
** History:
**
**	15-Jan-92 (daveb)
**		Upgraded to MO.9 spec.
**	27-jan-92 (daveb)
**		upgreaded to mo.10; vastly different here, as there
**		are two trees instead of one.
**	28-Jan-92 (daveb)
**	    Null out node links in SPenq rather than here.
**	31-Jan-92 (daveb)
**	    Now we don't touch the classes.
**	15-jul-92 (daveb)
**	    Go back to single-instance attach/detach, as with
**	    MOcdata_index most bulky static one-offs will be
**	    right in the class definitions anyway, and this
**	    is simpler for the dynamic attach.
**	24-sep-92 (daveb)
**	    documented
**	13-Jan-1993 (daveb)
**	    Attach twin, if any is defined.
**	15-jul-93 (ed)
**	    adding <gl.h> after <compat.h>
**	4-Aug-1993 (daveb) 58937
**	    cast PTRs before use.
**	06-sep-1993 (tad)
**	    Bug #56449
**	    Changed %x to %p in MOattach().
**	27-jun-95 (emmag)
**	    Cleaned up the MCT changes which weren't ifdef'ed.
**	22-apr-1996 (lawst01)
**	   Windows 3.1 port changes - set BOOL variable correctly.
**	03-jun-1996 (canor01)
**	    Previous change was generic. MOmutex should be held for all
**	    calls to MO_tell_class().
**	21-jan-1999 (canor01)
**	    Remove erglf.h.
**	02-sep-1999 (somsa01)
**	    In MOdetach(), we were calling MO_tell_class() without holding
**	    the MO mutex.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**      03-nov-2010 (joea)
**          Declare MO_ipindex as static.

/*{
**  Name:	MOattach - attach instances
**
**  Description:
**
**	If MOon_off has been called with MO_DISABLE, returns OK without
**	doing anything.
**
**	Attachs an instance of a classid.  If a classid has a
**	corresponding object-id (as determined by looking up the classid
**	in the MO_META_OBJID class), it is attached under the oid as
**	well.
**
**	If the flags field contains MO_INSTANCE_VAR, then the instance
**	string will be saved in allocated space, otherwise only a
**	pointer will be kept.  The idata may be passed by the
**	MOidata_index method to the get and set methods for the class.
**	This pointer will usually identify the actual object in
**	question.
**
**	Allocates memory for the object using MEreqmem.
**
**	If the call succeeds, it must also call the monitors for the
**	class with the MO_ATTACH event, the instance id, and a NULL
**	value.
**
**  Inputs:
**	 flags
**		either 0 or MO_INSTANCE_VAR if the instance string is not in
**		stable storage.
**	 classid
**		the classid of this class.
**	 instance
**		being attached.
**	 idata
**		the value to associate with the instance, picked out by the
**		MOidata_index method and handed to get and set methods.
**  Returns:
**	 OK
**		is the object was attached successfully.
**	 MO_NO_CLASSID
**		if the classid is not defined.
**	 MO_ALREADY_ATTACHED
**		the object has already been attached.

**	13-Apr-2010 (bonro01) Bug 123570
**	    A hang can occur if MOattach calls MO_alloc which needs to
**	    call MEget_pages to allocate more pages. This results in a
**	    call to MOclassdef which also locks the MO_mutex.
**	    To eliminate this problem the MO_mutex is released before calling
