**          Added a case for i8 in MOintget but typecasted the i8 to i4 as 
**          all the MO codes are not compatible with i8.This is temporary
**          fix as scope of porting all the codes is large.Limitation of 
**          this fix being the value of the variable it can handle which
**          should not grow more than the size of i4. 
**          Bug(113797) 
**      09-Feb-2010 (smeke01) b123226, b113797 
**          Added handling of 8-byte integers. This has enabled a better

/*{
**  Name:	MOintget - standard get integer at an address method
**
**  Description:
**
**
**	Convert the integer at the object location to a character
**	string.  The offset is treated as a byte offset to the input
**	object .  They are added together to get the object location.
**	
**	The output userbuf , has a maximum length of luserbuf that will
**	not be exceeded.  If the output is bigger than the buffer, it
**	will be chopped off and MO_VALUE_TRUNCATED returned.
**
**	The objsize comes from the class definition, and is the length
**	of the integer, one of sizeof(i1), sizeof(i2), or
**	sizeof(i4).
**  Inputs:
**	 offset
**		value from the class definition, taken as byte offset to the
**		object pointer where the data is located.
**	 objsize
**		the size of the integer, from the class definition.
**	 object
**		a pointer to the integer to convert.
**	 luserbuf
**		the length of the user buffer.
**	 userbuf
**		the buffer to use for output.
**  Outputs:
**	 userbuf
**		contains the string of the value of the instance.
**  Returns:
**	 OK
**		if the operation succeseded
**	 MO_VALUE_TRUNCATED
**		the output buffer was too small, and the string was truncated.
**	 other
**		conversion-specific failure status as appropriate.
