/* original comments:
**
**  The code implements the following operations on an event-set
**  or priority-queue implemented using splay trees:
**  
**  SPTREE *SPinit( compare )	Make a new tree
**  int SPempty();		Is tree empty?
**  SPBLK *SPenq( n, t )	Insert n in t after all equal keys.
**  SPBLK *SPdeq( np )		Return first key under *np, removing it.
**  SPBLK *SPenqprior( n, t )	Insert n in t before all equal keys.
**  VOID SPsplay( n, t )	n (already in q) becomes the root.
**  n = SPhead( t )		n is the head item in t (not removed).
**  SPdelete( n, t )		n is removed from q.
**  n = SPnext( np, t )		n is the successor of np in q.
**  n = SPprev( np, t )		n is the predecessor of np in q.
**  SPenqbefore( n, np, t )	n becomes the predecessor of np in q.
**  SPenqafter( n, np, t )	n becomes the successor of np in q.
**
**  In the above, n points to an SPBLK type, while t points to an
**  SPTREE.
**
**  Many of the routines in this package use the splay procedure,
**  for bottom-up splaying of the queue.  Consequently, item n in
**  delete and item np in all operations listed above must be in the
**  event-set prior to the call or the results will be
**  unpredictable (eg:  chaos will ensue).
**  
**  Note that, in all cases, these operations can be replaced with
**  the corresponding operations formulated for a conventional
**  lexicographically ordered tree.  The versions here all use the
**  splay operation to ensure the amortized bounds; this usually
**  leads to a very compact formulation of the operations
**  themselves, but it may slow the average performance.
**  
**  Alternative versions based on simple binary tree operations are
**  provided (commented out) for head, next, and prev, since these
**  are frequently used to traverse the entire data structure, and
**  the cost of traversal is independent of the shape of the
**  structure, so the extra time taken by splay in this context is
**  wasted.
**  
**  The implementation used here is based on the implementation
**  which was used in the tests of splay trees reported in:
**
**    An Empirical Comparison of Priority-Queue and Event-Set Implementations,
**	by Douglas W. Jones, Comm. ACM 29, 4 (Apr. 1986) 300-311.
**
**  The changes made include the addition of the enqprior
**  operation and the addition of up-links to allow for the splay
**  operation.  The basic splay tree algorithms were originally
**  presented in:
**
**	Self Adjusting Binary Trees,
**		by D. D. Sleator and R. E. Tarjan,
**			Proc. ACM SIGACT Symposium on Theory
**			of Computing (Boston, Apr 1983) 235-245.
**
**  The enq and enqprior routines use variations on the
**  top-down splay operation, while the splay routine is bottom-up.
**  All are coded for speed.

**    Douglas W. Jones

**    David Brower, daveb@rtech.uucp,
**    Published as comp.sources.unix v14i087, May 1988.
**
**  Thu Oct  6 12:11:33 PDT 1988 (daveb) Fixed SPdeq, which was broken
** 	handling one-node trees.  I botched the pascal translation of
** 	a VAR parameter.  Changed interface, so callers must also be
**	corrected to pass the node by address rather than value.
