/**CL_SPEC
** Name: LG.H - Logging Primitives.  (GL version)
**
** Description:
**      This file contains the definitions of types, functions and constants
**	needed to make calls on the compatibility library LG functions.  These
**	routines performs all logging services for the DMF. Furthermore, non-DMF
**	uses of the LG routines are prohibited by definition.
**
**  NOTE: This file is now in the GL! This means that a common version of this
**	  file is shared among ALL systems. Changes to this file must be
**	  submitted to the CL committee for approval.
**
** Specification:
**
**   Description:
**	Log file operations required for support of transaction logging.
**
**   Intended Uses:
**	The LG services are intended for use by the DMF code to manage the
**	log file and its associated memory resident data structures.  The log
**	file contains a sequence of log records that describe the operations
**	performed on database objects by the DMF code.  These log file records
**      are used to recover database objects which are left in an inconsistent
**	state in the event of a software, hardware or user initiatated failure.
**      The log records can also be used to represent a history of changes to the
**	database.
**	
**   Assumptions:
**	It is assumed that the reader is familar with the basic concepts of
**	a write-ahead log (WAL).
**
**	The host operating system needs to have the capability of guaranteeing
**	that the log data has been safely written to the log file.
**
**	The actual log file can be implemented using a DI type file of the
**	appropriate block size, or by a specific implementation for LG type
**	files.
**
**	The performance of the LG routines is paramount to the performance of
**	the transaction logging, archiving and recovery system.  Special care
**	should be taken to insure that the LG routines, especially LGwrite,
**	are implemented in a efficent manner.
**
**   Definitions:
**   
**(	Archive		    - This describes the process of purging the log
**			      file of log records which are stale or that have
**			      been safely copied to secondary permanent storage.
**			      This secondary permanent storage is called a 
**			      journal file and is managed by the JF CL routines.
**			      The program that performs these operations is called
**			      the 'archiver'.
**			      
**
**	Consistency point   - A consistency point is a special set of log
**			      records that are written to the log file at
**			      periodic intervals.  The consistency point is used
**			      in the crash recovery process to aid in locating
**			      the last log page written, the set of open
**			      databases, and the set of active transactions.
**			      Without a consistency point, the whole log file
**			      would have to be searched to locate the last page
**			      written, and to recalculate the set of databases
**			      and transactions.
**
**			      The interval between consistency points can be
**			      set by the client.  For example: the DMF recovery
**			      process sets the consistency point interval when
**			      it is started.
**
**	Database	    - The logging system maintains a small set of
**			      information about an object which it calls a 
**			      database (equivalent to an INGRES database.)
**			      This information is used to track usage of a
**			      database, to tag log records with the database that
**			      they belong to, to find the disk location of the
**			      database for the recovery system.
**
**			      An LG call exists to return all the internal
**			      information about a database.  The structure
**			      LG_DATABASE describes the form of this
**			      information.
**
**	Database_id	    - The LG system assigns a unique identifer to every
**			      database it handles. This identifer is used
**			      by other LG calls to identify a specific database.
**
**	Event		    - The logging system remembers when certain events
**			      have occured that a client should handle.  These
**			      events include: the need to write a consistency
**			      point, archivable data exists in the log file,
**			      a process terminated leaving a transaction in-
**			      progress.  The client code is expected to handle
**			      the event and then clear the event with a call
**			      to LGalter().  For example:  the DMF recovery
**			      process waits for the event associated with
**			      consistency point generation.  The following 
**                            events are defined.
**

**
**	Log Address	    - When log records are written to the log file, the
**			      log record is assigned a number called the log
**			      address.  The log address represents the location
**			      in the log file where the record was written.
**			      The log address points to the offset of the last
**			      log word containing data for this log record.
**
**			      The log address is composed of three components:
**			      the log sequence number, the log page number, and
**			      the log word offset.  The log sequence number
**			      counts the number of times that log addresses have
**			      wrapped around to the beginning of the circular
**			      log file.  The log page number, is a number from
**			      1 to the number of pages in the log file.  The log
**			      word offset is a number from 0 to the size of a
**			      log page minus 4 (i.e. if log page size = 4096 then
**			      maximum log word offset would be 4092).
**
**			      The log address is designed to fit into a 64-bit
**			      word.  The sequence number always uses 32-bits.
**			      The page number and the offset vary in size
**			      depending on the size of a log page.  The offset
**			      uses as many bits as needed to represent an offset
**			      for a log page size of 4096..32768 bytes.  The
**			      page uses the remaining bits after accounting for
**			      the number of bits in the offset.
**
**			      +-----------------------------------------------+
**			      | Sequence:32 | Page:(17..21) | Offset:(15..11) |
**			      +-----------------------------------------------+
**
**			      The minimum sequence number is 2.  The minimum
**			      page number is 1.
**
**			      The structure LG_LA defines a log address.
**
**	Log File	    - The log file is an operating system file that is 
**			      used to contain the log pages.  The log file
**			      if logically composed of two parts: the log file
**			      header and the log file data.
**
**			      The log file header contains information about the
**			      log file.  See 'Log Header'.
**
**			      The log file data area encompasses log pages 1
**			      through the number of pages in the log file.  When
**			      the last physical log page has been written,
**			      physical page 1 becomes the next log page 
**			      (I.E. a circular file.)  The log address has
**			      its sequence number field incremented when this
**			      wraparound occurs.
**
**
**			      +---------------------------------------------+
**			      | Page 0  | Page 1 | Page 2 | Page 3 | Page 4 |
**			      |         |        |        |        |        |
**			      |   Log   | (2,1)  | (2,2)  | (2,3)  | (2,4)  |
**			      | Header  |        |        |        |        |
**			      +---------------------------------------------+
**
**	Log Header	    - The first page (page 0) of the log file is called
**			      the log header.  The log header contains
**			      information that describes the log file.  This
**			      information includes: the log file format version,
**			      the log header checksum, the log page size, the
**			      number of log pages, the log file status
**			      indicators, the log address of the beginning of
**			      file, the log address of the end of file, and the
**			      log address of the last consistency point.
**
**			      Various LG calls exist to read, change and write
**			      the log file header.
**
**			      The structure LG_HEADER describes the log header.
**
**	Log Page	    - A log page is composed of two components: the log
**			      page header and the log page data area.  The log
**			      page header contains the following information:
**			      the log address of the last complete log
**			      record written to the page, the checksum of the
**			      log page, the number of bytes used on this log page,
**			      and an extra field that is initialized to zero.
**
**			      The log address of the last full log record is 
**			      used to position to a full record on an arbitary
**			      page.  If the log address offset is zero then
**			      either nothing was written to the page or a
**			      very long log record that spans multiple pages
**			      was written to this page.
**
**			      The checksum is used to guarantee that the log
**			      was successfully written and subsequently read
**			      from the log file.  The checksum includes the log
**			      page header and chunks of data from various sections
**			      of the log page.  The contents of the whole log
**			      are not included because of the cost in CPU
**			      resources.
**
**			      The internal format of the log page is known to
**			      the client.  The crash recovery code uses the
**			      log page header information to locate the last
**			      log page written.
**
**	Log Record	    - A log record is composed of two components: the
**			      log record header(LRH) and the log record data area.
**
**			      The client log record is encapsulated in a log
**			      record header constructed by the LG routines.
**			      This header contains the following information:
**			      the length of the encapsulated log record, the
**			      database identifier for the database this log
**			      record was written for, the transaction identifer
**			      of the transaction which wrote the log record,
**			      the sequence number of this log record relative
**			      to the beginning of the transaction, the log
**			      address of the previous log record written by
**			      this transaction, the client log record, and
**			      again the length of the encapsulated log record.
**                            Both LRH and the length at the end are returned
**                            to the caller as well as the record.
**
**			      The length of the log record is stored on both
**			      ends of the log record to facilitate forward and
**			      backward traversal of the log records.  This
**                            information is for use of the LG routines for
**                            reading forward or backward and for the use
**                            of the client.
**
**			      Encapsulated log records are always rounded up
**			      to a multiple of a log word (see below).
**
**			      Client log records have a maximum size denoted by
**			      the constant LG_MAX_RSZ (Currently 4096).
**
**			      The part of the log record header that occurs
**			      before the client data cannot span a log page.
**
**	Log Word	    - This is the minimum unit of allocation for a log
**			      page and is 4 bytes.  All log records are 
**                            padded to be a multiple of log words so that 
**                            information is stored on
**			      aligned boundaries in the log file, thus allowing
**			      direct access to structures stored in the log
**			      file.  This also guarantees that each of the
**			      length fields in a log record never spans a page.
**                            The pad bytes are sent back to the client.
**
**	Logging_id	    - The LG system assigns a unique identifer to every
**			      process that opens the log file. This identifer
**			      is used by other LG calls to determine which
**			      process is making the request.
** 
**	Master		    - The logging system recognizes one process that
**			      has the log file open as the master process.  The
**			      master process is given the ability to alter any
**			      of the logging system data structures.
**
**			    - The master is responsible for initializing the
**			      logging system and for determining the
**			      operational policies.
**
**	Position Context    - Read operations from the log file require a
**			      context area to maintain position information
**			      between successive requests.  The LGposition()
**			      call initializes a client supplied data area
**			      and successive LGread() calls update this context.
**			      The size of the context area is denoted by the
**			      constant LG_MAX_CTX.
**
**	Transaction	    - The logging system maintains a small set of 
**			      information about transactions that are in
**			      progress.  This information is used to track
**			      the progress of an active transaction. The
**			      information recorded about a transaction 
**			      includes:  the physical transaction identifier,
**			      the database the transaction is using, the number
**			      of log records written by this transaction, the
**			      log address of the first log record for the
**			      transaction, the log address of the last log
**			      record for the transaction.
**
**			      An LG call exists to return all the internal
**			      information about a transaction.  The structure
**			      LG_TRANSACTION describes the form of this
**			      information.
**
**	Transaction_id	    - The LG system assigns a unique identifer to every
**			      transaction that is started.  This identifier is
**			      used by other LG calls to determine the transaction
**			      that is being referenced.  This is different than
**			      the external transaction identifer that is also
**			      assigned at the same time.  The external
**			      transaction identifer is used by distributed
**			      to remember the transactions at each site which
**			      comprise a distributed transaction.
**
**)
**   Concepts:
**
**	The LG routines provide the low level support for maintaining the
**	memory resident data structures associated with the log file.
**	The actions that these routines perform handle the majority of the
**	normal processing performed by the logging system.  These actions
**	include:  reading the log file, writing the log file, writing the
**	log file header, maintaining the logging system data structures.
**
**	The client is responsible for rare, time consuming, and complicated
**	processing.  This type of processing include; verifing the integrity
**	of the log file, initializing the memory resident copy of the log
**	file header, writing consistency points, resolving transactions
**	that have been orphaned, initializing the log file.  These actions
**	require that decisions be made and the appropriate changes sent
**	to the logging system.
**
**	The logging system notifies the client of certain events that the
**	client may wish to handle.  The logging system records that a
**	specific event has occured. The client can recognize an event
**	one of three ways: the client can wait for a specific event to
**	occur, the client can wait for any event in a set of events to
**	occur or the client can poll the current event settings.
**  
**	In the following example, the division of labor between the client
**	and the logging system is outlined.
**
**(	    o  The client initializes the logging system and sets the beginning
**	       of file and the end of file addresses.
**
**	    o  The logging system will allow writes to occur to the log file as
**	       long as space exists in the log file.
**
**	    o  When the log file is full, the logging system posts an event
**             (LG_E_LOGFULL) that signifies that the log file is full.  
**             All further writes
**	       to the log will be stalled until the enough free space has
**             been obtained to bring the file below its full indicator.
**             The recovery process and archiver are responsible for
**	       freeing up space in the log file.
**
**	    o  The client must free up space in the log file and reset the
**	       beginning of file address.  Once the beginning of file address
**	       is changed, the logging system will restart any log writes in-
**	       progress and allow new log writes.
**
**	    o  When the client wishes to stop the logging system, the client
**	       sets the shutdown flag.
**
**	    o  When the logging system notices the shutdown flag has been set
**	       it disallows any new transactions from starting.  When the last
**	       transaction has completed, the logging system will post the event
**	       signifying that shutdown is complete.
**)
**	The logging system is the mechanism for manipulating the log file.  The
**	client is responsible for setting the policy on how the log file should
**	be manipulated.
**
**	The logging system recognizes one process that has the log file open
**	as a master process.  The master process is the special process that is
**	allowed to change any of the logging systems internal data structures.
**	The master process is the process that sets the policy.  The master
**	process must exist before any other process can start.  If the master
**	process terminates, all other processes will receive errors from
**	succeeding logging system calls.
**
**	The logging system data structures can be displayed by using the
**	LGshow() routine.  This routine can return any of the information that
**	the logging system maintains.
**
**	The logging system data structures can be changed by using the
**	LGalter() routine.  This routine can change most of the information
**	that the logging system maintains. For example the log page can be 
**      set to one of the following sizes: 4096, 8192, 16384,
**	32768.
**
**	The log file can be up to 4G bytes in size.
**
**	The log file can be mirrored (duplexed, shadowed) across multiple
**	physical devices so as to eliminate a single point of failure, and
**	the real threat of lost data.  The log file contains the most recent
**	state of the database.  If the log file is lost the databases can be
**	restored to a previous point in time, but some amount of work will be
**	lost.

**          Reduced logging project.
**	      - Add LG_LSN definition.
**	18-sep-92 (ed)
**	    Made changes related to increasing DB_MAXNAME to 32
**	16-oct-1992 (jnash) merged 10-oct-1992 (rogerk)
**	    Reduced logging project.
**	      Added PR_CPAGENT process status for LG_PROCESS structure.
**	      Added LG_A_CPAGENT mode for LGalter calls.
**	12-oct-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Fix tr_status bit definitions following LG/LK mainline changes.
**	20-oct-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Add new LGalter codes: LG_A_GCMT_THRESHOLD, LG_A_GCMT_NUMTICKS.
**	2-nov-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Add LG_N_BUFFER and the LG_BUFFER type for logstat use.
**	17-nov-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Add prototype for LGidnum_from_id().
**	11-jan-1993 (jnash)
**	    Reduced logging project.  Add LG_A_RES_SPACE.
**	18-jan-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Added LGalter option LG_A_LXB_OWNER.
**	08-feb-1993 (jnash)
**	    Added LGreserve FUNC_EXTERN.
**	15-mar-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Reduced Logging - Phase IV:  Added external database id information
**		to the LG_DATABASE and LG_TRANSACTION structures.  Also included
**		last-journal-address in LG_DATABASE info block.
**	    Removed LG_ADDONLY flag.  Recovery processing now uses normal LGadd.
**	    Removed LG_A_JCP_ADDR_SET, LG_A_EBACKUP, LG_A_PURGEDB
**		and LG_A_SONLINE_PURGE alter cases.  These are no longer used.
**	    Removed LG_S_CDATABASE, LG_S_LDATABASE, LG_S_ABACKUP, LG_S_JNLDB,
**		and LG_S_PURJNLDB show cases.  These are no longer used.
**		Changed LG_S_DATABASE case to now return db information for a 
**		database identified by the lpd id.
**	    Removed LG_E_1PURGE_ACTIVE, LG_E_2PURGE_COMPLETE event states.
**	    Removed DB_EBACKUP database state.
**	    Added LG_A_DBCONTEXT alter event.
**	    Added LG_A_ARCHIVE_DONE alter event.
**	    Added LG_NORESERVE flag to LGbegin.
**	15-mar-1993 (jnash)
**	    B49941. Bump LG_MAX_RSZ from 4132 to 4232.  Apparently this 
**	    number can be increased until it approaches twice the minimum log 
**	    block size (currently 4096).
**	26-apr-1993 (bryanp)
**	    6.5 Cluster support:
**		Renamed the LG_LA components to la_sequence and la_offset, as
**		    part of replacing the DM_LOG_ADDR type with the LG_LA type.
**		Modified prototype for LGforce since it now works with LSNs.
**		Removed LPS field from LGread, since it no longer returns a
**		    Log Page Stamp.
**		Deleted prototypes for LGC* routines which no longer exist,
**		    including: LGCalter, LGCopen, LGCclose, LGCforce,
**		    LGCposition, LGCread, LGCshow, LGCwrite.
**		Added prototype for LGCn_name().
**		Added new LG_FULL_FILENAME and LG_ONELOG_ONLY flags to LGopen
**		    for use by standalone logdump.
**		Added new LGalter/LGshow code LG_A_NODELOG_HEADER to set and
**		    examine the header for a particular node's log.
**		Don't automatically cast the arguments in the LSN and LGA
**		    comparison macros. This helps ensure that callers pass the
**		    correct argument types to this macros (i.e., they don't pass
**		    the address of an LG_LA to an LSN comparison macro, etc.).
**		Add db_sback_lsn to the LG_DATABASE for showing the LSN of the
**		    start of the backup.
**		Add LG_S_CSP_PID to show the CSP Process ID.
**		Added the gross argument-passing structure LG_HDR_ALTER_SHOW to
**		    support showing and altering the header for a non-local log
**		    file.
**	21-jun-1993 (andys)
**	    Add FUNC_EXTERN LG_cluster_node. 
**	    Change LGcopy, LGerase interfaces.
**	    Replace LG_NOHEADER with LG_LOG_INIT.
**	21-jun-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Added LG_IGNORE_BOF flag to cause LGopen to do the logfile
**	    scan for bof_eof even if the logfile header status indicates that
**	    the bof/eof values in the header are valid.  This can be used by
**	    logdump to dump entire logfiles.
**	26-jul-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Changed journal and dump window tracking in the logging system.
**	    Use new journal and dump log address fields.  Changed LG_DATABASE
**	    struct fields to reflect this.  Changed LG show options to find
**	    the system dump and journal windows - they are now combined
**	    into a single archive window.
** 	26-jul-1993 (jnash)
**	    Add LGinit_lock() FUNC EXTERN.  
**      09-sep-1993 (smc)
**          Changed LG_DBID to be a PTR so that it can continue to be
**          used to hold addresses on 64 bit machines.
** 	20-sep-1993 (jnash)
**	    Add LGreserve() "flag" param and LG_RS_FORCE flag value.
**	18-oct-93 (rogerk)
**	    Added new information for LGshow transaction calls:
**	        TR_ORPHAN, TR_NORESERVE transaction status flags.
**		tr_reserved_space - amount of log file space reserved by xact.
**          Changed LG_DBID back to be a i4.  Change will probably
**	    conflict with 64 bit integration which is planning the same change.
**	    Added alter options: LG_A_CACHE_FACTOR, LG_A_UNRESERVE_SPACE
**      23-may-1994 (jnash)
**          Add LGalter LG_A_LFLSN option and the LG_LFLSN_ALTER structure, 
**	    used to initialize the logging system "last forced lsn".
**	08-Dec-1995 (jenjo02)
**	    Added LG_S_MUTEX function to LGshow(), LG_MUTEX structure in
**	    which logging system semaphore stats are returned.
**	06-mar-1996 (stial01 for bryanp)
**        Increased LG_MAX_RSZ to allow logging 64K before images for the
**            multiple page size project.
**	22-Apr-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Added lgs_no_logwriter, count of times we needed a logwriter
**	    thread but none were available.
**	01-Oct-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Added lgs_max_wq, the maximum number of log buffers queued
**	    on a write queue, and lgs_max_wq_count, the number of time
**	    that max was encountered.
**	06-Nov-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Changed LG_E_xxxxxxxx values to match those in in lgdstatus.h
**	    to avoid a lengthy hold of the lgd_status_mutex while 
**	    transforming from LGD to LG_E_ values in LG_event().
**      22-nov-96 (stial01,dilma04)
**          Row Locking Project:
**          Added LG_S_ETRANSACTION for getting transaction information
**          for a specific external transaction id
**	13-jun-1997 (wonst02)
** 	    Added DB_READONLY status for readonly databases.

**	    Partitioned Log File Project:
**	    Added LG_MAX_FILE define.
**	    Added lgh_partitions to LG_HEADER.
**	02-feb-1998 (hanch04)
**	    Created LG_OLA from LG_LA for upgrade of CNF_V4 and earlier

**	29-Sep-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Added LG_S_SAMP_STAT LGshow function for the
**	    sampler.
**      15-Nov-2000 (hweho01)
**          Increased LG_MAX_RSZ from 66100 to 66112, make it 
**          in the 8-byte boundary, prevent unaligned access fault   
**          in Compaq 64-bit platform (axp_osf).
**	12-apr-2002 (devjo01)
**	    Remove obsolete constants related to NODES.
**      11-jul-2002 (stial01)

**	    Added LGconnect() functionality for Partitioned
**	    Table, Parallel Query project.
**      18-feb-2004 (stial01)
**          Increased LG_MAX_RSZ for 256k row support. (Now that the i2 limit
**          row size limit has been lifted, the maximum row size for 64k pages
**          has been increased - so DM0L_REP log records can be bigger.)
**	08-Apr-2004 (jenjo02)
**	    Added LG_A_BMINI, LG_A_EMINI, TR_IN_MINI
**	20-Apr-2004 (jenjo02)

**	    Moved transaction wait reason defines here from lgdef.h
**	21-Mar-2006 (jenjo02)
**	    Add LG_A_OPTIMWRITE, LG_A_OPTIMWRITE_TRACE
**      31-mar-2006 (stial01)
**          Renamed LG_E_JSWITCHDONE to LG_E_ARCHIVE_DONE. The archiver always 
**          sends LG_E_ARCHIVE_DONE, and JSP alterdb -next_jnl_file verifies
**          if the archiver did the switch or not. Removed LG_A_DJSWITCH.
**	21-Jun-2006 (jonj)
**	    Add LG_A_LOCKID, LG_A_TXN_STATE, LG_DUPLICATE_TXN,
**	    LG_NO_TRANSACTION, LG_XA_START_XA, LG_XA_START_JOIN
**	    for XA integration.

**	    For supportability add process info to shared memory.
**      20-Jun-2007 (hanal04) Bug 118531
**          Explicitly define LGbegin's flag values as i4's. On i64.hpu
**          the define's were not automatically compiled as i4's and this
**          lead to spurious behaviour in LGbegin().
**      11-May-2007 (stial01)
**          Added LG_S_COMMIT_WILLING, LG_S_ROLLBACK_WILLING
**      28-jan-2008 (stial01)
**          Redo/undo error handling during offline recovery via rcpconfig.
**      31-jan-2008 (stial01)
**          Added -rcp_stop_lsn, to set II_DMFRCP_STOP_ON_INCONS_DB
**      02-may-2008 (horda03) Bug 120349
**          Added LG_WAIT_REASON define.
**      30-Oct-2009 (horda03) Bug 122823
**          Added LG_PARTITION_FILENAMES to signal to LGopen() that the
**          filename paramter is a pointer to an array of LG_PARTIONs.
**          Added LG_PARTITON structure to hold details on the filenames
**          of a partitioned TX log file. When LG_PARTITION_FILENAMES flag
**          set, l_filename refers to the number of partitons.
**	10-Nov-2009 (kschendel) SIR 122757
**	    Remove l_context param from LGread.
**	16-Nov-2009 (kschendel) SIR 122890
**	    Remove lx_id param from LGerase.  Delete LGidnum_from_id.
**	15-Jan-2010 (jonj)
**	    SIR 121619 MVCC:
**	    Define new structure LG_LRI as output param to LGwrite() instead
**	    of LG_LSN. LGwrite populates it with everything about the write,
**	    lg_id, LSN, LGA, journal sequence and offset.
**	    Define new structure LG_CRIB to be populated by LGshow(LG_S_CRIB)
**	    to establish point-in-time values for consistent read.
**	    Add LGshow(LG_S_XID_ARRAY_SIZE) to return size of active xid array.
**	    LG_S_XID_ARRAY_PTR to return a pointer to it.
**	    Formalize JFA (Journal File Address) as a LG_JFA structure.
**	04-Feb-2010 (jonj)
**	    SIR 121619 MVCC: Add bufid to LGread() prototype.
**	08-Feb-2010 (jonj)
**	    SIR 121619 MVCC: Add LG_LGID_INTERNAL structure for use by
**	    LOG_ID_ID macro to extract just the id_id, avoiding endian issues.
**	17-Feb-2010 (jonj)
**	    SIR 121619 MVCC: Add LG_A_RBBLOCKS, LG_A_RFBLOCKS, LG_S_RBBLOCKS,
**	    LG_S_RFBLOCKS for buffered log reads.
**      01-apr-2010 (stial01)
**          Changes for Long IDs
**      09-aug-2010 (maspa05) b123189, b123960
**          Added LG_RODB and DB_RODB to indicate readonly database.
**          Logging system needs to know if a database is readonly so that it
**          can indicate (via LGshow) to RCP. 
**	04-Jan-2011 (jonj) SIR 124894 LG/LK/IPM unification
**	    Added LG_H_INCLUDED; lgdef.h now includes lg.h.
**	    This file is now the repository for all public and private
**	    bit definitions and string equivalents. Added LGH_STATUS,
**	    PR_STATUS, LG_BUF_STATE string defines.
**      30-Mar-2011 (horda03) b124968
**          Added LG_ARCHIVER_TO_PROCESS flag to instruct LGwrite that the log
**          record is one that requires processing by the Archiver (so ensures
**          the Archiver start/end window straddles the record).

** Name: LG_HEADER - LG log file header information.
**
** Description:
**      This structure can be passed to LGshow() and LGalter() to inquire
**	about the contents of the header, or to change the contents of the
**	header in memory.  LGforce actually writes the changed header page
**      to disk.
**
**	The lgh_status field is used primarily during startup processing by
**	the RCP, ACP, and CSP. While the logging system (& RCP) are up and
**	running, the header status is LGH_VALID.
**
**	The various LGH_* values for lgh_status have the following meaning:
**
**	    LGH_VALID	--  The logging system is up and running. The RCP (or
**			    the CSP) has completed machine failure recovery.
**			    If the header is in this state when the RCP starts
**			    up, the RCP must have crashed, so the logging system
**			    scans from the last CP to find the correct EOF.
**	    LGH_RECOVER	--  Machine failure recovery is needed, but the BOF,
**			    EOF, and last-CP addresses in the log file header
**			    have all be verified. This value is set by the RCP
**			    if it is shutdown with "rcpconfig imm_shutdown" and
**			    is also set during machine failure recovery after
**			    the RCP has scanned backward and verified the last
**			    Consistency Point in the log file (dmr_get_cp()).
**	    LGH_EOF_OK	--  The logging system has scanned the log file and has
**			    located the true EOF position. The RCP can now
**			    proceed to verify the BOF and last-CP addresses.
**	    LGH_BAD	--  The log file is unusable. An error occurred while
**			    reading the log file header, or an error occurred
**			    while scanning backward to find the last CP. The
**			    only thing that can be done with this log file is
**			    to re-initialize it.
**	    LGH_OK	--  The RCP is not (yet) up, but the log file has been
**			    recovered and archived, if necessary. This
**			    state is similar to LGH_VALID, but indicates a
**			    certainty that no recovery action is needed. This
**			    state is set by the RCP during normal shutdown. It
**			    is also set by LGerase() after erasing the log file.
**			    Finally, it is set by the CSP in two different ways:
**			    1) After startup processing and performed both
**			    recovery AND archiving of this node's log, and
**			    2) After performing node-failure recovery of this
**			    node's log.
**
**			    LGH_OK is the only log file state (other than
**			    LGH_BAD) in which "rcpconfig init" is allowed.
**
**	During typical recovery from a system failure, the log file progresses
**	through its various stages as follows:
**	1) log file is in LGH_VALID state at startup.
**	2) logging system scans forward from last CP and determines true EOF.
**	    Logging system sets status to LGH_EOF_OK
**	3) RCP notices that state is EOF_OK and scans backward from EOF to find
**	    last Consistency Point. RCP then sets state to LGH_RECOVER.
**	4) RCP performs machine failure recovery, and then sets LGH_VALID, and
**	    system is now ready for use again.

**          Created.
**	30-oct-1991 (bryanp)

**	    Added lgh_timestamp and lgh_active_logs. These fields are used by

**	    discrepancies between headers to be resolved in favor of the one
**	    with the greater timestamp.
