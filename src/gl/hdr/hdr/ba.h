/* 
** Name:	BA.c	- Define Block Allocator function externs
**
** Specification:
** 	The block-allocation module helps in allocating and deallocating 
**	memory units in a "block" fashion; i.e, instead of allocating one
**	structure at a time, a bunch of structures are allocated in one shot.
**	The module automatically takes care of memory alignment
**	(i.e each allocated structure will be correctly aligned in memory).
**	There is separate algorithm for fixed and variable length units.
**	When a new block is allocated, either the area is formatted as
**	separate pieces of free fixed length memory, or it is formatted as
**	a single piece of free variable length memory.  When a piece of fixed
**	memory is requested, the first of the free list is unchained and
**	given to the caller.  When a piece of variable memory is requested,
**	the free chain is searched for a piece large enough to satisfy the 
**	request.  If one is found, the requested piece is carved from the 
**	free area.  The length is updated.  The free chain is kept in
**	address sequence for VL units, so that two separate pieces can be 
**	globbed together to form a single larger space.
**
**	When a block-allocator is created, minimum and maximum values can be
**  	specified for the number of blocks to allocate. The minimum value
**  	ensures that a certain number of blocks are always kept allocated.
**  	The maximum value ensures that too many blocks are not allocated. If
**  	a block becomes free and more than the minimum are allocated, then
**  	that block will be deallocated.
**
** Description:
**	Contains BA function externs

** History:
**	23-Feb-1998 (shero03)
**	    initial creation (based on blksrc in SQLBASE) 
**	25-Jun-1998 (shero03)
**	    Combine VUnitAlloc and FUnitAlloc
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
