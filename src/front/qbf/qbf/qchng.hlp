     This form contains a list of fields that will be displayed on the
     form for the current Join Definition.  You browse through these 
     fields on a table-by-table basis.  Any field(s) that you decide not 
     to display on the form can be removed with the "Delete" command.  
     This gives you the flexibility to make a table field narrower and/or 
     a form smaller.  You can further customize the form by using the 
     Visual Forms Editor (VIFRED).

     The fields on this form are:

     Field Name                 Description
     ----------                 -----------
     Table                      Name (or abbreviation) of a table in the
                                JoinDef.  The current list of fields
                                corresponds to the columns in this table.
     ColumnName                 List of displayed columns for the table.
     FieldName                  List of field names that correspond to the
                                columns of the table.

                                over from the list of displayed fields.
                                (Deleting columns has no impact on the table(s)
                                in the database ).
                                NOTE: you cannot delete a join field.
     Undo                       Backout the effects of the last "Delete" or
                                "Undo" action.
