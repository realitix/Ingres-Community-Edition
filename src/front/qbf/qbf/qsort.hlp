You can specify the sorting order for record retrieval.  This sorting order
will stay in effect until it is changed or the execution phase is terminated.

For those fields or columns you want sorted, place a sort sequence number in
the corresponding data window.  The sequence number must be an integer
between 1 and 300, optionally followed by an 'a' or 'd' for ascending or
descending order, respectively. By default the fields are sorted in ascending 
order.  When retrieving data in retrieve or update mode, the field with the
lowest sequence number will be sorted first, the field with the succeeding
sequence number will be sorted next, etc.

If a master/detail joindef is the query target, the sequence numbers of the
master fields must precede the sequence numbers of the detail fields.

The Command Menu contains the following:

        Command         Function
        -------         --------

        Blank           Clear all the fields of any sort sequences.
        Cancel          Return to query mode without making any changes
                        to the current sorting order.
        Help            Print this message
        End             Set the sorting order to what is specified in this
                        form and return to query mode.
