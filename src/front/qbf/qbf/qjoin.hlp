     This form is used to view and/or modify the join fields for the current
     Join Definition.  The Join Information Table contains the join fields
     for the Join Definition (JoinDef).  QBF chooses default join fields by
     matching column names between the tables of the Join Definition.  You
     may change or add to these values by entering the desired join pairs in
     the Join Information Table.  The columns which participate in the join
     pair are designated in the form table.column_name, where "table" should
     be the table abbreviation if one has been given.  Otherwise the table
     name itself should be used.  You may delete a join by clearing the Column
     fields for the join pair.

     The fields on this form are:

     Field Name                 Description
     ----------                 -----------
     Column                     Designation of column to be used in join pair.
     Join                       Type of join specified. QBF fills in this
                                value for you.  Possible join types are:
                                Master/Detail (MD), Detail/Master (DM),
                                Master/Master (MM) or Detail/Detail (DD).
     Column                     Designation of column to be used in join pair.

     In addition to the Join Information, the form contains a table field
     you can use to get help on a table in the database.  Help is obtained
     by filling in the "Table" field with the table name or abbreviation for
     which you want more information and selecting the GetTableDef menuitem.
     This part of the form contains the following fields:

     Field Name                 Description
     ----------                 -----------
     Table                      Field to specify a table name (or abbreviation)
                                about which you need more information.
     Column                     Column name in the table whose name is in
                                the field "Table".
     Data Type                  Data type of the column in table "Table".


     The following commands are on the QBF Join Specification Form:

     Command                    Function
     -------                    --------
     Rules                      Go to the Update and Delete Rules form.
     GetTableDef                Get help on the table(s) specified.
     Cancel                     Return to the QBF Table Entry form without
                                modifying the join information.
     ListChoices                Produce a list of available fields or tables 
                                to choose from.

     End                        Return to the QBF Table Entry form. Join
                                information is modified to reflect the values
                                currently in the Join Information table. Any 
                                errors found in the new join specifications
                                are reported by QBF. You are then asked to 
                                correct them rather than returning to the 
                                Table Entry form.
