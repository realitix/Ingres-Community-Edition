Query By Forms (QBF) is an interactive, visually oriented forms interface
package for adding, deleting, changing and viewing data in your tables.

The tasks you perform in QBF are divided into two phases: JOIN DEFINITION
and QUERY EXECUTION.  In the DEFINITION phase you specify the tables you  
wish to query.  Then, in the EXECUTION phase you query those tables and
browse or update the data.

You are now in QBF's start-up menu.  From this menu, you can execute various
commands to get information about the tables in your database or define a join
(go to QBF Join Definition phase) and run a query (go to QBF Query Execution 
phase).  To enter a command just type the name of the command followed by a
carriage return.

Commands for QBF's start-up menu are:

        Command                 Function
        -------                 --------
        QBFNames                Summon the QBF QBFNames catalog.  You can
                                browse through a list of all QBFNames (links
                                between a VIFRED form and a table), and select
                                a QBFName to run.
        JoinDefs                Summon the QBF JoinDefs catalog. You can
                                browse through the list of Join Definitions
                                (JoinDefs) stored in the database, and select
                                a Join Definition to run. You can create a
                                new JoinDef, or edit an existing one. You can
                                also change a Join Definition's name or delete
                                it from the catalog.
