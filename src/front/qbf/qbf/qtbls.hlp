QUERY BY FORMS  -  JoinDef Definition

     This form is used to define a Join Definition (JoinDef).  A JoinDef
     is composed of tables, joins and update and delete rules.  The tables
     for a JoinDef are specified by filling in the table field on this form.

     For a Master/Master or single table Join Definition, it is unnecessary
     to fill in entries under the "Role" column, as there is no distinction
     among the roles of any tables involved.

     For a Master/Detail Join Definition the entries under the "Role" column
     specify the tables' roles in the JoinDef.  For Master tables enter
     "Master" in the "Role" column or leave that column blank.  For Detail
     tables enter "detail" (or "d").

     Case is insignificant in specifying the "Role" entry and an initial
     letter is sufficient to distinguish Master and Detail Roles.  If any
     Detail tables are specified, it is required that at least one Master
     table be given.

     Abbreviations (to be used as QUEL range variables or SQL correlation
     names) can also be specified for any or all tables, but are optional.  
     The fields on this form are:

        Field Name              Description
        ----------               -----------
        JoinDef Name            Name of the current JoinDef (optional).
        Role                    Roles of tables in this JoinDef.
        Table Name              Names of tables in this JoinDef.
        Abbreviation            Optional abbreviations for tables in this
                                this JoinDef.
        Table Field Format      Indicates whether or not a table field
                                should be used in building the default 
                                form for this JoinDef.

     The following commands are on the QBF Table Entry Form:

        Command                 Function
        --------                --------
        Go                      Build the JoinDef with the information 
                                filled in this form.  If no errors occur,
                                proceed to the QBF Query Execution Phase.
        Blank                   Clear all fields on the form so that a
                                new JoinDef can be defined.
        ChangeDisplay           Go to the Change Display Form. This allows
                                you to change the displayed fields of the 
                                current Join Definition.
        Joins                   Go to the Join Specification Form.  This
                                allows you to browse and modify the join
                                information for the current JoinDef.
        Rules                   Go to the Update and Delete Rules Form.
                                This allows you to browse and modify the 
                                rules for the current Join Definition.
        Save                    Store the current Join Definition in the 
                                QBF System Catalog.  This enables you to 
                                later retrieve and run that JoinDef.  If an 
                                invalid name is found in the "Name" field, 
                                QBF asks you to specify a valid JoinDef name.
        ListChoices             Displays a list of table names or list of
                                valid roles if the cursor is on the "Table
                                Name" or "Role" column of the table field,
                                respectively.  Otherwise, information about
                                the field the cursor is on is displayed.
        Help                    Print this message.
        End                     Stop work on this frame and return to the
                                frame that called it.
        Quit                    Leave QBF and return to the operating system.
