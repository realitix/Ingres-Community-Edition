With the UPDATE function, you can change or delete existing rows in your 
JoinDef. You can invoke the UPDATE function either by specifying the 
"-mupdate" flag in your command line or by typing the "Update" command 
in the main Query Execution phase menu.

There are two states in the UPDATE function.  The first state is the QUERY
state in which you can specify which rows you wish to retrieve to change or
delete.  Once you enter your query, QBF will display your data to edit. 
This constitutes the GO state.

You are now in the GO state of the QBF UPDATE function.  After editing the 
data on the screen, you can display the next record in your query by 
selecting the "Next" command.

Depress the MENU KEY to call the GO state menu.  From here you may write
the changes you have made by typing the "Save" command, delete the rows you 
are viewing with the "Delete" command, start a new query without writing your 
changes by typing the "Query" command or leave QBF and return to the 
operating system by typing "Quit".

As in the RETRIEVE and APPEND functions, the menu displayed in the UPDATE
function is tailored to fit the type of Join Definition you are running
and the format in which you are displaying your data.  

QBF stores all the changes you make to your data in a temporary buffer as 
you browse through and edit the data.  Those changes are not written to the
database until you select the "Save" command.

To summarize, the commands in the UPDATE Function are:

    COMMAND             FUNCTION
    -------             --------
    Next                Get the next record.
    Query               Exit the GO state and return to QUERY state.
    Delete              Delete the current record.
    Save                Write the changes stored in the buffer to INGRES.
    Help                Print this message.
    Quit                Leave QBF and return to the operating system.
