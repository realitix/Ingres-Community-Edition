Query By Forms (QBF) is an interactive, visually oriented forms interface
package for adding, deleting, changing and viewing data in your tables.

Below is a list of functions you can execute from the main menu of QBF's
Query Execution Phase.  To enter a function just type the name of the
function followed by a carriage return.  Each function has its own menu which
you may call by depressing the MENU KEY.  From these menus you can receive
help by typing the "Help" command or return to the main query execution menu
by typing the "End" command.

                        name.
