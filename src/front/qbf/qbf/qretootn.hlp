With the RETRIEVE function, you can view rows in your JoinDef without changing
them. You can invoke the RETRIEVE function either by specifying the 
"-mretrieve" flag in your command line or by typing the "Retrieve" command 
in the QBF Query Execution Phase menu.

You are in the GO state of the QBF RETRIEVE function.  Rows from a previously
entered query are being displayed for you to browse.

From the RETRIEVE Function menu you may start a new query by choosing the 
"Query" command or leave the RETRIEVE Function by selecting "End". 

To summarize, the commands for the Retrieve Function are:

    COMMAND             FUNCTION
    -------             --------
    Query               Leave the Retrieve Function and go to QUERY State
                        to enter a new query.  All fields are cleared.
    Help                Print this message.
    End                 Leave the Retrieve Function.
