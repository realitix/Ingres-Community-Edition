With the UPDATE function, you can change or delete existing rows in your
table.  You can invoke the UPDATE function either by specifying the "-mupdate"
flag in your command line or by typing the "Update" command in the main Query
Execution phase menu.

There are two states in the UPDATE function.  The first state is the QUERY
state in which you can specify which rows you wish to retrieve to change or
delete.  Once you enter your query, QBF will display your data to edit. 
This is the GO state.

You are now in the GO state.  After editing the data on the screen, you can 
display the next records in your query by selecting the "NextMaster" or 
"NxtDetail" commands.

Depress the MENU KEY to call the GO state menu. You then have several options:
You can delete the rows you are viewing by typing the "Delete" command.
(You will be asked which rows you wish to delete; you can choose to delete
just the detail, or to delete the master along with the currently displayed
detail, or to delete the master along with all associated details). 
You can add a new detail to the current master with the "AddDetail" command.
(You must overtype the currently displayed detail with the new detail
before you depress the MENU KEY and type "AddDetail"; after you type
"AddDetail", the previously displayed detail will be redisplayed).
You can write the changes you have made by typing the "Save" command.
You can also start a new query without writing your changes by typing
the "Query" command, or leave the UPDATE function by typing "Quit".

As in the RETRIEVE and APPEND functions, the menu displayed in the UPDATE
function is tailored to fit the type of Join Definition you are running
and the format in which you are displaying your data.  

QBF stores all the changes you make to your data in a temporary buffer as 
you browse through and edit the data.  Those changes are not written to the
database until you select the "Save" command.

To summarize, the commands in the UPDATE Function are:

    COMMAND             FUNCTION
    -------             --------
    NextMaster          Get the next master record and its associated
                        first detail record.
    Query               Exit the GO state and return to QUERY state.
    Delete              Display a submenu to chose what components of the
                        currently displayed records to delete.
    NxtDetail           Get the next detail record for the current master.
    AddDetail           Append a new detail record for the current master.
    Save                Write the changes stored in the buffer to INGRES.
    Help                Print this message.
    Quit                Exit QBF and return to the operating system.
