The APPEND Function of QBF adds rows to the table(s) in your Join
Definition (JoinDef).  You can invoke the APPEND function either by 
specifying the "-mappend" flag in the command line or by entering the 
"Append" command from the QBF Execution Phase menu.

Once invoked, the APPEND function displays a form on the screen corresponding
to your Join Definition (JoinDef).  Each field on the screen corresponds to 
either a column in one of the JoinDef table(s) or a join pair of the JoinDef.
To enter data simply fill in the form.  

After the form is filled in, you can add the data to your table(s) by 
selecting the "Append" command from the menu.

QBF checks your form for valid data at this point.  If there is an error,
it returns you to the invalid field.  If there are no errors, QBF will send
your data to the DBMS to be written to your table(s).  The DBMS performs
further validity, permission and integrity checks on your data before
writing the append(s).  If any errors occur at this point, INGRES prints an
appropriate error message.  Then QBF allows you to correct the errors and
run the append again.

The commands for the APPEND Function are:

    COMMAND             FUNCTION
    -------             --------
    Append              Add the data on the forms to the tables in your
                        Join Definition.
    Help                Print this message.
    Quit                Leave QBF and return to the operating system.
