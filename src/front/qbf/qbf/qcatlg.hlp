     This form displays a list of all the Join Definitions (JoinDefs)
     owned by you and by the database administrator.  To select a 
     Join Definition for an operation, position the cursor over the 
     row containing that Join Definition and select the operation 
     you wish to perform.

     Commands available in the JoinDefs Catalog are:

        Command                 Function
        -------                 --------
        Create                  Create a new JoinDef.
        Destroy                 Destroy the selected JoinDef.  This removes 
                                the join definition and its name from the 
                                database as well as the JoinDef catalog frame.
        Edit                    Edit the selected JoinDef.  This allows you 
                                to modify the JoinDef specification and 
                                retain its name in the database.
        Rename                  Rename the selected JoinDef. QBF prompts you 
                                for the new name of the JoinDef.  If you 
                                immediately depress the RETURN key, QBF 
                                returns you to the form without changing the 
                                JoinDef's name.  If you enter a correct name, 
                                QBF changes the catalog in the database and 
                                reflects that change on the Catalog form.
        Go                      Execute the selected JoinDef (i.e. run the
                                query associated with the JoinDef against
                                data in the database).
        MoreInfo                Show additional information about the selected
                                JoinDef.
        Find                    Find an entry containing the specified string.
        Top                     Move to the top of the JoinDef display.
        Bottom                  Move to the bottom of the JoinDef display.
        Help                    Print this message. 
        End                     Return to the QBF Start-Up Form.
