With the UPDATE function, you can change or delete existing rows in your 
JoinDef.  You can invoke the UPDATE function either by specifying the 
"-mupdate" flag in your command line or by typing the "Update" command 
in the main Query Execution phase menu.

There are two states in the UPDATE function.  The first state is the QUERY
state in which you can specify which rows you wish to retrieve to change or
delete.  Once you enter your query, QBF will display your data to edit. 
This is called the GO state.

You are now in the GO state.  After editing the data on the screen, you 
can display the next record in your query by selecting the "Next" command.

Depress the MENU KEY to call the GO state menu.  From here you may write
the changes you have made by choosing the "Save" command, delete the rows 
you are viewing with the "Delete" command, start a new query without 
writing your changes by selecting the "Query" command or leave the UPDATE 
function by choosing "End".

As in the RETRIEVE and APPEND functions, the menu displayed in the UPDATE
function is tailored to fit the type of Join Definition you are running
and the format in which you are displaying your data.  

QBF stores all the changes you make to your data in a temporary buffer as 
you browse through and edit the data.  Those changes are not written to the
database until you select "Save".

To summarize, the commands in the UPDATE Function are:

    COMMAND             FUNCTION
    -------             --------
    Next                Get the next record.
    Query               Exit the GO state and return to QUERY state.
    Delete              Delete the current record.
    Save                Write the changes stored in the buffer to INGRES.
    Help                Print this message.
    End                 Leave the UPDATE Function.
