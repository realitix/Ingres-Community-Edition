     This form contains the Update and Delete rules for the current
     Join Definition.  You can browse and/or modify the rules shown
     on this form.  These rules inform you of the effects updates and
     deletes will have on the tables in your database.  You may change
     these values by changing the Update? and Delete? columns in each
     of the tables on the form.  

     The Update Information table contains one row for each join field 
     in the Join Definition (JoinDef).  Each join field is specified by
     its column designation which is given in the form table.column_name,
     where "table" is the table abbreviation, if one has been given.
     Otherwise the table name itself is used.  QBF fills in all values in
     this table.  Except for "Update?", all other columns in the table are
     read only.  The fields in the Update Information table are:

     Field                      Description
     -----                      -----------
     Column                     A column designation.  A join has been
                                defined between this column and a column in
                                another table.
     Update?                    A YES/NO field that indicates whether 
                                UPDATES are enabled for this join field.
                                This field is asking the question:
                                In QBF UPDATE Mode if the value in the
                                form field attached to this join field 
                                changes, do you want the change to be 
                                reflected in your database table?

     The Delete Information table contains one row for each table in the
     Join Definition (JoinDef).  QBF fills in all values in this table. 
     Except for "Delete?", all other columns in the table are read only.
     The fields in the Delete Information Table are:

     Field                      Description
     -----                      -----------
     Role                       Indicates the role of the table described on
                                the row. Valid roles are Master and Detail.
     TableName or Abbreviation  Name (or abbreviation) of one of the table(s)
                                in the Join Definition.
     Delete?                    A YES/NO field that indicates whether
                                DELETES are enabled for this table. This
                                field is asking the question:  In QBF UPDATE
                                Mode if row(s) are deleted on the form, do you
                                want the corresponding row(s) to also be 
                                deleted in this particular table in your
                                database?

                                update and delete rules to reflect the changes
                                made on the form.
