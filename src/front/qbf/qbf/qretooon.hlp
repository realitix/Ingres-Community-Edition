With the RETRIEVE function, you can view rows in your JoinDef without changing
them. You can invoke the RETRIEVE function either by specifying the 
"-mretrieve" flag in your command line or by typing the "Retrieve" command 
in the QBF Query Execution Phase menu.

There are two states in the RETRIEVE function.  The first state is the QUERY
state in which you can specify which rows you wish to retrieve for browsing. 
Once you enter your query, QBF will display your rows on the form for you
to browse.  This constitutes the GO state.  

You are currently in the GO state of the QBF RETRIEVE function.  Records
from a previously specified query are being displayed. To display the 
next screen of data in your query select the "Next" menu command.  

From the RETRIEVE Function menu you may start a new query by selecting the 
"Query" command or leave the RETRIEVE Function by selecting "End".  You can 
also re-run or edit the last query you ran by selecting the "LastQuery" menu 
command from the QUERY state menu and then selecting the "Go" menu command.

To summarize, the commands for the Retrieve Function are:

    COMMAND             FUNCTION
    -------             --------
    Next                Get the next record.
    Query               Leave the Retrieve Function and go to QUERY State
                        to enter a new query.  All fields are cleared.
    Help                Print this message.
    End                 Leave the Retrieve Function.
