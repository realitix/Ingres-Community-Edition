Both the QBF RETRIEVE and UPDATE functions have a QUERY state.
In this state you fill in a form to specify the query you wish
to run on your current Join Definition.  Simply fill in the form 
with the values of the data you are searching for.

Valid query operators are =, !=, <, <=, >, and >=.  If no operator
is specified, QBF assumes the operator is "=".   Multiple comparisons 
within a field are possible using the logical operators "and", "or" and
parentheses.  Wildcard characters for partial pattern matching are also
supported.

To run the query you have entered, depress the MENU KEY and select
the "Go" menu command.  To display the values and query operators of
the previous query, select the "LastQuery" command.  You may edit the
form and then select "Go" to run the last query or some variant of it.

"Blank" clears all the fields on your form so you can begin
typing a new query.  

"Order" places you in a mode to set the sorting order of retrieving
data for the duration of the execution phase.

To leave QBF and return to the operating system, select the "Quit" menu 
command.

To summarize, the commands for QUERY State are:

    COMMAND             FUNCTION
    -------             --------
    Go                  Run the specified query and proceed to the
                        GO State to browse or update data.
    Blank               Clear all fields so a new query can be entered.
    LastQuery           Redisplay the values and query operators from
                        the previous query to run the last query or some
                        variant of it.
    Order               Set the sorting order of retrieving data.
