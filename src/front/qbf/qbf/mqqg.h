** Name:	MQQG_GEN	- Structure for QS_VALGEN QRY_SPEC.
**
** Description:
**	This structure is pointed to by a QS_VALGEN QRY_SPEC.
**	The structure will get passed to bldwhere by IIQG_generate
**	when it needs to build the where clause for the query.
**	bldwhere uses the MQQDEF pointed to by this structure to
**	build its query.  It also needs to know which where clause,
**	the master or the detail, is being built.
