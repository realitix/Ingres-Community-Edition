**	When connecting to the database, an internal descriptor is

**      XA application, each active XA transaction at this application server
**      (AS) also requires a number of internal structures. Either of these
**      could not be allocated due to the shortage of memory. Try one of the
**      following:
**      a) reduce the number of database connections and/or concurrent XA
**         transactions in this application program, (start more ASs)
**      b) try closing some cursors, if too many are open at the same time.
