/**
** Name:	frsctlblk.h -	Control Block Definitions for 6.0 Forms System.
**
** Description:
**	This file contains the definitions for new control block
**	structures that will be used in the 6.0 Forms System.
**	Three control blocks will be defined: 1) an overall
**	frs control block, 2) a control block for when activation/validation
**	settings and 3) information about events that the upper
**	levels of the Forms System is interested in.
**
** History:
**	12/22/86 (dkh) - Initial version.
**	05/17/88 (dkh) - Added new members to FRS_EVCB to support
**			 inquire on current field position info.
**	05/20/88 (dkh) - More fiddling with the control blocks.
**	07/23/88 (dkh) - Added exec sql immediate hook.
**	28-feb-89 (bruceb)
**		Added act_entry field to FRS_AVCB--indicate entry activation
**		is enabled.  Added entry_act to FRS_EVCB to indicate that an
**		entry activation has occured.
**	14-mar-89 (bruceb)
**		Added lastcmd structure member to the evcb.
**	24-apr-89 (bruceb)
**		Removed 'timeout' from frs_globs struct and added shell_enabled.
**	07-jul-89 (bruceb)
**		Added FRS_RFCB struct.  Contains function pointers (to
**		runtime/tbacc) used by frame code.
**	07/12/89 (dkh) - Added support for emerald internal hooks.
**	25-jul-89 (bruceb)
**		Added in_validation to FRS_GLCB structure.  Only set when
**		not in query mode (form or table field.)
**	08/01/89 (dkh/bruceb) - Added call back routine pointers for
**			 aggregate processing.
**	27-sep-89 (bruceb)
**		Changed i4  shell_enabled to i4 enabled and started use
**		of bit masks.
**	12/01/89 (dkh) - Added support for WindowView GOTOS.
**	12/27/89 (dkh) - Added call back function pointer gotochk_proc
**			 due to IIFTgcGotoChk() being moved to frame!fdmove.c.
**	01-feb-90 (bruceb)
**		Added ks_ch entry to evcb for single keystroke find capability.
**		ks_ch is bigger than the definition in kst.h (it's 4 bytes
**		instead of 3) to facilitate 4-byte alignment of the structure.
**		Added KEYFIND flag to FRS_GLCB for toggling this feature.
**	07-feb-90 (bruceb)
**		Added GETMSGS_DISP flag to FRS_GLCB for requesting that error
**		messages be displayed when getform/getrow/unloadtable are
**		called.  Default (when unset) is to supress 'user' errors.
**	13-feb-90 (bruceb)
**		Default for the above changed to NOT supress; and flag now
**		called GETMSGS_OFF to compensate.
**	10-apr-90 (bruceb)
**		Added TFXSCROLL flag to FRS_GLCB for requesting table field
**		scroll 'hotspots' at intersections of top and bottom lines
**		with the column separators.  (Default is for the entire top
**		and bottom lines to perform that duty.)
**	6-may-92 (leighb) DeskTop Porting Change:
**		Added 'dsrecords_proc' to FRS_UTPR struct.
**	09/03/92 (dkh) - Added support for controlling behavior of "Out
**			 of Data" message when scrolling a table field.
**	04/23/94 (dkh) - Added new define (UP_DOWN_EXIT) to control whether 
**			 field exit is allowed with the up/down arrows.
**			 This is for backwards compatibility so existing
**			 applications won't break.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	19-May-2009 (kschendel) b122041
**	    The only DSRecords proc (in tbacc) is void, fix here.

**  ONLY inquire on the control block.

/*
**  A control block to gather information about interesting events
**  that was triggered by user input.  Examples are tabbing to
**  the next field or pressing the menu key.
**  The upper (above FT) levels of the Forms System may set/inquire
**  on the control block.  The lower (FT and below) layers of the
**  Forms System normally only set information in the control block
**  with inquiry also permitted.
**
**  New structure members added to support inquire on current input area
**  position.  Members xcursor and ycursor provide
**  screen relative position of screen cursor.  These all start at 1.
**  Members scrxoffset and yscroffset provide scroll offset for current
**  form.  This tells us how many rows and columns the current form has
**  scrolled.  For example, if scryoffset is -30, then the form has
**  scrolled 30 rows, or 30 rows are not visible off the top of the
**  terminal screen.
**
**  To calculate where a certain field starts at relative to the screen,
**  one does the following calculations.
**  For a simple field:
**	get hdr for simple field.
**	get val for simple field.
**	get type for simple field.
**  Calculate position relative to form.
**	posx = hdr->fhposx + type->ftdatax;
**	posy = hdr->fhposy + val->fvdatay;
**  Calculate position relative to screen and go to 1 addressing.
**	posx += scrxoffset + 1;
**	posy += scryoffset + 1;
**
**  For a table field cell:
**	check to see if current row is valid.  we may be in the middle of
**	a table field scroll.  this can make the current row < 0 or >
**	number of physical rows.  if this is the case, just return 0.
**	get hdr for table field.
**	get val for cell in table field.
**	get type for cell in table field.
**  Perform same calculatins as above.
