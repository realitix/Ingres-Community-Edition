**	The following list of strings represent the responses for 'yes' and 'no'
**	in a given language and are used for checking both prompt responses and
**	values entered in fields.  Up to five values each are supported for a
**	positive or negative response.  These are case insensitive since the

**
**	Not all five choices need be specified; leave the last few the same as
**	the first (as is done in the English file) if this is the case.  Note
**	that all the prefixes that are to be allowed for a response should be
**	specified.  Also note that the first choice, F_UG0001_Yes1, is to be
**	used as the one character representation of "Yes", and the second

program will stop.  The internal routine in which the error
occurred is '%0c'.  Usually, restarting the program and trying
the operation will succeed in this case.  If that is not the

/*%
** Explanation:
**	A memory allocation or free error has occurred somewhere in

**	file that contains all the INGRES forms.  A separate file exists for
**	each ethnic language that INGRES supports.  The file for the current

**	("$II_CONFIG/$II_LANGUAGE/rtiforms.fnx",) or the pathname specified
**	through II_FORMFILE is incorrect.  This is most likely because the
**	installation is incorrect.
**
** System Status:
**	No forms will be initialized.  The program will terminate.

**	Determine that the language installation is correct, and re-install
**	if necessary.  Or, if II_FORMFILE was specified make sure that it
**	specifies a valid pathname.

E_UG000F_NoDBconnect	"Error connecting to database `%0c'."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	The program could not successfully connect to the named database
**	most likely because the database does not exist, or possibly because
**	the commands specified using the ING_SET environment logical are
**	incorrect.
**
**	Occasionally, successful database connection may be precluded by
**	other errors (e.g., GCA errors, etc.) usually evidence of some sort
**	of installation problem or hardware or system failure.
**
** System Status:
**	The program will not start up.
**
** User Action:
**	Check that the database name was specified correctly and re-enter
**	the command line.  Also, check that the commands specified using
**	the ING_SET logical are correct.
