** Name:    qg.h -	Query Generator Module Interface Definitions File.
**
** Description:
**	This file defines the interface for the query generator module.  It
**	contains the definitions of the query descriptor structure, input
**	values, and output values that are the external interface of the
**	module.  Both QBF and the ABF/OSL RTS use this module.
**
**	Note:  This file is included directly as part of "oslhdr.h".
**
** History:
**	Please put history at the bottom of this section.
**
**	Revision 6.4/03
**	5/92 (Mike S)
**	Add support for true singleton SELECTs.
**	18-sep-92 (kirke)
**	    Removed bogus trigraph from comment to silence compiler.
**      09/20/92 (emerson)
**		Changed comments to reflect the fact that QG_VERSION
**		is no longer used for qr_version in ABF's QRY structure.
**
**	Revision 6.4/02
**	3/92 (Mike S)
**	Add support for EXECUTE IMMEDIATE INTO selects.
**	4/92 (Mike S)
**	Change qs_type back to u_i1 for compatibility with existing
**	ABF-produced .c files.
**
**      Revision 6.3/03/01
**      02/20/91 (emerson)
**		Bumped QG_VERSION from 2 to 3 for bug 35798;
**		see abrtnqry.qsc for details.
**
**	Revision 6.3/03/00  89/08  wong
**	Added QI_DESCRIBE, QI_PREVIOUS and QI_ISDONE.
**
**	Revision 6.3  90/01  wong
**	Version 2:  Query ID changed to be long.  JupBug #7899.
**
**	Revision 6.1  88/08  wong
**	Added QS_VALGNSV.
**
**	Revision 6.0  87/04  wong
**	Support for SQL and ADTs and also increase performance as version 1.
**
**	Revision 3.0  84/02  joe
**	Initial revision.
**
**	10/07/92 (dkh) - Removed QI_PREVIOUS and QI_ISDONE as no FE code
**			 references them.  Note that removal was prompted
**			 by alpha cross compiler which indicated that
**			 the values assigned to the constants were not
**			 legal octal values.  Any new constants that
**			 are added should avoid this problem.
**	12/93 (Mike S)
**			Add structure for stream management routines.
**	1/17/94 (davel)
**			Added define for a new error msg (QE_NOSUPP)

** Name:    QRY_SPEC -	Query Specification Entry.
**
** Description:
**	This structure defines an element of a query specification list.  A
**	query specification is a list of text, dynamic values, data values,
**	and query specification generators that together specify a query or
**	part of a query.
**
**	The query generate module sends a query specification to the DBMS
**	to define a query using the LIBQ interface.  Each element of the
**	query specification is a reference to one of the following:
**
**	    A text string that contains part of the text for a query, and is
**	    sent directly to the DBMS.  ("QS_TEXT".)
**
**	    A dynamic value that contains part of the text for a query as a
**	    string value, which was dynamically set, and is sent as a string
**	    value to the DBMS.  ("QS_QRYVAL" or "QS_QRYVAL|QS_BASE".)
**
**	    A data value that contains a data value for the query, and is sent
**	    directly to the DBMS (as a DB_DATA_VALUE.)  ("QS_VALUE" or
**	    "QS_VALUE|QS_BASE".)
**
**	    A query specification generator (QSGEN) that specifies a function
**	    and data from which a part of a query specification will be
**	    generated and sent to the DBMS.  ("QS_VALGEN" or "QS_VALGNSV".)
**	    (The generated query specifications will be saved and sent each
**	    time the query is subsequently run if the query is a child query
**	    and the specification type is QS_VALGEN.)
**
**	A query specification list is terminated by an element with type
**	"QS_END" (defined below.)
**
** History:
**	02/87 (jhw) -- Designed.
**	05/87 (jhw) -- Added QSGEN variant.
**	08/88 (jhw) -- Added QS_VALGNSV.
**	21-mar-94 (davel)
**		Added new QS_xxx constants for new DBI-specific query spec 
**		types.  Non-DBI products should always ignore query specs
**		of these types.

** Name:    QSGEN -	Query Specification Generator Element.
**
** Description:
**	Query specification structure referenced by the 'qs_var' field of a
**	QRYSPEC that is of type QS_VALGEN or QS_VALGNSV.  This structure
**	contains information needed to call a generator of QRYSPECs.
**
**	The field 'qsg_gen' points to a function that is a generator of
**	QRYSPECs.  When the generator function is called with the data
**	pointed to by 'qsg_value', it will generate QRYSPECs.  The data
**	referenced by 'qsg_value' is specific to the particular generator
**	function and its purpose is to give the generator function the
**	information needed to generate the query specifications.
**
**	N.B.: THIS FUNCTION CANNOT RETURN A QRY_SPEC OF TYPE QS_VALGEN
**	OR QS_VALGNSV!
**
**	The function pointed to by 'qsg_gen' should be a function that
**	is declared like this example generator function 'genfunc()'.
**
**	Inputs:
**		genstruct	{PTR}  This is the generator specific data that
**				was given in the 'qsg_value' field.  (Note that
**				the function must cast this internally to the
**				correct type.)
**
**		qgvalue		{PTR}  This is a reference to a value that must
**				be passed to the next routine.
**
**		qgfunc		{STATUS (*)()}  This is a function that must
**				be called once for each QRYSPEC the generator
**				function produces.  The function needs to be
**				called as:
**
**					(*qgfunc)(qgvalue, qryspec)
**
**				where 'qryspec' is the QRYSPEC being generated.
**				If '(*qgfunc)()' returns anything other than OK
**				(except for QG_NOSPEC,) the generation process
**				should be stopped and the value returned.
**
**	Returns:
**		{STATUS}	OK is everything went fine.
**				QG_NOSPEC   if no QRYSPEC was generated.
**				any other value means there was a problem.
**		
**	Declaration:
**		STATUS
**		genfunc ( genstruct, qgfunc, qgvalue )
**		PTR	genstruct
**		STATUS	(*qgfunc)();
**		PTR	qgvalue;
**
**	An example of how this might be used is the implementation of the 4GL
**	qualification function.  The qualification 
**
**		qualification (R.x = x, R.y = y)
**
**	would have a single QRYSPEC in the query specification that is of type
**	QS_VALGEN.  The QSGEN would point to a function in the ABF RunTime
**	System.  The 'qsg_value' would point to a data structure that contains:
**
**		the form name,
**		the list
**			R.x, x
**			R.y, y
**
**	With this data, the function in ABFRTS would look through the
**	form and generate QRYSPECs for the fields x and y if they contain
**	a query operator/value.

** Name:    QRY_ARGV -	Query Retrieved Value Descriptor.
**
** Description:
**	This structure defines a descriptor for a value that may be retrieved
**	by a query.  It specifies the DB_DATA_VALUE for the value and the name
**	of the field or table field column for which the data value should be
**	retrieved.
**
**	A list of descriptors describes the column values that may be retrieved
**	by a query.  This list is terminated with a descriptor that has a NULL
**	reference to a DB_DATA_VALUE.
**
**	As of version 6.0, the name is unused.  The descriptors and columns
**	retrieved from the DBMS must be in one-to-one correspondence in the
**	order returned by the DBMS, or a LIBQ run-time error will be reported.
**
**	For some future release or version, this restriction on one-to-one
**	correspondence will be relaxed.  The name will be used to determine the
**	retrieved column that corresponds to a particular descriptor allowing
**	extraneous columns to be ignored.  Note also that (named) descriptors
**	that do not correspond to any of the retrieved columns will not have
**	their values changed.  This will mean that actual values retrieved will
**	be an intersection of the descriptors with the columns retrieved by the
**	DBMS for the query.

** Name:    QDESC -		Query Generator Query Description.
**
** Description:
**	This structure contains information that describes a query.  It
**	specifies for which DML the query was stated and the mode in which
**	it is to be executed, and contains a list of descriptors for the values
**	retrieved and query specifications for the various parts of the query,
**	which can be NULL, with an optional base if the DB data values are to
**	be referenced by offset instead of directly.  (The query could have
**	been a single query specification but was not for possible debugging
**	convienence.)  It also contains a reference to a child query if this
**	query describes a master-detail query.  Finally, it contains a reference
**	to query generator internal structures used when the query is active.
**
**	Queries can be run in one of three modes:  normal, cursor or mapped.
**	Normal mode is as a retrieve/select loop.  Cursor mode is as a cursor.
**	And, mapped mode retrieves the data into a file out of which tuples
**	are retrieved.  Additionally, any of these modes can have the query
**	be a repeated query.
**
**	Note that the mode of any detail query is independent of the mode
**	of the parent.  Both must be specified, but may be different.
