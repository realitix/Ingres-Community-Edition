** Explanation:
**	The attempt to connect to a DBMS failed.  Prior to this error
**	message there should have been another error message displayed.
**	This message is only displayed if the failure was not due to

E_LQ0002_USTARTUP:SS08001_CANT_GET_CONNECTION	
"Failure to connect to DBMS.  Operating system error %0c."

/*
** Explanation:
**	Under certain circumstances the failure to connect to a DBMS is due
**	to operation system reasons.  For example lack of process resources

/*
** Explanation:
**	When retrieving data from the database, the data being assigned into

Null data from column %0c can not be converted."

/*
** Explanation:
**	When retrieving data from the database, the NULL data could not be

**
** System Status:
**	The connection will not be established.
**
** User Action:
**	In order for this error to occur, the application would have to have
**	exceeded 2^32 sessions.   This error is more likely the result
**	of an internal coding error.   Please report this problem to your

E_LQ0010_EMBNULLIN:SS22023_INV_PARAM_VAL	
"Null address of program variable in input statement.\n

E_LQ0012_DBTOOLONG:SS22005_ASSIGNMENT_ERROR	
"Length of result data (%0c) is too long for processing.\n
Data cannot be retrieved from column %1c into variable."

/*
** Explanation:
**	When retrieving data from the database, the data could not be
**	assigned into your result variable as the internal data was too
**	long for processing.  If the data to be retrieved is longer than
**	your result variable, then the communications interface uses a

"Invalid type or length describing program data.\n
Unable to convert into internal format."

/*
** Explanation:
**	When setting data in the database from a program variable, the

"Conversion failure from program data into internal format."

E_LQ0020_PARMMAX:SS21000_CARD_VIOLATION    
"Too many result columns (%0c) in PARAM target list.\n
