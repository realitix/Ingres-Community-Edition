/*
**  New front end constant that defines the maximum name
**  length of front end objects (e.g., form/field names).
**  This is needed since front end object names may
**  need to be bigger on certain environments (such as DG).
**  That's why FE_MAXNAME, instead of DB_MAXNAME, should be used. (dkh)

/*
**  Maximum number of characters which will be returned in an FRS prompt
**  response, no matter how wide the screen is.  In practice, this is wider
**  than any screens we know of thus far.  Useful in allocating response
**  buffers.  Does not count the terminating EOS.
