+*  Name: iisqlca.h - Runtime defs for SQLCA handling in an embedded program.
**
**  Description:
**	This file contains our internal typedef definition of the SQLCA as
**	well as some constants and a macro used by LIBQ in assigning status
**	information to the SQLCA.  
**
**  Defines:
**	IISQLCA
**
**  Notes:
**	When LIBQ references the SQLCA, it relies on the typedef contained in
**	this file and a pointer passed in from the user program.  When an 
**	embedded program declares the use of the SQLCA, the preprocessor 
**	generates an external (or common) declaration of the SQLCA based on 
**	the SQLCA definition contained in the file 'eqsqlca.{h|def}'.  
**	Obviously, the layout of data in both definitions is identical.

/*
** Name: SQLCA - SQL Communications Area
** 
** Description:
**	The SQLCA structure is the status area in which SQL errors,
**	warnings and return codes are stored.  The global definition
**	of this is in a library called iisqlca, with which all embedded
**	programs must link.  It is global so that no matter what
**	language or module the program is currently in, the structure
**	being passed to the SQL run-time system is the same.
**
**	This structure contains the status information that is returned
**	to the embedded program after each executable SQL statement.  The
**	SQLCA is updated during the execution of every database-related
**	SQL statement.  By inspecting the SQLCA the program can take
**	appropriate action in response to errors or exceptional conditions
**	that occurred in the most recently executed SQL statement.
**	The original definition of this structure (for PL/I) is described
**	in the DB2 programming guide.
**
**	The SQLCA is passed to LIBQ before the execution of each query.
**	Internally, LIBQ will update the different fields through the different
**	phases of the query.  It is up to LIBQ to map the internal errors,
**	status bits, and data results to the different fileds in the SQLCA.
**
**  History:
**	28-apr-1987	- written (bjb)
**	11-may-1988	- added definition of SQL messages (ncg)
**	06-dec-1989	- added definition of SQL events. (bjb)
**	23-feb-1993 - added tags to structure for making correct prototypes (mohan).
**	11-mar-93 (fraser)
**	    Changed structure tag name--shouldn't begin with underscore.
