S_AF0000_OBJECT  "Object"
/*
** Used in the E_AF2000_NO_CONVERSION message.  This should not be

S_AF0001_MISSING "<Missing>"
/*
** Used in the E_AF2000_NO_CONVERSION message to denote that the type

E_AF0007_DT_IS_FIXLEN
"Warning:  Length specified for fixed length datatype.\n A fixed length
datatype, %0c, was given a length specification that will override the
fixed length."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	A fixed length datatype, such as "smallint", was given a length
**	specification.  Since this length is either the same as the fixed
**	length or is a valid length for the base type of the datatype, it
**	will be accepted instead.
**
** System Status:
**	The given length, which may be the same as the fixed length, will
**	override the fixed length for the datatype.
**
** User Action:
**	Do not specify lengths with fixed length datatypes, if you want
**	a different length use the appropriate datatype as documented in
**	the INGRES QUEL and SQL Language Reference manuals.
*/

E_AF0008_DT_IS_VARLEN
"Warning:  No length specified for variable length datatype.\n A variable length
datatype, %0c, was not given a required length specification; a default length
of one (1) will be used."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	A variable length datatype, such as "varchar", was not given a length
**	specification.  Since a length is required in this case, a default one
**	will be used instead.
**
** System Status:
**	The length will be defaulted to one (1).
**
** User Action:
**	Always specify lengths for variable length datatypes as documented
**	in the INGRES QUEL and SQL Language Reference manuals.
*/

E_AF2000_BadDMLStr	"Unknown query language `%0c'.\n
The specified query language is not recognized.  Valid query languages are
QUEL or SQL."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	A name was specified for a query language that was not recognized.
**	Query languages must be named exactly.
**
** System Status:
**	The program may allow you to respecify the correct query language, or
**	it may default to one of the query languages.
**
** User Action:
**	Respecify the query language correctly.  The only recognized query
**	languages are QUEL or SQL.
*/

E_AF2001_NO_CONVERSION  "%0c can not be converted to %1c."

/*%
** Parameters:
**	0	The type of the value that was to be assigned
**		to some variable or field.
**
**	1	The type of the variable or field.
**
** Explanation:
**	The two types given are imcompatible and can't be assigned.
**
** System Status:
**	This error is generated by a low level routine.  The status
**	of the system will depend on the higher level routine.
**
** User Action:
**	Coerce the value to a legal type for the object being assigned.
