+*  Name: iisqlda.h - Runtime defs for SQLDA handling in an embedded program.
**
**  Description:
**	This file contains our internal typedef definition of the SQLDA.
**
**  Defines:
**	IISQLDA
**	IISQLHDLR
**
**  Notes:
**	When LIBQ references the SQLDA, it relies on the typedef contained in
**	this file and a pointer passed in from the user program.  When an 
**	embedded program declares the use of the SQLDA, the preprocessor 
**	generates an include of a file 'eqsqlda.{h|def}' which contains
**	a similar typedef.  Obviously, the layout of data in both files is 
**	identical.

/*
** Name: SQLDA - SQL Dynamic Area
** 
** Description:
**	The SQLDA structure is the structure that is filled and used to 
**	execute some of the dynamic SQL statements.  The user can define
**	this structure themselves or include it via the embedded INCLUDE
**	SQLDA command.
**	This structure contains the information to describe and process
**	dynamic queries.  The structure is used in three situations:
**	1. Data types are described into it.  This could be via the
**	   DESCRIBE statement, or via explicit filling of data types
**	   (and variable addresses) by the user.
**	2. The structure (once filled with variable addresses) can be
**	   used for input, as in the OPEN cursor_name USING statement.
**	   In this case the routine that is passed the SQLDA will call
**	   the appropriate input routine for all described variables.
**	3. The structure (once filled with variable addresses) can be
**	   used for output, as in the FETCH cursor_name USING statement.
**	   In this case the routine that is passed the SQLDA will call
**	   the appropriate output routine for all described variables.
**      The original definition of this structure (for PL/I) is documented
**      in the DB2 programming guide.
**
**	Note that variable addresses may include addresses of IISQLHDLR 
**	structures as described below.  When an SQLVAR has datatype of 
**	DB_HDLR_TYPE then sqldata will be expected to contain a pointer to an 
**	IISQLHDLR structure which contains a user-defined datahandler and 
**	optional argument.  The user-defined datahandler will be responsible 
**	for transmitting a data value to/from the database.
**
**  History:
**	05-may-1987	- written (bjb)
**	02-feb-1987	- increased length of sqlnamec to 34 (ncg)
**      17-Nov-2003 (hanal04) Bug 111309 INGEMB113
**          Changed sqllen to unsigned to prevent overflow when
**          using NVARCHARs.

** Name: IISQLHDLR - Sql DATAHANDLER Structure.
**
** Description:
**      The IISQLHDLR may be used to specify a user-defined datahandler for
**	transmitting data to/from the database. 
**
**	When an application sets the SQLTYPE field of an SQLVAR structure to
**	IISQ_HDLR_TYPE (internally DB_HDLR_TYPE) then the sqldata field is
**	expected to contain a pointer to an IISQLHDLR structure. The function
**	contained in the sqlhdlr field will be invoked with the optional 
**	argument contained in the sqlarg field.
**
**	This structure is provided in the EQSQLDA files of all host languages
**	except for MFcobol which does not support datahandlers.
**
** History:
**	19-oct-1992  (kathryn)
**		written.
