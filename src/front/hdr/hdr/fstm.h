**                       Row Control Block
**
**	History:
**	14-aug-89 (sylviap)
**		Changed mffsmore_proc() to be a bool function.
**		Added PRTKEY (print key).
** 	16-dec-91 (pearl)
**		Fix for bug 40202.  Add field to BCB structure to indicate
**		whether to print time string or not.  At present, checked
**		in _GetFile().  Report Writer shouldn't print time stamp
**		across the top of a report that the user has chosen to
**		put in a file.
**	30-oct-92 (leighb) DeskTop Porting Change:
**		Increased MSDOS defined BB_SIZE to almost 64KB.
**	5-feb-93 (rogerl) add onpopup - TRUE if input-popup is being displayed.
**		caller needs to know in case of popup interrupt.
**	8-mar-93 (rogerl) delete onpopup.
**      10-sep-93 (dkhor)
**              On axp_osf, pointers are 8 bytes long.  The hardcoded
**              RCBLEN is disastrous, need to bump up RCBLEN or else
**              isql/iquel and reportwriter will fail in
**              front/utils/uf/ufbrowse.qsc.
**  6-oct-1999 (rodjo04) bug 98949 INGCBT239
**       Doubled defined BB_SIZE. 
**	20-mar-2000 (kitch01)
**		Bug 99136. Created BFPOS structure to hold an index record for
**		the spill file. Amended BCB to hold index records for the spill
**		file so that we can correctly use the spill file.
**      20-jun-2001 (bespi01)
**              In order to track the length of lines in the spill file, a 
**              length field was added to the bfpos record.
**              Bug 104175, Problem INGCBT 335
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	07-mar-2001 (somsa01)
**	    Changed type of recpos in BFPOS structure to OFFSET_TYPE.
**      08-mar-2002 (horda03)
**              Improve performacne of ISQL when large outputs generated.
**              Use as much memory as we can. Now allow as many Browse
**              Buffers (BBLIST) as the process memory allows. To ensure
**              that we have memory available for use if we exhaust memory
**              will creating hte "complete" browse buffer list, reserve a
**              memory buffer, which wil be released to allow creation of
**              file I/O stream. The amount of memory required for the
**              file I/O stream is dependant on the size of the records
**              written to disk (i.e RACC_BLKSIZE).
**              Bug 107271.
**	28-Mar-2005 (lakvi01)
**	    Prevented multiple inclusion of fstm.h.
**	24-Aug-2009 (kschendel) 121804
**	    Add some function prototypes for gcc 4.3.
