Create Form

     This form is used when creating a new object with Short and Long Remarks.
     This form has the same appearance as the Catalog Details form and Catalog
     Save form, although the command menu is slightly different.  The Name
     field on this form should be specified, which will be the name of the new
     object.

     If an object of the same type, with the specified name, owned by
     either the current user or the DBA, already exists in the database,
     you will be asked to confirm your intention to save before proceeding.
