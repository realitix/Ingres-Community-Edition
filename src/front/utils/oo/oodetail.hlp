This form provides additional information about a selected object.
The entire form is display-only, except possibly for the Short and Long 
Remarks fields; if you are authorized to edit this object, they may be 
updated. A "Save" command is provided on the menu to store any updated 
information in the database.  "Next" ("Previous") will show the Details 
frame for the object which appears after (before) the current object in 
the catalog table field.  "Next" will advance to the top object of the 
catalog table field if the current object is the last one, and similarly 
for "Previous".
