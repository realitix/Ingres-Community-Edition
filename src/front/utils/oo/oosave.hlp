Save Form

     This form is used to save a new object or to edit Name, Short or
     Long Remarks for an existing object.  This form has the same appearance
     as the Catalog Details form, although the command menu is slightly
     different.  The Name field on this form may be modified, which will
     cause the current object, when saved, to be saved as a new object of
     the given name.  However, the Name field is read-only if saving a
     form via ABF or VISION.

     If an object of the same type, with the specified name, owned by
     either the current user or the DBA, already exists in the database,
     you will be asked to confirm your intention to save before proceeding.

        Short Remark            One-line description of current object.
        Long Remark             Longer description of current object.

                                in the "Name" field.  After a successful
                                save, this frame is exited.
        Cancel                  Cancel the current save and any changes made
                                on this form and return to the previous
                                frame.
