/**
** Name:	eroo.msg -	Object Manager Message Definitions File.
**
** Description:
**	Contains the definitions for the messages and error messages
**	output by the object manager module.
**
** History:
**	Revision 6.0  87/07/27  peterk
**	Initial revision.
**
**	Revision 6.2  89/01  wong
**	Added F_OO0001_DBA, F_OO00002_Unspecified, S_OO0029 and moved
**	S_OO0025 to "uf!eruf.msg".
**	89/11/10  terryr  Added E_OO0044.
**
**	Revision 6.3  90/03  wong
**	Changed message S_OO0029 to F_OO0004 for performance.
**	Editted S_OO002E_ExistsInDatabase for grammar.  JupBug #20946.
**	90/04  wong  Added class names.
**
**	Revision 6.3  91/03  steveh
**	Changed message E_OO0005_Not_a_legal_name.
**	This helps fix bug 36363: RBF and VIFRED are inconsistent in their
**	handling of Rename.  The change to the message involved reversing
**	the order of the arguments so that IIUGerr correctly displays the
**	name of the renamed object when the length of the name is excessively
**	long.
**
**	2-jun-93 (blaise)
**		Added E_OO0051_OLD_VERSION, for all those thousands of users
**		who are attempting to edit pre-6.0 vigraph objects - from 6.5
**		we no longer attempt to convert these.

** Explanation:
**	The user is trying to edit a pre-6.0 encoded vigraph object. From
**	6.5, we no longer attempt to convert old objects to 6.0 format.
** System Status:
**	The program will continue, but the user will not be able to edit 
**	the selected object.
** User Action:
**	Running an earlier version of Vigraph (6.0-6.4) will convert the
**	object to 6.0 format.
