You have selected to send the query results to a file.  Please enter
a valid file name.  You may also specify a full directory pathname
with your file name.

You have the option of sending all the results to a file (OK) or sending 
just the results that have been viewed (FilePartial).  For large queries, 
unless you have viewed the last screen, you will get only partial results 
of the query.  For small queries, partial results may end up being the 
complete dataset.

The field on the popup is:

	FIELD           DESCRIPTION
	-----		-----------
	File Name	Name of the file to contain the query output.


The menu commands are as follows:
