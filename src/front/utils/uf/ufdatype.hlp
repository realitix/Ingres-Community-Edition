You need to select a data type from the displayed list of legal data types.
Position the cursor on the row that describes the data type that you wish to
specify and select it.  You will then be prompted for a length specification
(or precision and scale) if applicable.  Except for the character types,
lengths are either not applicable or will be defaulted if you select a data
type without specifying a length.
