/*{
** Name:	IIUFrtmRestoreTerminalMode  - restore the terminals mode.
**
** Description:
**	TO USE THIS ROUTINE YOU MUST INCLUDE uf.h.
**	
**	This routine is used to change the terminal's mode from FORMS
**	to NORMAL and back again.  It is called by programs like ABF
**	and MENU which run in forms mode, but sometimes call other subsystems
**	that must run in non FORMS mode.  This routine can be called
**	by a program that is not in forms mode.  In those cases, it
**	is a noop.  This feature is useful for ABF where part of its
**	library is called by the ABFIMAGE routine which runs non-forms.
**
**	Depending on the value of mode, the program's terminal mode will
**	be changed.  If mode is:
**
**		IIUFNORMAL		Sets the terminal's mode to that
**					of a normal program.
**
**		IIUFFORMS		Sets the terminal's mode to that of
**					of a forms program.  This will clear
**					the screen when making the change.
**
**		IIUFPROMPT		Sets the terminal's mode to that of
**					a forms program.  However, before
**					clearing the screen it prompts the
**					user so that any message left on
**					the screen by the previously executed
**					program can be viewed by the user before
**					being erased.
**
**		IIUFMORE		This is like IIUFPROMPT, but it should
**					be used after a call to a program that
**					the CMS people would like to display
**					a prompt for.  Admittedly, this mode
**					is a strange one, but is needed since in
**					some cases, CMS will prompt before
**					clearing whereas the non-CMS version
**					won't.  To change either to work like
**					the other would cause distress for
**					the user.
**
**	NOTE that this routine does care how you change the mode of
**	the terminal.  It is perfectly okay to set the mode to
**	FORMS and then set it to FORMS again.
**
** Input:
**	mode	{nat}  The mode to change the terminal to.  One of:
**			IIUFNORMAL
**			IIUFFORMS
**			IIUFPROMPT
**			IIUFMORE

**		First Written.
**	11/02/90 (dkh) - Fixed bug 34251.  Put in special calls
**			 to make sure prompting for user input
**			 does not cause spurious screen redraws.
**	11/02/90 (dkh) - Replaced IILIBQgdata with IILQgdata().
