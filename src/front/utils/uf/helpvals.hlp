This display gives you information about the values allowed in the field
upon which your cursor was positioned when you asked for Help.  The table
lists information about the validations in effect for that field (if any.)

The name of the field is shown at the top of the screen, followed by one
of the following kinds of information in the table:

    -  The datatype for the field, indicating whether you should
       enter 'Integer' (whole numbers), 'Floating Point' (numbers
       with optional decimal parts) or 'Character' (any mix of
       characters and digits).  This is followed by a listing of
       the validation rules in effect for that field, if any.  Refer
       to the Character-based Querying and Reporting Tools User Guide
       for a description of the rules.

    -  If a single list of valid values is allowed for the field, the
       list is displayed for you in the table.  You may scroll through
       the list, using the displayed menu commands, or any other
       scrolling commands.  You can use the "Select" menuitem to choose
       the item upon which your cursor is placed, transferring it to
       the field where you originated the request for help.

The menu commands are:

        MENU COMMAND         SYNOPSIS

                             upon directly to the field where you originated
                             the help request.  (Only available if a list 
                             is in effect.)
