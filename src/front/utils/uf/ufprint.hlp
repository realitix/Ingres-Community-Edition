You have selected to send the query results to a printer.  Please specify 
the printer, the number of copies to be printed and the file name to contain 
the results.

The output will first be sent to the specified file and then sent to the 
printer.  The file will be sent to the system default printer if 'default' 
is entered as the printer name.  You may override the default printer by
specifying another printer name.  The maximum number of copies allowed 
is 999.  You may also specify a full directory pathname with your file name.
After printing the results, this file will be deleted.  

You have the option of printing all the results (OK) or printing just the 
results that have been viewed (PrintPartial).  For large queries, unless
you have viewed the last screen, you will get only partial results of the
query.  For small queries, partial results may end up being the complete
dataset.

The fields on the popup are:
 
	FIELD           DESCRIPTION
	-----           -----------
	Printer     	Name of the printer to send the output results.
			  
	Copies          Number of copies of the output results to be printed.

	File Name	Name of the file to contain the output results.


The menu commands are as follows:


      MENU COMMANDS	SYNOPSIS
      -------------	--------

			the query before sending the results to the printer.

      Cancel		Return back to the Output Browser without printing
