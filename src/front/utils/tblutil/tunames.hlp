INGRES Naming Rules
-------------------
Valid table and column names begin with a letter or underscore.  This can
be followed by letters, digits, the underscore, or one of the special
characters '@', '#' or '$'.   Spaces are not allowed.  Names beginning
with "ii" are reserved for INGRES system use. These rules can be avoided
by using delimited id's for your table and/or column names.

*Open SQL Naming Rules
----------------------
Valid table and column names begin with a letter. This can be followed by
letters, digits, and the underscore. Spaces are not allowed.  Names beginning
with "ii" are reserved for INGRES system use.

* Open SQL is a subset of INGRES SQL that is supported by all gateways to
  non-INGRES databases.

/#-- Add note about FIPS naming conventions and delimited identifiers.

Column names should be entered in the table in the same order you wish
them to be presented to you from the database.  The first row describes
the leftmost column of your table.
