You have elected to run the report writer on the selected table.
On this menu, you should select the basic style of the default
report to be created.

The three styles are:

        Tabular         Produce a report which shows the name of each
                        column in the table as a heading, and under
                        each heading, lists the data for the column in
                        columnar format. This will produce a report as wide
                        as necessary to fit all columns in the table.

        Wrap            Produce a Tabular report, but wrap the column
                        headings and data at the screen width.

                        together in pairs. Useful for reports
