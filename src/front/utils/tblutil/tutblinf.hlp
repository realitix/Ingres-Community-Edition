This screen lists information about a table, view, synonym or index in the
database.

Information about the table, view, synonym or index (these four will be
referred to below as simply "table"), for example its name and owner, is
displayed at the top of the screen.

The table field lists the columns within the table, along with their
data type, whether they participate in the primary key of the table,
and whether Nulls and/or default values are allowed for the column.
If there are more columns in the table than show in the table
field, you can view them by using the table field scrolling keys or
cursor control keys.
