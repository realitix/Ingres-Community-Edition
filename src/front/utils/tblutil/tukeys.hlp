Your table will be created as a btree structure, with the keys you specified
in the "Key" column of the table field.  Your table will be keyed either
unique or not-unique, according to your selection on this form.

To make a selection, place the cursor on the row of your choice and select
the menu command "Select".  Select the row labeled "Unique" if you want your
table to have unique keys.  If you do not want unique keys, then select
the row labeled "Not unique".  Select the menu command "Cancel" if you
want to return to the "Create a Table" screen without creating a table.

Creating a table with unique keys has the effect of requiring each key value
in the table to be unique.  (A key value is the concatenation of all key
columns in a row.)  Ingres will not allow the insertion of two rows with
the same key value in a table with unique keys.  If your table is created
without unique keys, then keyed access is still possible, but Ingres will
allow you to insert multiple rows with the same key value.

Unique keys are recommended when possible to improve performance and
data integrity.
