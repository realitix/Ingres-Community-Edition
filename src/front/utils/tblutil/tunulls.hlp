You can elect to have a column participate in the primary key for the
table by placing the sequence number of the column within the key in
the column marked Key #.  This makes access to the data in the table,
when qualified on the values of the keys, much more efficient.  The
sequence numbers should start at 1 for the first column within the
key, 2 for the second, and so forth.  A storage structure of
Btree will be used to index the table.

Some INGRES gateways do not use the Key # column.  In addition, INGRES
gateways do not create a Btree index.

By placing a value of 'y' in the column marked "Nulls," you can elect to
allow null values in the data for the column.  No null values will be
allowed if this is set to 'n'.

If null values are NOT allowed, you may elect to have default values(**) for
the column by placing a 'y' in the column marked Defaults.  This means that
a 0 or blank value will be placed in the column if it is not specified when
inserting data into the table.  If the Defaults column is set to 'n' an error
will occur if an attempt is made to insert data without specifying a value
for the column. The Defaults column can be set to 'null' if the "Nulls"
column has value 'y'(es). This means a null is inserted if no value is
specified for this column. It can be set to 'user' if the datatype is one
of the character datatypes and is of length 32 or greater to indicate that
the default value for this column should be the current (at insert time)
user's user id. Defaults can be set to 'value' to indicate a default value
of your own specification. You will be prompted to specify that value, or
you can select the "EditDefaults" menuitem to specify one.

** Default values are not supported by Open SQL.
