**
** Description:
**	This file defines the messages for class TU.
**
** History:
**	10-aug-1987 (daver)
**		Created.
**	22-oct-1987 (peter)
**		Take out many of the FEmsg calls.
**	23-oct-1990 (mgw)
**		Corrected some misspellings. Both are in comments, not messages,
**		but these comments get picked up for the messages.txt file via
**		erxtract and are thus in a deliverable.
**	11/07/90 (emerson)
**		Added messages E_TU002F and E_TU0030 (bug 33846).
**	18-jun-1992 (mgw)
**		Added new strings F_TU006E_Synonym, F_TU000A_Base_Table,
**		F_TU0016_Base_Table_Owner and F_TU0046_Destroying_synonym and
**		changed F_TU006D_HelpSubject to support synonyms in 6.5
**	17-sep-1992 (mgw)
**		Added TU0009_Decimal.
**      12-jan-1993 (rogerl)
**              Correct E_TU0027_Illegal_column_name control so argument is
**              printed.
**	22-jan-1993 (mgw)
**		Added E_TU000E_Own_dot_Tab_notexist for clarity. Same as
**		E_TU0016_Table_doesnt_exist, but says table not owned by '%0c'
**		instead of table not owned by you.
**	16-apr-1993 (rogerl)
**		Add E_TU0010_Must_be_on_table_fiel (50751).
**	21-apr-1993 (rogerl)
**		Add E_TU000E_NotNull_NullDefault, to enable inclusion of row
**		number in error message (there may be multiple, consecutive
**		issuances of this message)
**	23-apr-1993 (rogerl)
**		Change wording & number of E_TU000A_QUEL_Defaults.  It was
**		never released and it is has been superseded, so use it for
**		a similar (but separate) purpose. (now E_TU000A_NA_Defaults)
**	21-may-1993 (rogerl)
**		Add E_TU0012_NADataType to display at BLOB column creat attempt
**	2-aug-1993 (rogerl)
**		Lower case datatype names (53015)
**	27-aug-1993 (mgw) Bug #54557
**		Added error message E_TU000F_Bad_Defaultability for when
**		user enters an illegal defaultability in the Defaults column.
**	20-sep-1993 (mgw)
**		Added new datatypes BYTE, BYTE VARYING, LONG BYTE, and
**		LONG VARCHAR.
**	17-mar-94 (lan)
**		Fixed bug #58066 - Replaced 'INGRES Technical Support'
**		with 'Site Technical Contact'.
**	2-Dec-07 (kibro01) b119562
**		Added extra messages to handle scaling of values in "tables"
