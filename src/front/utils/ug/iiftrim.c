/*{
** Name:	IIftrim		-	Trim a forms system character field
**
** Description:
**	The forms system always has trimmed trailing blanks
**	from character-type field values that are being returned to callers.
**	This is a unique forms system characteristic - an EQUEL program 
**	that retrieves a character-type value from the database will NOT
**	have it's trailing blanks trimmed.  Therefore, this routine
**	is called from all RUNTIME and TBACC routines that return FRS field
**	values to callers, to 'trim' trailing blanks.
**
**	Provided with an input and output DB_DATA_VALUE, the ouput
**	DB_DATA_VALUE will contain the trimmed data value for the
**	field.  As a side effect, if the input DBV was nullable, and
**	the actual value in it was not NULL, the output DBV will have
**	been converted to a non-nullable type, so CALLER BEWARE.
**
**	Method:  The input DB_DATA_VALUE is copied into the output one (NOTE
**	the DB_DATA_VALUE itself is copied, not the data it points to).
**	If the value is not NULL afe_dtrimlen is called to trim the value.
**	This is a change from the previous method is order to handle
**	double byte characters correctly.
**
** Inputs:
**	indbv		Ptr to a DB_DATA_VALUE to check, and perhaps, to trim.
**	outdbv		Ptr to a DB_DATA_VALUE to update with the trimmed
**				value.
**
** Outputs:
**	outdbv		Will be updated with a copy of the input DBV, trimmed
**				if necessary, and possibly made non-nullable.
**
** Returns:
**	STATUS		OK
**			FAIL	
**
** Exceptions:
**	none
**
** Side Effects:
**	If the dbv passed in was a nullable but pointed to a non-null value, 
**	then the dbv copy returned will be non-nullable.
**
** History:
**	01-apr-1987	Created (drh).
**	21-apr-1987	Modified input parameters to accept an output
**			DB_DATA_VALUE.

/*{
** Name:	IIUGfnFeName - Create a valid FE Name given a string.
**
** Description:
**	This routine will scan through a string pulling out characters
**	that are valid for use as a valid FE name.  The resultant name
**	will be lower cased as well.  This routine will stop after pulling
**	out 32 bytes of characters.  Note that it is up to the caller to
**	check for an empty result string as well as providing an output
**	buffer that is big enough.
**
**	The rules for a FE name are:
**	- mono case (essentially lower case)
**	- up to 32 bytes in length.
**	- must start with an alpha or underscore character
**	- other valid characters are digits (0-9), #, @ and $
**	  the CM routines will actually enforced this for us.
**
** Inputs:
**	in		The input string to pull characters from
**
** Outputs:
**	out		Buffer for holding the constructed FE name.
**
**	Returns:
**		None.
**	Exceptions:
**		None.
**
** Side Effects:
**	None.
**
** History:
**	09/12/92 (dkh) - Initial version.
