/*
**   IIUGgci_getcid -
**		 Get an identifier string from the internal line.  An
**		 identifier may be delimited or regular, but is always
**		 considered NOT to be in normalized form.  Thus, if it
**		 starts with a double quote, then it must end with a
**		 double quote.
**
**		 Arbitrary white space is allowed following the compound
**		 construct delimiter, but leading white space, e.g.,
**			["]a["] .["]b["]
**		 and comments, e.g.,
**			["]a["] << This is a Comment >> .["]b["]
**		 are not supported.
**
**		 This routine differs from UI/FE_decompose() in that
**		 o Identifiers are unconditionaly treated as being unnormalized.
**		 o It does not utilize the FE_RSLV_NAME structure.
**		 o It does not assume that the identifier is the only
**		   token contained in the input buffer, and so can be
**		   incorporated into client parsers.
**		 o It conditionally recognizes/allows compound constructs.
**
**		 A regular identifier is considered to be terminated by
**		 any character which fails CMnmchar() unless that character
**		 is a period and compound identifiers are valid in this context.
**
**		 A delimited identifier is terminated by whatever character
**		 follows a non-doubled double quote which is not the leading
**		 delimiting double quote.  However, in order to support
**		 constructs of the form ["]a["].["]b["] where a is a correlation
**		 name/owner and b is a columnname/tablename/procedure, look
**		 ahead for a delimiting period and continue if found and
**		 compound constructs are allowed in this context.
**
**		 An identifier (or component thereof) which exceeds the size
**		 of the ident buffer will be silently truncated.
**
** Input:
**	buf	Pointer to the line buffer containing the identifier.
**		The identifier is assumed to start at the beginning of the
**		buffer, but not necessarily to end at the buffer's EOS.
**		If NULL, then this routine becomes an effective no-op.
**	ugid	Pointer to a FE_GCI_IDENT structure.  This should never
**		be specified as NULL if buf is non-NULL.
**	c_ok	TRUE if a compound identifier (["]a["].["]b["]) is
**		allowable in this context.
**
** Output:
**	ugid	Structure filled as follows (even if buf was specified as NULL):
**			name -	 the full text of the identifier string,
**				 unaltered (but perhaps truncated) and NULL
**				 terminated.  Forced to EOS if buf was
**				 specified as NULL.
**			c_oset - offset in name of the compound delimiting
**				 period.  If zero, then the identifier is not
**				 a compound identifier.
**			b_oset - offset in the input buffer where the parse
**				 stopped. This indicates which character
**				 the client should use to resume the parse.
**				 Forced to 0 if buf was specified as NULL.
**			owner -	 the owner/correlationname component, also NULL
**				 terminated.  This is simply separated from
**				 the compound identifier - it is not normalized
**				 in any way.  This reflect EOS if the identifier
**				 is not a compound identifier.
**			object - the object (columnname/tablename/procedure)
**				 component, also NULL terminated.  This is
**				 simply separated from the compound identifier
**				 - it is not normalized in any way.  Forced to
**				 EOS if buf was specified as NULL.
** Returns:
**	TRUE -	buf was specified as NULL
**		-OR-
**		The parse succeeded. This does not guarantee that the resultant
**		identifier and/or its components will pass
**		IIUGdlm_ChkdlmBEobject(), or that unbalanced quotes did
**		not "prematurely" terminate the scan.
**	FALSE -	ugid was specified as NULL and buf was specified as non-NULL
**		-OR -
**		the parse results represent known invalid identifier.
**		Specifically, the identifier construct was of the form:
**			["]owner["].
**			.["]object["]
**			[["]owner["].]""
**			""[.["]object["]]
**		all whitespace, or had an odd number of quotes
**		(not recognized as an error in all cases ...).
**		Note that even under these FAIL conditions, the
**		resultant FE_GCI_IDENT will be filled in an intuitive
**		manner, e.g.,
**			name ==> .["]object["]
**			c_oset ==> 0
**			b_oset ==> 7 (9 if delimited)
**			e_code ==> FE_GCI_BARE_CID
**			owner ==> EOS
**			object ==> ["]object["]
**
** History:
**	14-apr-1993 (rdrane)
**		Created (inspired by the original SREPORT/sgident.c).
**		The quirks of this routine can be traced to the requirements
**		of its initial clients - Report-Writer and 3GL decomposition
**		of owner.procedure constructs.
**	11-jun-1993 (rdrane)
**		Allow for NULL buf and/or ugid.  The former can allegedly occur
**		as a result of:
**			## delete cursor c1;
**
**		Since there's no table name, EQUEL will generate something
**		like:
**
**			IIcsDelete((char *)0,"c1",(int)22616,(int)8082);
**
**		where the first parameter is supposed to be table name and is
**		NULL.  IIcsDelete() calls IIUGgci_getcid() with this NULL
**		pointer, and IIUGgci_getcid() fails with an access violation.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
