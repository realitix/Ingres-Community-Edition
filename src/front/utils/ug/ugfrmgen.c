/*{
** Name:        IIUGcvnCheckVarname - check for valid $var name.
**
** Description:
**      Check for legal $variable name.
**      - Name must start with '$' and contain only alpha-numeric and
**	  underscore characters after that. (i.e. "$", "@", "#" are not
**	  legal characters in a $variable name). This allows us to
**	  make valid substitutions of two $vars right next to each
**	  other in the source; e.g., $var1$var2$var3.
**      - Name length must be <= FE_MAXNAME.
**
** Inputs:
**      varname         - (char *) name of $variable to check.
**
** Outputs:
**
**      Returns:
**              OK if name is valid, else FAIL.
**
** History:
**      19-mar-1992 (pete)
**          Initial version.
**	30-apr-1992 (pete)
**	    Moved from abf!fg!fgdeclar.c to utils!ug so can be shared by Vision
**	    and Windows4gl.
**	19-jun-1992 (pete)
**	    Changed definition of valid $variable from "Name must start with
**	    '$' and contain legal Ingres name characters after that." To:
**	    "Name must start with '$' and contain alpha-numeric and underscore
**	    characters after that". With this change, we will no longer try
**	    to interpret $var1$var2 as a single $variable.
**	12-aug-1992 (pete)
**	    Disallow $variables with names that begin with $ii. These are
**	    reserved for built-in $variables.
**	9-feb-1993 (pete)
**	    Don't flag "$_" or "$ii" as an error.
**	17-mar-1993 (pete)
**	    Require character or underscore in first position of name
**	    (e.g. $123 is illegal).
**	6-aug-93 (blaise)
**	    Changed file name from fgutils.c to ugfrmgen.c, to avoid
**	    duplicating file names.
**	06-dec-1995 (tsale01)
**		Change explicit checks for $variables to use CMnmstart and CMnmchar
**		so it will work for all char sets.
