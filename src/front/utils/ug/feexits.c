/**
** Name:    feexits.c -	Front-End Exits Module.
**
** Description:
**	Contains routines used to set, clear and execute exit clean-up routines
**	for the Front-Ends.  Exit clean-up routines are set by modules that need
**	to do clean-up on exit from an interrupt, e.g., forms.  They will then
**	be executed in LIFO order of their being set upon exit from interrupt.
**
**	This module is usually used by the Front-End Interrupt Handler module
**	and defines:
**
**	FEexits()	execute exit clean-up routines.
**	FEset_exit()	set an exit clean-up routine.
**	FEclr_exit()	clear an exit clean-up routine.
**
**	NOTE:  THIS MODULE CANNOT REPORT BUG CHECKS USING EXCEPTIONS SINCE
**	THAT WOULD CAUSE A RECURSIVE LOOP.  USE 'IIUGerr()' INSTEAD.
**
** History:
**	Revision 6.0  86/12/16  12:22:47  wong
**	Copied real version from "graphics/graf".
**
**	Revision 40.0  86/03/03  15:51:56  wong
**	Initial revision.  (Implemented from a suggestion made by
**	Neil Goodman.)
**
**	01-dec-1999 (rigka01) bug#99200
**	  Attempting to use an ABF application after cancelling out of
**	  killing it results in an access violation.  Check for 0 value
**	  for '*routine' in FEexits() 
**	26-may-2000 (rigka01) bug#101673
**	  compilation of feexits.c fails on UNIX with:
**	  "feexits.c", line 96: controlling expressions must have
**	  scalar type
**	  type cast (*routine) from change for bug #99200 to (i4)
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	21-Aug-2009 (kschendel) 121804
**	    Update some of the function declarations to fix gcc 4.3 problems.
