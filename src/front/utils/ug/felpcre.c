/*{
** Name:    FElpcreate() -	create a list pool
**
**	FElpcreate initializes a status structure which will later be used
**	to dynamically manage a free list of nodes via calls to FElpget
**	and FElpret.  The status structure basically contains the size
**	of the nodes on the list, used only when allocating another chain
**	of them onto the free list, a free list pointer, and a tag. Since
**	passing bad status pointers might not cause immediate failures,
**	and be hard to trace, the structure also contains an element which
**	is set to an unlikely value by this routine, a value which will
**	be checked for in FElpdestroy, FElpget and FElpret.
**
**	Parameters:
**		size		- size of the nodes on this list.
**
**	Returns:
**		FREELIST pointer to associate with the pool, NULL
**		for failure
**
**	Assumptions:
**		Some knowledge of how FEtalloc allocates memory
**		is reflected in here to make efficient use of it.
**
**	Side Effects:
**		None.
**
**	History:
**		1/14/85 (rlm) - First written.
**		13-jul-87 (bab)	Changed memory allocation to use [FM]Ereqmem.
**		29-jul-1992 (rdrane)
**			Modify declaration of FE_allocsize from "extern i4" to
**			"GLOBALREF i4".
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
