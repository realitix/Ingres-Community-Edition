/*{
** Name:    iiugfrs_setting() -	Setup routines for use in utilities
**
** Description:
**	This routine sets up pointers to routine names to perform
**	utility functions.  The need for this is caused by the 
**	fact that the forms system is large, and some of the 
**	frontends (such as the report writer) do not need to use
**	it.  However, it is useful to have a single set of utilies
**	routines that can be used in all frontends.  In order to do
**	this, the iiugfrs_setting routine is called whenever a frontend
**	changes into or out of forms mode, telling whether going
**	in or out of forms mode.  This then sets pointers to
**	routines in the forms system to do the utility functions.
**	When the utility functions are called, they call the
**	forms system function if the address is set, else do a
**	non-forms mode of the function.
**
**	The primary utilities using this function (as of this
**	writing) are FEmsg, FEcopyright, and iiugerr (the error
**	routine).
**
** Inputs:
**	msg_function	Address of the routine to call by FEmsg
**			and FEcopyright.
**	err_function	Address of the routine to call by iiugerr
**
** Side Effects:
**	Sets global pointers IIugmfa_msg_function and IIugefa_err_function.
**
** History:
**	5-apr-1987 (peter)	Written.
