/*{
** Name:    FElpget() -	get a node
**
**	FEndget returns an available node of the size referred to in
**	the FREELIST block passed to it, which should have been obtained
**	using FElpcreate.  The node will be pulled from the free list.  If
**	the free list is empty, a new block of memory is allocated and
**	chained into the free list first.  This routine and FElpopen use
**	the FE_allocsize variable to pass efficient sizes to
**	allocation routines.
**
**	Parameters:
**		lpp		- FREELIST structure for node pool
**
**	Returns:
**		pointer to node, or NULL for failure
**
**	Assumptions:
**		Some knowledge of how FEreqmem allocates memory
**		is reflected in here to make efficient use of it.
**
**	Side Effects:
**		None.
**
**	History:
**		1/14/85 (rlm) - First written.
**		13-jul-87 (bab)	Changed memory allocation to use [FM]Ereqmem.
**		29-jul-1992 (rdrane)
**			Modify declaration of FE_allocsize from "extern i4" to
**			"GLOBALREF i4".
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
