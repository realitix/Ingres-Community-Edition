/*{
** Name:	fmt_areasize	-    Returns the size of the area needed
**				     to build a FMT structure.
**
** Description:
**	Given a format string, this routine returns the size
**	of the memory area needed to build a FMT structure.
**
** Inputs:
**	cb		Points to the current ADF_CB
**			control block.
**
**	fmtstr		The format string for which to build a FMT structure.
**
**	size		Must point to a nat.
**
** Outputs:
**	size		Will point to an allocated FMT structure that
**			corresponds to the format string.
**
**	Returns:
**		E_DB_OK		If it completed successfully.
**		E_DB_ERROR	If some error occurred.
**
**		If an error occurred, the caller can look in the field
**		cb->adf_errcb.ad_errcode to determine the specific error.
**		The following is a list of possible error codes that can be
**		returned by this routine:
**
**		E_FM6000_NULL_ARGUMENT		One of the pointer parameters
**						to this routine was NULL.
** **
** History:
**	19-dec-86 (grant)	implemented.
**	9/8/89 (elein)
**		Add single quote recognition
**	08/16/91 (tom) support for input masking of dates, and string templates
** 12/23/91 (elein) 41634
**    Date and String templates are valid with capital and lower case 'D'
**    and 'S' and may have white space between the letter and the quoted
**    template. fsp[-1] (sic) referenced the space before the quote and
**    not the 'd' for date templates. Capitals weren't tested for at all.
**    This caused some of the date and string templates to not have the
**    width set properly to include the input masking requirements.  
**    Inadequate space was then allocated, and subsequently overrun.
**    This was causing obscure memory allocation problems later in the
**    (this case) report.
** 12/23/91 (elein) 41634 addendum
**    going too fast...Tom points out that there can be a leading alignment
**    character...rework the way we decide if it is a date or string template.
** 19-mar-1998 (rodjo04)
**    Bug 89793  Strings can begin with either a single quote or double 
**    quote and therefore we must check to see which is the first. We must do 
**    this inorder to allocate enough space for FMT.
