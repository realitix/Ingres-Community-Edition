/*
**   F_COLFMT - return one column of a string, formatted by justification
**	or folding if requested.  This routine should be called by a
**	higher level routine in a loop to return lines which are to printed
**	in column format.
**
**	This routine defines the end of a word as a blank, tab, or newline.
**	Note that newlines return immediately.	Tabs round to the nearest
**	column a multiple of eight (relative to the start).  If more than
**	one blank in a row is found, the second (and subsequent blanks)
**	will always be retained.  This routine always pads with blanks
**	to the end of BUF.
**
**	Parameters:
**		string	workspace containing the string to format.
**		buf	buffer to put formatted string into.
**		width	the width of one column.
**		type	type of formatting.  Values are:
**			F_C	simply transfer to the string, and
**				truncate when "width" characters transferred,
**				whether in the middle of a word or not.
**			F_CF	fold the string, that is break at the end
**				of a word (if possible).
**			F_CFE	same as F_CF but trailing spaces are preserved 
**				rather than compressed.
**			F_CJ	justify the string, that is fold and then
**				pad with blanks at word boundaries to right
**				justify the string.
**			F_CJE	same as F_CJ but preserve trailing spaces.
**			F_CU	fold the string, break at quoted strings
**				as well as words (internal format used by
**				unloaddb()).
**			F_T	same as F_C, except represent control characters
**				as \c or \ddd.
**		mark_byte1 	TRUE to insert a special marker when splitting a 
**				2-byte char.  FALSE to insert a space.  It is
**				really only applicable to multi line formatting.
**	Returns:
**		OK
**
**	Called by:
**		User.
**
**	Side Effects:
**		Updates buf.
**
**	Error Messages:
**		none.
**
**	History:
**		7/25/81 (ps)	written.
**		1/12/85 (rlm)	modified for cfe, keeping data for
**				adjustment as search is done rather than
**				rescanning string, and making use of some
**				CL calls
**		2/12/86 (drh)	modified to not add a hyphen when splitting a
**				word.
**		10/20/86 (KY)  -- Changed CH.h to CM.h.
**	12-dec-86 (grant)	changed to handle text strings instead of
**				null-terminated C strings.
**				added F_T format.
**	28-aug-87 (rdesmond)	enhanced to wrap on '(', ')' and ',' as well 
**				as white space.  Also now avoids wrapping 
**				within strings if possible.
**	10/28/87 (dkh) - Changed to leave control chars alone, unless
**			 it is a \t, \r or \n.
**	20-apr-89 (cmr)		Modification to rdesmond change of 28-aug-87.
**				Break on quoted strings *only* for the
**				format F_CU (used internally by unloaddb()).
**	25-jul-89 (cmr)		Fix for bug 6398 -- do not treat delimiters 
**				like whitespace.  When we reach the point of 
**				folding (wrapping) do NOT set 'fold' to TRUE 
**				if the next src char is a delimiter otherwise 
**				that character gets dropped!
**	26-jul-89 (cmr)		Fix for bug 5069 -- if the last byte in the 
**				formatted buf is the first byte of a 2-byte 
**				char then "fix" the byte and set fmws_text 
**				so that the entire char gets read the next
**				time through.  If mark_byte1 is TRUE then 
**				insert a special marker else insert a space.  
**				Only applicable to multi line format.
**	28-jul-89 (cmr)		Add support for new formats 'cfe' and 'cje'.  
**				Preserve trailing spaces rather than 
**				compressing them.
**	18-Aug-89 (kathryn)	Addition to bug fix 5069.
**		Ensure strptr is on the last byte of the formatted buffer.
**      21-feb-90 (stevet)      Fixed Kanji blank (Bug #9466) problem as well
**                              as a number of display problems with Kanji
**                              characters when using the 'cf' and 'cj'
**                              formats.  Convert Kanji blank to two spaces when
**                              using formats other than F_C and F_T formats.
**	27-mar-90 (cmr)		Fixed jupbug #20203.  Ignore trailing blanks 
**				for format CJ.  This bug was introduced when 
**				the new format CJE was added.
**	15-apr-90 (cmr)		Rewrote the code that handles folding on quoted
**				strings.  It now handles single quotes as well
**				as double quotes and it can handle a quoted 
**				string that spans lines or is unterminated.
**	17-apr-90 (cmr)		Fix for b9835.  Don't fold on open paren '('.
**	15-feb-91 (mgw)		Make F_inquote a i4  to match GLOBALREF in
**				fmmulti.c and use F_INQ and F_NOQ for TRUE and
**				FALSE in quote tests.
**	3/21/91 (elein)		(b35574) Add parameter for FRS, boxed messages
**				which need to change control characters to
**				spaces in order to display boxed messages
**				correctly.  For internal use only.
**	10/16/92 (dkh) - Fixed f_colfmt() so that it does not format beyond
**			 the end of the user's buffer.
**	10/19/92 (dkh) - Free up old memory area before allocating a new one.
**	11/04/92 (dkh) - Fixed bug 47702.  Justification format changed the
**			 original "width" value that was passed in.  This caused
**			 an incorrect amount of data to be passed back.  We
**			 now save off the width value and use that when moving
**			 data.
**	11/06/92 (fredv) - Replace the STlcopy() calls with MEcopy()'s
**			because STlcopy will write the extra null byte
**			to terminate the string and write beyond the
**			user buffer.
**      04/03/93 (smc) - Cast parameter of MEfree to match prototype.
**	07/10/93 (dkh) - Fixed bug 41631.  For the CU format, hex literal
**			 strings (x'NN' or X'NN') will now be kept
**			 together when folding strings.
**	08/31/93 (dkh) - Fixed up compiler complaints due to prototyping.
**      11/30/94 (harpa06) - Integrated bug fix #63235 from 6.4 codeline by
**                       abowler: handle delimiters when justifying strings.
**	07/04/95 (kch) - Fix bug 53327 - remove repeated output when
**			 the T format is used to print a varchar by
**                       presetting the user's buffer to blanks.
**  02/05/95 (kch) - Fix bug 64312 - add leading blanks when the F_CU
**           format is used by unloaddb in the creation of the
**           cp[username].in files.
**           This compensates for the removal of blanks when
**           the procedure text (column text_segment in the
**           database catalogue iiprocedures) spans multiple
**           lines in the cp[username].in files (when
**           text_segment is greater than XF_LINELEN (70)
**           characters).
**    23/05/95 (kch) - Fix bug 52238 - check that a second (escaped)
**             single quotation mark in the procedure text is not
**             the XF_LINELENth (70th) character (the previous
**             change added a leading blank so the bug now occurs
**             if the second single quote is the 70th and not the
**             71st character).
**  26/07/95 (kch) - Fix bug 70127 - this bug is a side effect of the
**           fix for bug 64312. The incrementing of the counter i,
**           to compensate for the addition of a leading blank,
**           is lost when a tab is processed. Therefore, the
**           counter must be decremented so that the tabbing
**           is correct and then 're-incremented'.
**  30-nov-1995 (angusm)
**          bug 71653, DOUBLEBYTE only. We can reposition
**          too early after a fold, and get ourselves
**          into an infinite loop.
**  12-feb-1996 (kch)
**	    Tidy up previous tab processing change (for bug 70127, which was
**	    a side effect of the fix for bug 64312). We now re-increment the
**	    counter i after c and cprev have been assigned. Previously, an
**	    extra blank was being incorrectly added by the c = bufstart + i
**	    assignment. This change fixes bug 74264.
**  01-apr-1996 (tsale01)
**		Further to fix by angusm for bug 71653, make sure the folding
**		is not done for unloaddb or copydb as we definitely want to
**		fold at delimiters or spaces only.
**		Original fix can split names arbitrarily into two chunks.
**		The two chunks are then read in as two separate names!
**  09-jul-1996 (kch)
**		Check that i is less than width before re-incrementing after
**		tab processing.
**  14-Feb-1997 (hanal04)
**          Due to the fix for bug# 64312 and the introduction of single quotes
**          (re: 15-apr-1990) in some instance an additional white space is
**          inserted to character strings. See scripts for Bug# 80739. Changed
**          function f_colfmt to treat double quotes that follow an open
**          single quote as literals.
**  25-sep-96 (mcgem01)
**              Global data moved to fmtdata.c
**  28-Jul-1998 (nicph02)
**          Bug 89352: The processing of a  literal single quote
**          - coded as '' (for \') - was confusing the algorithm
**         which thought that a single quote string was closed.
**  03-jul-98 (hayke02)
**	    Various changes to correct problems with folding quoted strings in
**	    procedure text which is formatted during copydb/unloaddb. For
**	    various scenarios, the F_inquote global was not being maintained
**	    correctly. This change fixes bug 91825.
**	24-nov-1998 (kitch01)
**		Bug 94226. Amend f_delim() to also check for '+'.
**	09-Jul-1999 (carsu07)
**	    When multiple quotes occur at the end of a line of procedure text 
**	    and need to be folded onto the next line the quotes are split 
**	    incorrectly. The F_inquote global needs to be set. (Bug 96734)
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	25-jan-2002 (rigka01) bug #81256
**	     if folding occurs within a quoted string and the string contains
**	     more than one blank before the point of fold, the blanks are
**	     lost. Fix is in f_colfmt(). 
**      21-Apr-2003 (drivi01)
**           Crossed unsubmitted change from 2.5 done by huazh01 to fix
**           bug 107358, INGSRV1730.  After including the fix for 81256,
**           F_inquote global was not being set properly.  This leads to an
**           error when we need to fold a string located inside double quotes.
**       1-Apr-2003 (hanal04) Bug 109584 INGSRV 2102
**           F_CU used by copydb used spaces as padding. This padding was
**           then stripped in t_getline in xferdb. This has lead to bug
**           after bug and a level of unecessary complexity in this
**           function.
**           This change implements NULL padding for the F_CU format
**           and prevents multiple bugs by implementing the very simple
**           rule of not folding if we are in quoted strings. Though
**           quoted words may now be split across lines the text in
**           the quotes is the text that's returned.
**      28-May-2003 (hanal04) Bug 107358 INGSRV1730, Bug 110296 INGSRV2275
**           Original fix for Bug 107358 introduces bug 110296.
**           Rewrite that fix to ensure folding on double quotes
**           adjusts strptr accordingly before we exit.
**	30-jun-2003 (drivi01)
**	     Fixed f_colfmt method to think that comma separated float or
**	     decimal are part of one word and shouldn't be broken into two
**	     lines when we run copydb/unloaddb.
**	11-jul-2003 (gupsh01)
**	     Fixed f_colfmt so that the double quoted long strings for F_CU
**	     unloaddb/copydb case, are dealt correctly. Previously the data
**	     between the fold point and the last open quote was missed out in 
**	     copying to the output. 
**      30-Sep-2003 (hanal04) Bug 110748 INGCBT 486
**           Extend the above change so that '\0' characters are replaced
**           with spaces when we skip over characters in the output
**           stream, as we do for the '\t' case.
**	21-Oct-2003 (rigka01) bug #110759
**	     Fixed f_colfmt for II_DECIMAL when it occurs at the line
**	     width. Followed precedent for fixing bug 109912.
**       6-Nov-2003 (hanal04) Bug 111244 INGDBA265
**           Remove changes for bug 70127. We don't have the leading space
**           anymore and this change causes nb to be set incorrectly
**           during tab processing.
**           Rewrite change for bug 110527 which was incorrectly adjusting
**           strptr for testcase2 of this bug.
**           Went on to create testcase3. Found that delimite table names
**           must not be folded inside the doubquote. Instead we adjust
**           the fold_point to the last open quote.
**      30-Apr-2004 (hanal04) bug 112244 INGSRV2810
**           Set F_inquote to true if we are in a local_quote and returning
**           because we found "\n" or "\r". Failure to do so causes us to
**           lose track of the fact that we are in quotes.
**	13-Aug-2004 (hanal04/raodi01) bug 112196 ingsrv2804
**	    Escaped quotes that was split is causing problem. Hence it is moved
**	    a character back and adjust width to force the escaped quotes to be
**	    handled in the next line
**	    Also whenever escaped quotes are encountered,it is being checked  
**	    if either local_quote is TRUE or F_inquote is set to F_INQ
**	29-Nov-2004 (raodi01) bug 112714 ingsrv2869
**	   Included double quotes as part of escaped quotes handling.
**	19-Jan-2005 (raodi01) bug 113656 INGSRV3097
**	   Handling of characters within double quotes when the number of 
**	   characters goes beyond 70. Wrapping is done instead of folding. 
**	16-Nov-2004 (komve01)
**	    Updated so that copy.in works right for views. Bug 113498.
**	30-Nov-2004 (komve01)
**	    Undo changes of Bug 113498, earlier submission.Added = as one of 
**	    delimiters for folding, so that copy.in works correct for long
**	    table and column names.
**	29-Dec-2004 (komve01)
**	    Added the type F_CU when considering = as a delimiter.
**	24-Feb-2005 (komve01)
**	    Bug #113950/ Issue #:13976988
**	    Added local_quote as additional condition while checking for Kanji
**	    spaces, in case of a double quoted column name with a white space in
**	    its name.
**       18-apr-2006 (stial01)
**          Handle procedure comments, because quote inside comment should not
**          be parsed as string delimiter (b115704)
**          Moved fcolfmt global and static variables to FM_WORKSPACE
