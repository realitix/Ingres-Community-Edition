** Name:	uglower.c -	Front-End Utility DBMS Case Matching Module.
**
** Description:
**	Contains routines to adjust the case of a DBMS object name, which may
**	be a delimited identifier.  All new code is expected to use the
**	IIUGdlm_ChkdlmBEobject() and/or IIUGdbo_dlmBEobject() routine.  The
**	IIUGlbo_lowerBEobject() routine, which historically lowered a DBMS object
**	name only if it was INGRES and hence the "lower" in the routine name, is
**	retained for compatibility, but will simply reference the new routine.
**
**
** History:
**	5-nov-1987 danielt written
**	5-jun-92 (rdrane)
**		Added the IIUGdbo_dlmBEobject() routine to support casing of delimited
**		identifiers (Release 6.5).
**	26-jun-92 (rdrane)
**		Added more routines to support delimited identifiers.
**		IIUGdlm_ChkdlmBEobject() accepts a string, determines if it is a
**		delimited identifier, and conditionally resolves it to its BE
**		representation.  String has the form ["]name["].  IIUGrqd_Requote_dlm()
**		re-quotes a delimited identifier (or any string) and re-escapes any
**		embedded double quotes.
**	16-jul-92 (rdrane)
**		IIUGdlm_ChkdlmBEobject() changes.  Handle STtrmwhite() overzealousness.
**		Conditionalize SQL reserved word lookup.
**	31-jul-92 (rdrane)
**		IIUGdlm_ChkdlmBEobject() changes - effect identifier validation and
**		return indication of identifier type or invalid.
**	11-aug-1992 (rdrane)
**		Fix-up handling of underscore in IIUGdlm_ChkdlmBEobject().
**	18-aug-1992 (rdrane)
**		Fix-up handling of INGRES "special characters" in
**		IIUGdlm_ChkdlmBEobject().  Watch for calls when pre-6.5 connection.
**		Use IIUGIsSQLKeyWord() since IIUGsrw_LookUp() is now defunct.
**	04-sep-1992 (rdrane)
**		Finalize validation of delimited ID's.  Add static routine
**		IIUGdic_ChkdlmChar().
**	14-sep-1992 (rdrane)
**		Explicitly check for terminating delimiting quote in
**		IIUGdlm_ChkdlmBEobject() if is_nrml is FALSE.
**	15-sep-1992 (rdrane)
**		Explicitly fail otherwise delimited ID in IIUGdlm_ChkdlmBEobject()
**		if is_nrml is FALSE and it does not have delimiting quotes.  Correct
**		handling of overlapping strings.
**	1-oct-1992 (rdrane)
**		Add IIUGxri_id().
**	14-oct-1992 (rdrane)
**		Allow $, #, @ in delimited identifiers.
**	20-oct-1993 (rdrane)
**		Allow # and @ to be the initial character of a delimited identifier.
**	14-jan-1994 (rdrane)
**		Added single quote escape/de-escape routines.
**  	16-jun-95 (harpa06)
**              Changed UGlbo_lowerBEobject() so that if the object to be 
**		converted is a delimited id, don't do it.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	24-Aug-2009 (kschendel) 121804
**	    Update some of the function declarations to fix gcc 4.3 problems.
**      01-apr-2010 (stial01)
**          Changes for Long IDs

/*
** Name:	IIUGdlm_ChkdlmBEobject()
**
** Description:
**	Accepts a string, determines if it is a delimited identifier, and
**	conditionally normalizes it to its BE representation.  String has the form
**              ["]name["]
**	Determination rules depend upon whether or not the name is specified as
**	already being normalized, i.e., retrieved from the database vs. from user
**	input (command line, language, forms prompt).
**
**	The string is examined for otherwise invalid INGRES name characters (e.g.,
**	", space, ., etc.).  If any are found, then the string is determined to be
**	a delimited identifier.  Note that this test will treat the presence of
**	quotes as indicating delimited regardless of origin (command line/database).
**	Note also that while the ANSI standard is more restrictive than INGRES,
**	any occurance of the characters #, $, @, or underscore will NOT by
**	themselves cause the string to be considered delimited.  However,
**	identifiers which begin with the character $ will continue to be
**  considered delimited.
**
**  The presence of SQL pattern matching characters (escaped or not) will
**	cause the string to be considered delimited.
**
**	Trailing blanks are always stripped, and do not automatically denote that
**	the string is a delimited identifier.  Note that they should never exist
**	in the database, and that if significant on user input, then the delimiting
**	quotes will be present anyway!
**
**	If the resultant string is lexically equivalent to an SQL reserved word
**	(after stripping blanks and regardless of case), then it is determined to
**	be a delimited identifier.
**
**	If is_nrml is TRUE and the string does not match case-wise, then it is
**	determined to be a delimited identifier.  Note that when the match indicates
**	that it could be either, we decide in favor of the regular identifier!
**	For the specific instances of INGRES (lower,lower) and FIPS (UPPER,Mixed)
**		Contains chars		INGRES		FIPS
**	   ----------------	   --------	   ------
**		all lower			regular		delimited
**		all UPPER			 -----		regular
**		Mixed				 -----		delimited
**
**	Thus, in the absence of special characters or keyword matches, all
**	names retrieved from INGRES databases will be considered regular
**	identifiers.
**
**	This routine diagnoses unbalanced delimiting and/or escaped quotes
**	and input/resultant strings greater than DB_MAX_DELIMID/DB_MAXNAME.
**  In these cases it returns indication that the identifier is invalid.
**
**	If is_nrml is FALSE, then unless the string is explicitly delimited,
**	any determinitation that the identifier is delimited results in its
**	being declared invalid.
**
**	When connected to a pre-6.5 database, all delimited identifiers are
**	considered to be invalid!
**
**
**	This routine will not recognize and/or decompose an owner.tablename
**	construct.  Use FE_decompose() and then call this routine for each part.
**
** Input:
**	name		Character pointer to NULL terminated string which is the
**				identifier to be checked and optionally resolved.
**	strip_name	Character pointer to a buffer of at least (DB_MAXNAME + 1)
**				or NULL.
**	is_nrml		If TRUE, then the name is in normalized form.  In that case,
**				any quotes found are expected to represent non-escaped embedded
**				quotes, and case matching is a determining factor.  If FALSE,
**				then a leading quote is a delimiter, embedded quotes are
**				expected to be escaped, and case is not a factor in determining
**				delimited/regular status.
**
** Output:
**	name		Any trailing whitespace will be trimmed from name.  This is
**				more of a side effect than a feature.
**	strip_name	Conditionally set to contain the resolved identifier.
**				If non-NULL on input, then the input string minus any
**				delimiting quotes, escaping quotes, trailing spaces, and
**				properly cased is placed there.  If the return status is
**				UI_BOGUS_ID, then this will reflect EOS.
**
** Returns:
**	i4			UI_REG_ID   - valid regular identifier
**				UI_DELIM_ID - valid delimited identifier
**				UI_BOGUS_ID - invalid identifier (includes NULL pointer and
**							  empty string cases).
**
** Side Effects:
**	IIUGdbo_dlmBEobject() is called if strip_name was specified as non_NULL,
**	and may have have potential side effects of its own, specifically
**	IIUIdbdata() may be called, and will set up the static DB capabilities
**	structure if it is not already set up.
**
** History:
**	26-jun-92 (rdrane)
**		Created.
**	16-jul-92 (rdrane)
**		STtrmwhite() can return an empty string if all whitespace - need to
**		detect this and force the result to be one space.  Conditionalize
**		SQL reserved word lookup - only do it if not already considered
**		delimited.  Handle NULL pointer/empty input string gracefully.
**	31-jul-1992 (rdrane)
**		Because of conflicts/inadequacies with FEchkname(), do full validation
**		of the identifier here, and change the return from a boolean
**		delimited/regular indicator to a i4  delimited/regular/bogus indicator.
**		Expand the local s_name buffer to handle a badly formed escaped
**		delimited identifier.  Use the input name directly.  Treat input string
**		as unsigned so we don't get differing results if 8-bit characters.
**	11-aug-1992 (rdrane)
**		Renamed in_quote to start-quote for readability.  Removed test for
**		is_nrml FALSE within test for start_quote since start_quote will never
**		be set to TRUE if is_nrml is specified as TRUE.  Underscore is valid
**		in regular identifier so long as it's not the last character.
**	18-aug-1992 (rdrane)
**		Because of backwards compatibility considerations, instances of
**		@,$,#, and underscore will NOT cause the identifier to be
**		considered delimited.  Note that the "Underscore is valid
**      in regular identifier so long as it's not the last character" is
**		Intermediate SQL, and we're only doing Entry SQL right now.
**		If we're connected to a pre-6.5 database, then any delimited
**		identifier is actually invalid.  Call the "existing" IIUGIsSQLKeyWord()
**		routine instead of the now defunct IIUGsrw_LookUp().
**	04-sep-1992 (rdrane)
**		Finalize validation of delimited ID's.  Add static routine
**		IIUGdic_ChkdlmChar().
**	14-sep-1992 (rdrane)
**		Explicitly check for terminating delimiting quote.  It wasn't
**		treating "abc as UI_BOGUS_ID if is_nrml is FALSE.
**	15-sep-1992 (rdrane)
**		Explicitly fail otherwise delimited ID in IIUGdlm_ChkdlmBEobject()
**		if is_nrml is FALSE and it does not have delimiting quotes.
**		Thus, abc" will now fail if is_nrml is FALSE.  Correct handling of
**		overlaping strings.  The clearing of strip_name reduced the input to
**		an empty string.  So, ignore clearing strip_name!
**	14-oct-1992 (rdrane)
**		Allow $, #, @ in delimited identifiers (the LRC has spoken!).
**	18-mar-1993 (rdrane)
**		Screen out totally bogus unnormalized delim identifiers - |"|, |""|.
**		These were being passed as "delimited, equivalent to one space".  Note
**		that the new logic also provides for immediate detection of invalid
**		unnormalized delim identifiers of the form |"x| (one character, no
**		terminating quote).  This fixes bug 50519.
**	 31-dec-1993 (rdrane)
**		Use dlm_Case capability directly to determine if delimited identifiers
**		are suppported.
**       22-sep-1995 Bug# 71533 (lawst01)
**              removed test of is_dlm switch from check of valid delimited
**              characters.

**	The string is not expected to have extraneous trailing blanks, is not
**	expected to exceed DB_MAXNAME in length, and is	expected to be NULL
**	terminated.
**
**	It would be nice to migrate this routine to ST and have it
**	become part of the CL.
**
** Input:
**	in_str		Character pointer to the NULL terminated string to be
**				quoted.  Assumed to reside in a buffer of max length
**				(DB_MAXNAME + 1).
**	out_str		Character pointer to the buffer in which to place the
**				result string, which will be delimited and have double
**				quote characters escaped.  Assumed to go into a buffer with
**				a minimum of (DB_MAX_DELIMID + 1) available length.
**
** Output:
**	out_str		The re-quoted string representation of the input.  A NULL
**				or empty input string will be reflected as "".
**
** Returns:
**	Nothing.
**
** Side Effects:
**	None.
**
** History:
**	26-jun-92 (rdrane)
**		Created
**	16-jul-92 (rdrane)
**		Handle NULL pointers/empty input string gracefully.

/*
** Name:	IIUGxri_id()
**
** Description:
**	Un-normalizes an identifier for display in a user-modifiable or
**	inclusion in generated procedural language output senario.
**	If id is determined to be a regular identifier, then it is simply
**	copied.  If id is determined to be a delimited identifier, then it
**	un-normalizes the identifier via IIUGrqd_Requote_dlm().
**
**	This routine is essentially a cover for the sequence
**		IIUGdlm_ChkdlmBEobject() (both components)
**		STcopy()/IIUGrqd_Requote_dlm()
**	and is intended for clients which need to externalize identifiers
**	already in normalized form (e.g., from a database) and which
**	have not already determined and/or saved the identifier's type.
**
**	If the client knows the identifier type, then it is much more
**	efficient to call STcopy()/IIUGrqd_Requote_dlm() directly and
**	avoid the non-trivial overhead of re-determination.
**
** Input:
**	id			Pointer to the identifier to be un-normalized.
**	result_id	Pointer to a field in which to place the un-normalized
**				identifier.  This should be at least (DB_MAX_DELIMID + 1)
**				bytes in length.
** Output:
**	result_id	Set to the un-normalized identifier or EOS if id
**				is UI_BOGUS_ID and not the catalog owner
**				(UI_FE_CAT_ID_65).
**
** Returns:
**	bool		TRUE/FALSE depending upon the return status of
**				IIUGdlm_ChkdlmBEobject().  FALSE is set only
**				for UI_BOGUS_ID where the id is NOT the catalog
**				owner (UI_FE_CAT_ID_65).
**
** History:
**	1-oct-1992 (rdrane)
**		Created.
**	29-apr-1993 (rdrane)
**		Allow the catowner (nominally $ingres) as a valid ID, even though
**		IIUGdlm_ChkdlmBEobject() will declare it to be UI_BOGUS_ID.
