/**
** Name:    iiuicw.qc -		Front-End DBMS Catalog Write Control Module.
**
** Description:
**	Contains routines that enable and disable updates to the FE catalogs.
**	The 6.0 DBMS prevents Frontend catalogs from being updated (or created
**	or destroyed) unless 'iiuicw1_CatWriteOn()' has been called.
**
**	This file defines:
**
**	iiuicw1_CatWriteOn()	Turn on catalog writing capability.
**	iiuicw0_CatWriteOff()	Turn off catalog writing capability.
**
**	(the mnemonic is based on the 1/0 labels of hardware on/off switches)
**
** History:
**	15-apr-1987 (sandyd)
**		Initial stubbed version created.
**	21-apr-1987 (sandyd)
**		Implemented with call to LIBQ function.
**	18-dec-1987 (danielt)
**		Made a no-op against a gateway
**	26-feb-1991 (pete)
**		Made it NOT a no-op against Star (which speaks UI_DML_GTWSQL).
