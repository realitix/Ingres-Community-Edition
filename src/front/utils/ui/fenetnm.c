/**
** Name:	fenetname.c -	Front-End Net Name Routine.
**
** Descriaption:
**	Routine to break a database entered by the user into two
**	components, a network node name and the name of the
**	database on the node.  If a node name can not be decyphered
**	then the whole name is assumed to be just a database name.
**
**	Bugs:  Does not check for existence of a NULL node or
**	db name.  This doesn't care, since we leave it to
**	INingres to try and start up the database.
**
** History:
**	Revision 6.2  89/06 bobm
**	Strip off /ANYTHING, since we now have "/star" also.  Perhaps the stuff
**	    after the slash should get passed back in nodename, but since the
**	    "/d" wasn't, I won't.
**	89/10/26  terryr  Added length argument to STindex("/") call, omission
**	    worked in some cases but was munging dbname assignment in others.
**	89/10/26  wong  Rewrote to remove unnecessary copy.
**
**	Saturn changes: 11-oct-1986 (sandyd)
**	This routine now strips off the "/d" (if any) from
**	the end of the database name.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
