/**
** Name:	uicnl.qc - FE Catalog Nolock routines
**
** Description:
**	Because of the default transaction semantics in SQL (i.e., implicit
**	multistatement transactions), we have to be careful about the
**	performance implications of concurrency control.
**
**	The routines in this file are used to temporarily set readlock=nolock
**	so that we don't lock up our catalogs unnecessarily.  These routines
**	only need to be used by the portions of our code which could be
**	executed from within USER PROGRAMS.
**
**	This file defines:
**
**	IIUIcnb_CatNolockBegin()	Begin catalog nolock mode on 
**					specified catalog.
**	
**	IIUIcne_CatNolockEnd()		End catalog nolock mode on 
**					specified catalog.
**
** History:
**	24-apr-1987 (sandyd)
**		Created.
**	12/11/87 (dkh) - Fixed jup bug 1584.

/*{
** Name:	IIUIcnb_CatNolockBegin() - Begin catalog nolock mode
**
** Description:
**	This routine sets the lockmode of the specified table so that
**	we won't inadvertently lock up our catalogs just by reading them.
**	(SQL implicit multistatement transactions makes this a significant 
**	danger.)
**
**	This should be called prior to reading any FE catalogs (in code
**	which might get executed from within USER APPLICATIONS -- i.e.,
**	FRS, OSL).
**
** Inputs:
**	catname		Name of catalog you want to start reading.
**
** Outputs:
**	none
**
**	Returns:
**		none
**	Exceptions:
**		none
**
** Side Effects:
**	none
**
** History:
**	24-apr-1987 (sandyd)
**		Created.
