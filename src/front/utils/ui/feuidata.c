/**
** Name:	feuidata.c -	Front-End DBMS Environment Data Definitions.
**
** Description:
**	Contains the definitions of the data that describes the current DBMS
**	environment.  Defines
**
**	IIUIfedata	          - Returns structure containing non-DBMS 
**				    information.
**	IIUIdbdata	          - Return structure describing current DBMS 
**				    connection.
**	IIUIcddCheckDBdata        - same as IIUIdbdata(), but return NULL if no
**				    structure exists yet.
**	IIUIssdStoreSessionData   - Store DBMS connection info.
**	IIUIpsdPartialSessionData - Store DBMS connection info about a 
**				    partial session.
**
** History:
**	Revision 6.5
**	21-sep-92 (davel)
**		Add IIUIcddCheckDBdata() to return connection info if it
**		exists (as IIUIdbdata() would), but return NULL if it does not
**		exist yet to let client take appropriate action.
**
**	Revision 6.4  1991/05/05  wong
**	Added capability version levels.
**	1991/08  wong  Set application flag for sessions initialized through
**		'IIUIdbdata()'.  Bug #38671.
**
**	Revision 6.3
**	30-nov-1989 (Mike S)
**		move global data into structure
**	25-feb-1990 (Mike S)
**		Add prompt_func entry
**	16-aug-1990 (Joe)
**	    Made two separate structures UIGDATA and UIDBDATA for non-DBMS
**	    and DBMS information.  Changed to use global function 'IIUIdbdata()'
**	    to get at the DBMS information this supports multiple DBMS sessions.
**	27-aug-1990 (Joe)
**	    Added support for ROstatus for DB/SQL.
**	28-sep-1990 (Joe)
**	    Changed the meaning of firstAutoCom to be what IIui1stAutoCom
**	    used to be.  Added entryAC to hold the autocommit state on
**	    entry to a shared session.
**
**	Revision 6.2  88/12  wong
**	Added 'IIUIisdba'.
**
**	Revision 6.0  88/01/18  wong
**	Extracted definitions from "feingres.qsc".
**	9-mar-1988 (danielt)
**		added  IIUIsuser, IIUIsdba, IIUIcatowner
**	24-apr-a996 (chech02)
**		added function prototypes for windows 3.1 port.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main

/*
** Access to the DBMS specific structure is through the global function
** IIUIdbdata.  This function returns a pointer to a UIDBDATA structure.
** The reason a global pointer can't be used is that with multiple sessions,
** when the session is switched, a different structure is needed for in the
** information relavant to the particular DBMS session being run.  If we
** were using a global pointer, when the DBMS session is switched, the
** pointer would be switched to point to a different structure. However,
** the way that global pointers can be supported in VMS transfer vectors,
** means that the global pointer in the transfer vector is actually a
** different piece of memory than the global pointer inside the shared
** library.  In this case there are 2 IIUIgdata's.  When code inside the
** shared library refers to IIUIgdata, it actually references  the piece of
** memory allocated by the GLOBALDEF above.  When code outside the shared
** library refers to IIUIgdata, it references a piece of memory inside
** the transfer vector.  Code inside the shared image can not change the
** value of the pointer in the transfer vector.  Thus, IIUIgdata works
** since it always points at the same piece of memory, but something
** like an IIUIdbdata pointer for the DBMS data would not work.
**
** The above comment is no longer accurate since IIUIgdata was changed
** from a function to a routine, but the principal of how global data
** can be put into a transfer vector is correct.

/*{
** Name:	IIUIdbdata() -	Return pointer to global data.
**
** Description:
**	This function returns a pointer to a UIDBDATA structure containing
**	information for the current DBMS session.
**
**	NOTES TO USERS:
**	    1)  The pointer value returned by this routine may
**		change from call to call depending on the DBMS
**		session that is being executed.  If you know the
**		DBMS session will not switch and the current session
**		will not close, you can keep a local copy of the pointer
**		to the returned structure, but otherwise you should call
**		IIUIdbdata each time you need the information.
**
**	    2)  This routine may cause a query to be executed.
**		You MUST make sure NOT to call this routine while
**		in the middle of a query statement.  It is best
**		to call it before the query and then use the
**		returned structure in the query.
**
**	A standard example of the usage of this routine would be:
**
**		EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
**		     UIDBDATA	*uidata;
**		EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;
**
**		uidata = IIUIdbdata();
**		EXEC SQL SELECT c FROM t
**		     WHERE owner = :uidata->user;
**
** Returns:
**	{UIDBDATA *} A reference to a UIDBDATA structure containing the
**			information for the current session.  A value will
**			always be returned even if no session is active.  If no
**			session is active, the returned structure will contain
**			default values (e.g., the strings will be empty).
**
** History:
**	aug-1991 (jhw) - Whenever the call to 'IIUIssdStoreSessionData()' is
**		made through here it is for an application!  Bug #38671.  All
**		Front-Ends should connect via 'FE[n]*ingres()' or equivalent.

**
** Description:
**	This call causes UI to store needed information about the current

**
**	Note, IIUIdbdata will invoke this routine if called when no data

**
** Inputs:
**	dbname		The name of the database that is being run.
**
**	appl		If TRUE then this session is for a user's application.
**			FALSE means it is an INGRES FE that is using the
**			session.
**
**	was_xflag	This must be set to TRUE if the xflag was used
**			to start the DBMS session that has been started.
**
** Outputs
**	was_appl	This will be set to TRUE on exit if DBMS session is
**			shared (the xflag was used) and the parent is
**			a user application.   In some cases, whether the
**			parent is a user application has be guessed at.
**			In general, if this flag is set to FALSE, then
**			you can safely assume that your parent is an FE
**			program, otherwise you should assume you don't
**			know anything about how the parent connected to
**			the DBMS.
**
**	Returns:
**		A status value.  OK means that the data for the session
**		was stored and will be returned by subsequent calls to
**		IIUIdbdata when the current DBMS session is executing.
**		A failure code means that no data could be stored for
**		the current session.
**
** Side Effects:
**	This may run some queries, but it will not commit any
**	queries it runs since the caller may be the FRS when it
**	does a forminit, and we don't want to commit a user's transaction.
**	The caller needs to commit after this routine if they don't
**	want an outstanding transaction.
