/*{
** Name:    FEinMST() -	Check for Active DBMS MST.
**
** Description:
**	Check whether there is an active MST pending by attempting
**	to issue a BEGIN TRANSACTION statement.  If it fails, then
**	there must have been a MST currently in progress.
**
**	When this routine returns there will always be a MST in
**	progress (either one that had previously been issued or
**	as a result of this routine successfully issuing the
**	BEGIN TRANSACTION.)
**
** Returns:
**	{bool}  TRUE		// a MST was already pending
**		FALSE		// no MST was pending
**
** Side Effects:
**	Will start a MST if one was not already in progress.
**
** History:
**	10-86 (peterk) - created.
**	10-sep-87 (daver)
**		Initialized the static Xacterr to FALSE before starting
**		the new transaction. If no error occurs, then msterr is
**		not called; hence Xacterr may be still TRUE from a previous
**		call, leading clients of this routine to the wrong conclusion.
**	30-sep-1987 (peter)
**		Close the transaction if it is open.
**	28-oct-1987 (peter)
**		Fix bug.  If transaction NOT open, close it.
**      4-mar-1988 (danielt)
**		return TRUE against a gateway
**	13-oct-1988 (danielt)
**		changed to use new INQUIRE_INGRES interface
**	21-Aug-2009 (kschendel) 121804
**	    Update the function declarations to fix gcc 4.3 problems.
