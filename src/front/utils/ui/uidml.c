/*{
** Name:	IIUIdml() -		Return Value for Default DML.
**
** Description:
**	Returns the default value for the query language to be used by a
**	front-end product.
**
**	Two factors must be considered by this routine:
**
**	It looks at the query language(s) that the DBMS can understand, as
**	indicated by the "ii_dbcapabilities" catalog, which can be QUEL, SQL
**	or GATEWAY SQL.
**
**	It also looks at the query language(s) that the installation is
**	authorized to use, determined by a call to 'FEdml()' (which calls
**	'CIcapability()' to examine the authorization string.)  This can
**	be SQL and/or QUEL, or neither, if there were some unforseen problem
**	with the authorization routines.  Note that in the case of a foreign
**	DBMS, authorization strings may not be implemented (DG for instance).
**	In this case 'CIcapability()' will always return OK for any capability.
**
**	This function uses the following priority in determining which DML to
**	use as the default:
**
**	If both SQL and QUEL are authorized, then the DML will be chosen in
**	this order:
**
**		1) RT/SQL (if there is a DBMS capability)
**		2) QUEL (if there is a DBMS capability)
**		3) Gateway SQL
**
**	If only one language is authorized, that language will be chosen as
**	long as it is understood by the DBMS.  It is assumed that the only
**	case of this would be when an INGRES installation was authorized to be
**	SQL-only.  In this case, RT/SQL would be chosen.
**
**	When no DBMS capabilities are defined for any language, the most
**	limited DML is returned (Gateway SQL.)
**
**	NOTE:  It is assumed that 'IIUIdci_initcap()' will be called before
**	any calls to 'IIUIdml()'.  This function will NOT indicate an error
**	if there is a problem accessing the "iidbcapabilities" catalog.
**
** Returns:
**	{nat}	UI_DML_QUEL	-Quel is default language
**		UI_DML_SQL	-RT/SQL is default language
**		UI_DML_GTWSQL   -Gateway SQL is default language
**
** History:
**	01-oct-1987 (danielt)	Written.
**	08/09/87 (jhw)  Changed to use 'FEdml()'.
**	18-jun-1991 (jhw)  Clarified logic.
