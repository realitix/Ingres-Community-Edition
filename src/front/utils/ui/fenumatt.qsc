/*{
** Name:	FEnumatts -  determine the number of attributes of a relation.
**
** Description:
**	Returns the number of attributes of a relation.
**
** Inputs:
**	 relname	Name of the relation you want the attributes of.
**			This is expected to be in normalized form.
**
**	 relowner	Name of the owner of the relation you want the
**			attributes of.  This is also expected to be in
**			normalized form, and may be NULL or an empty string
**			(for pre-6.5 compatibility or when the true owner is
**			unknown or unimportant).  Note that this parameter is
**			ignored for connections to pre-6.5 databases.
**
** Returns:
**	numatts		The number of attributes of the relation.
**			If the relation doesn't exist or other DB error,
**			then returns 0.
**
** History:
**	25-jul-87 (rdesmond) written.
**	11-feb-88 (rdesmond)
**		modified to use FErel_ffetch() instead of FErel_open(),
**		FErel_fetch(), FErel_close sequence for performance.
**		Removed range statement.
**	19-aug-1988 (peter)
**		update column names for standard catalogs for 6.1.
**	30-may-1989 (danielt)
**		changed CVlower to IIUGlbo_lowerBEobject()
**		(my last bug fix)  (sob)
**	11/89 (jhw)  Modified to use aggregate for performance.
**	22-jul-1992 (rdrane)
**		Add 6.5 support for owner.tablename, delimited identifiers,
**		and synonyms.  If 6.5, can bypass call to FErel_ffetch()
**		since we don't require any of the information which is
**		returned in FE_REL_INFO.  Note the implication that both
**		the owner and tablename strings are normalized since they
**		are specified discretely.  Thus, the routine no longer
**		cases the strings.  Be paranoid and split if relname is
**		NULL or an empty string.
**	31-dec-1993 (rdrane)
**		Use OpenSQL level to determine 6.5 syntax features support.
