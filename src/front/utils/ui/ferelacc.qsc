/**
** Name:	ferelacc.qc - Relation info access a la cursor.
**
** Description:
**	Presents a generalized cursor-like implementation for access to 
**	relation info.  Since this is based on an EQUEL retrieve loop rather 
**	than a cursor, only one database access may be active at a time.
**
**	This file defines:
**	FErel_access	Allows access to a relation through OPEN, FETCH, and
**			CLOSE operations.
**
** History:
**	29-mar-1986 (rdesmond)
**		first created for Jupiter release.
**	18-jan-1988 (danielt)
**		SQLized for DG project
**	18-aug-1988 (peter)
**		Update catalog column names for 6.1.
**	10-nov-1988 (danielt)
**		took out seperate select loops based on
**		whether details are wanted.  The main concern
**		here is keeping down the number of repeated
**		queries in the DBMS shared query cache (for
**		INGRES)
**	10-oct-91 (seg)
**		Changed "errno" to "errnum" to avoid naming conflict with
**		c runtime library
**	16-jul-1992 (rdrane)
**		Add 6.5 support for owner.tablename, delimited identifiers,
**		and synonyms.
**	19-feb-1996 (pchang)
**		Add dbmsinfo('group') to the qualification of permit_user for
**		the iiaccess catalog in FErel_access() so that 'help' also 
**		displays tables for which the user has been granted access via

**	29-jan-1997 (hanch04)

/*{
** Name:	FErel_access - cursor-like access to any relation.
**
** Description:
**	This function presents a cursor-like abstraction for access relation
**	information.  It is called in one of three modes: OPEN, FETCH
**	or CLOSE.  When called in OPEN mode, a query must be specified.
**	The query parameters are relation name, param target list, param
**	address list, qualification and sort field(s).  When called in
**	OPEN mode, the first tuple is returned.  For each call in FETCH
**	mode, the next tuple is returned or, if the end of the set has been 
**	reached, a flag to that effect.  Note that the end-of-set flag
**	can be set returned from the OPEN operation.
**
** Inputs:
**	mode		The mode in which the function is to operate:
**				{MODE_OPEN | MODE_FETCH | MODE_CLOSE }
**
**	relname   	Qualification string to be used as a query restriction
**			on the namestrings returned.  Any single value string,
**			which will be compared with the relation name may be
**			The matching templates "%", "_" and "\[...\]" may
**			be used for partial match specification (backslash
**			is always the escape character).  Use "%" to indicate
**			that all names are desired.
**
**			The qualification string may not contain an owner
**			specification, and must be otherwise normalized.
**			Ignored for modes other than MODE_OPEN.
**
**	relowner	Qualification string to be used as a query restriction
**			on the owner of the namestrings returned.  Passed
**			through to FErel_access as is.  It may be NULL or an
**			empty string, but must not contain SQL wildcards
**			and must be normalized.  Ignored for pre-6.5 databases
**			and modes other than MODE_OPEN.
**
**	relsource	pointer to an allocated FE_REL_SOURCE structure in
**			which to return the results.
**
**	cats_wanted	Boolean to indicate whether catalogs should be
**			included in the active set.
**
**	status		Pointer to allocated status of query, also set before 
**			return; this field is significant only to this 
**			procedure and should not be interpreted external to it:
**				{ STATUS_CLOSED | STATUS_OPEN | STATUS_DONE }
** Outputs:
**	status		Pointer to allocated status of query, also set before 
**			return; this field is significant only to this 
**			procedure and should not be interpreted external to it:
**				{ STATUS_CLOSED | STATUS_OPEN | STATUS_DONE }
** Returns:
**	OK			successful
**	E_UI0002_EOS		no more tuples in active set
**	E_UI0001_BLOCK_CLOSED	query block is not open (from status)
**	other			dbms error
**
** History:
**	29-mar-1986 rdesmond)
**		first created for Jupiter release.
**	28-jun-1987 (danielt) changed pointer args for recursive
**		call to FErel_access from 0's to NULLs (cast to correct type)
**	08-oct-1987 (rdesmond)
**		removed call to FErel_access to close for open call.
**	02-dec-1987 (rdesmond)
**		rewrote using repeat retrieve statements.
**	05-jan-1988 (rdesmond)
**		took off @'s from IIUIuser and IIUIdba in repeat retrieves;
**		removed EQUEL range statement.
**	18-jan-1988 (danielt)
**		SQLized for DG project
**	2-mar-1988 (danielt)
**		changed IIUIuser and IIUIdba to IIUIsuser and IIUIsdba
**	18-aug-1988 (peter)
**		Update catalog names for 6.1.
**	10-oct-91 (seg)
**		Changed "errno" to "errnum" to avoid naming conflict with
**		c runtime library
**	16-jul-1992 (rdrane)
**		Add 6.5 support for owner.tablename, delimited identifiers,
**		and synonyms.  Extensively reworked the entire routine.
**		Added parameter to optionally specify owner when MODE_OPEN and
**		6.5 database.  Removed the dets_wanted parameter since it was
**		unused and the interface is changing anyway.
**		STtrmwhite() can return an empty string if all whitespace -
**		need to detect this and force the result to be one space.
**		Include mode in the SQL variables so we can get around the
**		ANSI compiler warnings.
**	23-apr-1993 (rdrane)
**		Correct 6.5 level SELECT's so that catalogs are included
**		(cats_wanted == TRUE) only if their names match the supplied
**		pattern (they were being included unconditionally).  Exclude
**		data tables (begin w/ ii but have systenm_use of 'U').  This
**		should be a temporary fix ...
**	22-jul-1993 (rdrane)
**		Effect case translation of UI_FE_CAT_ID_65 prior to use
**		for FIPS support.
**	14-oct-1993 (rdrane)
**		Correct the usage of system_use in the SELECT's so Gateways
**		that do not provide this information will still return the
**		correct list of tables.
**	15-dec-1993 (rdrane)
**		Add PUBLIC to the permit_user qualifications for iiaccess,
**      23-nov-1994 (chech02) bug#64468
**              Add escape '\' in where clause for pre-65 catalogs also.
**		since Gateways return this instead of ' ' (space) for public
**		access.  Note that SQL92 says that an authorization ID of
**		PUBLIC is not valid, and will not be confused with the
**		FIPS case-sensitive delimited ID "public".
**      10-apr-1995 (harpa06)
**		Bug #68007 - Correct the usage of system_use in the SELECT so 
**		that primary keys and references are not visible by the user.
**	19-feb-1996 (pchang)
**		Add dbmsinfo('group') to the qualification of permit_user for
**		the iiaccess catalog so that 'help' also displays tables for
**		which the user has been granted access via the user's group 
**		(B73528).
**	06-mar-1996 (harpa06)
**		Changed UI_LEVEL_65 to UI_LEVEL_66.
**      18-Jan-2010 (hanal04) Bug 124920
**              Relation access may be granted through a role. Add the
**              check for a role match to the access query.
