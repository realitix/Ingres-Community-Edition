/* File: uipartdesc.sc - Partition description for TM, XFERDB
**
** Description:
**	This file contains routines for generating and formatting a
**	partition definition.  The definition is suitable for feeding
**	back into CREATE or MODIFY as a partition WITH-clause.
**
**	The copydb / unloaddb utilities attach the partition definition
**	to a MODIFY or possibly a CREATE statement.
**
**	The terminal monitor uses the same partition definition as
**	output for a HELP TABLE on a partitioned table.
**
**	In order to work with the various callers, uipartdesc will
**	expect the caller to supply a string-print routine (given
**	a null-terminated string of any length, append the string to the
**	output stream).  Thus, this file is insulated from any and
**	all I/O requirements.
**
** History:
**	25-Jun-2004 (schka24)

/* Name: IIUIpd_PartitionDesc - Generate a partition description
**
** Description:
**	This routine generates a partition definition for a specified
**	table as text.  The definition is in the proper syntax for
**	supplying to a CREATE or MODIFY with-clause.  If the table has
**	no partitions, NOPARTITION is generated;  otherwise we generate:
**	 PARTITION = ( partition-dimension )
**	for a singly dimensioned partitioning scheme, or
**	 PARTITION = ( ( partition-dimension
**	 ) SUBPARTITION (
**	   partition-dimension
**	  ...
**	 ) )
**	for a multiply-dimensioned partitioning scheme.
**
**	A partition-dimension is:
**	rule [ON column, column]
**	followed by logical partition definitions.  For AUTOMATIC and HASH,
**	we'll generate:
**	[n] PARTITION[s] [with location=] for n un-named partitions, or
**	PARTITION name [with location=] for a named partition.  (We don't
**	attempt the n PARTITIONS (name, name, ...) syntax.)
**
**	For LIST and RANGE, we generate a PARTITION line for each logical
**	partition, in one of the following forms:
**	PARTITION [name] VALUES ( value, value, ... ) [with location=]
**	PARTITION [name] VALUES ( (valpart,valpart), ... ) [with location=]
**	PARTITION [name] VALUES oper value [with location=]
**	PARTITION [name] VALUES oper (valpart, valpart) [with location=]
**
**	The first two being LIST styles and the last two being RANGE
**	styles.  Extra parens are needed when a multicolumn value is
**	being printed.
**
**	Everything is indented by a tab except the first line.
**
**	We don't bother querying the catalogs to find out how many
**	dimensions, columns, values per partition, etc there are.
**	Thus, there's a fair amount of state to manipulate as we move
**	from query row to query row.
**
**	The caller can specify that the with location= stuff is not
**	of interest.  Figuring out LOCATION= is a significant bit of
**	extra work, so we skip it if the caller doesn't care.
**
**	No transaction control is done here.  The caller needs to do
**	commits if needed.
**
**	The caller must supply an output routine of the form:
**	    void write_string(void *cb, char *str);
**	Which writes a null-terminated string.  "cb" is any convenient
**	control block that the caller uses to keep track of things;  it's
**	passed through from the IIUIpd_PartitionDesc call.
**
** Inputs:
**	table_name		The table name
**	table_owner		The table owner
**	ndims			Number of partitioning dimensions
**	do_locations		Caller wants to see location stuff
**	write_string		Caller supplied output routine
**	write_cb		Caller supplied control block for write_string
**
** Outputs:
**	None (other than via write_string)
**
** History:
**	25-Jun-2004 (schka24)
**	    Written.

/* Name: resolve_locations - Resolve logical partition locations
**
** Description:
**	The system catalogs store location information at the physical
**	partition level.  But, when defining partitions, one specifies
**	locations at the logical partition level.  I didn't bother
**	storing the logical partition location anywhere in the catalogs,
**	and now it's time to pay the price.
**
**	The algorithm for reconstructing the logical partition locations
**	is relatively simple.  One starts at the innermost dimension
**	and works outwards, assigning locations at the lowest dimension
**	possible.
**
**	After processing all dimensions,  we look at the assignments for
**	the outermost dimension that HAS any assignments.  Any location
**	assignments in that dimension which are identical to the master
**	table location can be eliminated.
**
**	Location assignment for a given logical partition works by looking
**	at the various occurrences of the logical partition to see if
**	they are all at the same physical location.  A logical partition's
**	physical location is determined by looking at any physical partition
**	in that logical partition that has not already had its location
**	assigned logically.  (All such physical partitions must necessarily
**	be in the same location, as no lower dimension has overridden
**	location assignments.)  If all physical partitions for some
**	logical partition occurrence have had locations assigned, the
**	logical partition occurrence is irrelevant and is skipped.
**
**	This algorithm will produce a partitioning definition that
**	accurately portrays the actual state of the table (* but see below).
**	It may NOT necessarily be identical to the user's table definition,
**	simply because location assignment is non-unique.  In particular,
**	it's possible for a user to apply location= clauses which are
**	completely overridden by inner dimensions, rendering them useless.
**	There is no way we can reconstruct such pointless location= clauses
**	because there is no catalog that remembers them.
**
**	(*) FIXME FIXME
**	The above claim is true only in the absence of MODIFY t PARTITION p
**	TO REORGANIZE statements.  Explicit partition reorganization can
**	result in a partition location scheme that CANNOT be described
**	in partition definition form.  For example, consider a 2-dimensional
**	partitioning such as:
**	    (HASH ON i 2 PARTITIONS (p1,p2))
**	  SUBPARTITION (HASH ON j 2 PARTITIONS (p3, p4))
**	and then apply MODIFY t PARTITION p1.p3 TO REORGANIZE.  That
**	leaves the first physical partition in the new location and there is
**	no way to describe that.  The only reasonable thing to do is to
**	leave those physical partitions unresolved, and later on return to
**	output a bunch of MODIFY TO REORGANIZE statements (if this is
**	copydb or unloaddb).  That will have to be done eventually, but
**	I'm leaving it as a known issue for now (Jul '04).
**
**	By the way, even with all the whirling around going on here,
**	I'd still rather decipher the locations in some front-end utilities,
**	than make the back-end recompute things after a MODIFY partition
**	TO REORGANIZE...
**
** Inputs:
**	table_name		Name of the partitioned master
**	table_owner		Owner of same
**	ndims			Number of partitioning dimensions
**	loc_header		Address of LOC_HDR to be filled in
**	write_string		See caller, for error messages
**	write_cb		See caller
**
** Outputs:
**	loc_header will point to resolved location stuff via
**	loc_header.dim_array[].lp_loctns[].
**	No return status.  If an error occurs, loc_header.dim_array is
**	left NULL.  The caller can assume that error messages have
**	been issued.
