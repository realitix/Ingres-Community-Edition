/**
** Name:    ugwildcard.c
**
** Description:
**
** Defines:
**	IIUGwildcard()
**	IIUGscanwildcard()
**	IIUGewc_EscapeWildcard()
**
** History:
**  11-nov-1987 (danielt)
**		written 
**	05-jun-1992 (rdrane)
**		Redefined and re-written.  No current client actually uses the sql_wild
**		parameter, and it was only being set properly for NULL pointers and
**		empty strings.  In addition, it was unclear from the previous comments
**		if the intent was to return TRUE if it found an SQL wildcard in the
**		input string, placed an SQL wildcard in the output string, or both.
**		As a result, the sql_wild parameter is being retained for compatability
**		and future use.  It will be set to TRUE if the resultant string contains
**		SQL wildcards, regardless of their origin.
**
**		The output description now reflects that the routine simply scans
**		an input string and converts QUEL wildcards to SQL wildcards IN PLACE.
**		The scan is done via the CM routines to	ensure support for double-byte
**		characters (this was not the case previously).
**
**	19-jun-1992 (rdrane)
**		Added IIUGscanwildcard() routine (SQL only).  Besides ignoring
**		conversion of QUEL wildcards, the routine accepts specification of
**		an escape character, does not flag SQL wildcards so escaped, and does
**		flag brackets so escaped (range specification).
**
**		Changed the setting of sql_wild in IIUGwildcard() to reflect TRUE only
**		if a substitution occurred.  The previous change was to support the
**		functionality added by IIUGscanwildcard(), and it actually introduced
**		more problems than it solved (it didn't support skipping of escaped
**		wildcards, nor would it recognize a bracket range).
**	20-jul-1992
**		Added IIUGewc_EscapeWildcard() routine (SQL only).  Effect escaping
**		of SQL wildcards.

** Description:

**	sql_wild	address of boolean to receive conversion status

** Outputs:
**	pattern	    string with any QUEL wildcards converted to SQL wildcards
**	sql_wild	TRUE -	QUEL wildcards were found and SQL wildcards were
**						substituted in their place.
**				FALSE -	No substitutions occurred.  The string may or may not

**	19-jun-92 (rdrane)
**		Redefined the setting of sql_wild (again).  We no longer look for
**		SQL wildcards since they don't mean anything in the context of this
**		routine (it's a character substitution routine.  Period.).

/*
** IIUGewc_EscapeWildcard -
**
** Description:
**	Detects and escapes SQL wildcards in a string.  This permits delimited
**	identifiers to be prepared for use in pattern matching situations.
**  The string is not expected to have extraneous trailing blanks, is not
**  expected to exceed FE_MAXNAME in length, and is expected to be NULL
**  terminated.
**
**	The string is expected to be in normalized form, i.e., there are no
**	"already escaped wildcards".  Thus, '\%' is transformed into '\\\%'.
**
**	Range matches are not well behaved.  This routine will transform
**	'\[A-Z\]' into '\\[A-Z\\]'.  This may or may not be what was intended,
**	but remember that for an identifier in normalized form, there is no
**	such thing as a range match specification!
**
** Inputs:
**	in_str		Character pointer to the NULL terminated string to be
**				escaped.  Assumed to reside in a buffer of max length
**				(FE_MAXNAME + 1).
**	out_str		Character pointer to the buffer in which to place the
**				result string, which will have any SQL wildcards escaped.
**				Assumed to go into a buffer with a minimum of
**				((2 * FE_MAXNAME) + 2 + 1) available length.
**	sql_escape	character to be used as the escape character.  Note that we
**				assume that this will always be a single-byte character.
**				For use with FE routines, this should always be backslash.
**				If specified as EOS, then no escape character is defined
**				and this routine simply copies in_str to out_str.
**
** Output:
**	out_str		The escaped string representation of the input.  A NULL
**				or empty input string will be reflected as EOS.
**
** Returns:
**	Nothing.
**
** History:
**	20-jul-1992 (rdrane)
**		Created.
