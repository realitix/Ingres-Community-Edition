/*{
** Name:	CU_EXISTS - given an object class, name, and owner, check 
**			to see if it already exists in the database.
**
** Description:
**
** Input params:
**	class		OO class of the object.
**	name		object name.
**	id		pointer to id,  which is set to OOID if exists;
**			may be null if return ID is not needed.
**
** Output params:
**	id		pointer to id,  which is set to OOID if exists;
**
** Returns:
**	TRUE		if objects exists.
**	FALSE		if objects does not exist.
**
** Exceptions:
**	none
**
** Side Effects:
**
** History:
**	22-Apr-87 (rdesmond) - written.
**	3-jul-1987 (Joe)
**		Modified for copy utility.
**	2-feb-1988 (Joe)
**		Fix for BUG 1892. Applications don't follow
**		the normal ownership rules of other FE objects
**		since an application is global to the database.
**		(How could I have forgotten that?).
**		Also, make the retrieve a repeat and took out
**		the range statement.
**	05-sep-88 (kenl)
**		Changed QUEL to SQL.
**	09-nov-88 (marian)
**		Modified column names for extended catalogs to allow them
**		to work with gateways.
**	28-aug-1990 (Joe)
**	    Changed references to IIUIgdata to the UIDBDATA structure
**	    returned from IIUIdbdata().
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4

** Description:
