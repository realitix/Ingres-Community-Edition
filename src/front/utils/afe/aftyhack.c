** Name:	aftyhack.c -	Map Accepted Type Synonyms to ADF Types.
**
** Description:
**	ADF does not support all of the variants of all the various types,
**	and so, this file defines:
**
**	iiafTypeHack()	ad-hoc map of all accepted type synonyms.
**
** History:
**	Revision 6.2  89/05  wong
**	Added string type synonyms.  JupBug #6165.
**
**	Revision 6.0  87/05/01  daver
**	Initial revision.
**	21-mar-94 (smc) Bug #60829
**		Added #include header(s) required to define types passed
**		in prototyped external function calls.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4

/*
** Name:	SYNONYMS - 	Variant ADF Type Associations Map.
**
** Description:
**	The SYNONYMS table contains a mapping between the variants of the ADF
**	types that are accepted and the ADF types.  Most types are recognized
**	via ADF.  However, certain types such as some integer and float types
**	can have SQL sounding names which aren't currently recognized by ADF.
**	The "c" synonym is needed because it can contain a length immediately
**	following the type name "c" (e.g., c10) while the other string synonyms
**	stand for the string type with a length of 1.
**
**	NOTE: the entries in the SYNONYMS table MUST be arranged ALPHABETICALLY
**	      on synonym name in order for the binary search in iiafTypeHack()
**	      to work.
**
** History:
**	1-may-1987	(daver)	First Written.
**	01/04/89 (dkh) - Removed READONLY qualification to regain sharability
**				of ii_libqlib on VMS.
**	05/89 (jhw) - Added string type synonyms.  JupBug #6165.  Also,
**			ordered for binary search.
**	07-jun-1989 (wolf)
**		Synonyms on IBM must be in EBCDIC sort order for binary search.
**	20-aug-92 (davel)
**		Changed length argument to be a DB_DATA_VALUE pointer,
**		so that precision/scale could be hacked as well as length.
**		Also added definitions in the
**		synonym list for "dec", "decimal", and "numeric".
**	25-feb-93 (mohan)
**		Added tag to SYNONYMS structure.
**	12-mar-92 (fraser)
**		Changed structure tag name so that it doesn't begin with
**		underscore.
**	02-nov-1993 (mgw) Bug #55985
**		Added byte and byte varying to the synonyms table so that
**		if user enters either type without a length, it will default
**		to 1. Also added comment above about the need to keep the
**		SYNONYMS table alphabetical on synonym name in order for the
**		binary search in iiafTypeHack() to work.
**	05-May-2004 (hanje04)
**		SIR 111507 - BIGINT Support
**		To support use of 64bit tids and other BIGINTs define 8 byte 
**		integers (i8 & integer8) to synonyms table.
