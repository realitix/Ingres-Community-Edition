/*
** Explanation:
**      QUEL is not compatible with the current STAR catalogs. STAR is driven
**      entirely by SQL semantics.  The STAR portion of OPC takes the best
**      CO-tree and converts it into a QP containing SQL queries that are
**      forwarded to the DBMSs (Ingres and others) that actually own the tables
**      involved in the query.  QUEL and SQL have some differences that are not
**      easily smoothed over.
**
**      This message will be in effect until the STAR catalogs are supported by
**      QUEL.
**
** System Status:
**
** User Action:
**      The user must use SQL to perform queries on a STAR database.
