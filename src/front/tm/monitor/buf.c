/*
**  BUFPUT -- put character onto buffer
**
**	The character 'c' is put onto the buffer 'bp'.	If the buffer
**	need be extended it is.
**
** History:
**
**	8/8/85 (peb) -- Added additional routines to provide a special
**			interface for the macro package. This allows
**			us to support 8-bit characters in the macro package
**			without major surgery. The general idea is that the
**			buffer manager accepts/returns 'nat' values consisting
**			of an eight-bit character (low-order byte) and a
**			flag indicating whether the character is quoted in the
**			high order byte (or bytes). These quote characters
**			are porperly stored by the buffer manager.
**			The routine mac_bufcrunch removes all QUOTED indicators
**			from the returned string.
**	9/18/85 (peb)	Updated m_bufput to put escape sequence in proper order
**			Must be escape then character.
**	19-may-88 (bruceb)
**		Changed ME[c]alloc calls into calls on MEreqmem.
**	27-may-88 (bruceb)
**		Parenthesize arg to sizeof, so compiles on DG.
**	15-nov-91 (leighb) DeskTop Porting Change:
**		Changed 'BUFSIZE' to 'TMBUFSIZE' to avoid conflict with
**		'BUFSIZE' in compiler header.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	aug-2009 (stephenb)
**		Prototyping front-ends
