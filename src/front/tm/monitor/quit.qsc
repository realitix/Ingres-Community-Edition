**
**  QUIT INGRES
**
**	This routine starts the death of the other processes.  It
**	then prints out the logout message, and then waits for the
**	rest of the system to die.  Note, however, that no relations
**	are removed; this must be done using the PURGE command.
**
**	Uses trace flag 1
**
**	History:
**
**	3/2/79 (eric) -- Changed to close Trapfile.
**	9/10/80 (djf)	 modified for 2 process vms version.
**	08/06/84 (Mike Berrow) -- Brought over 2.1 UNIX Updates
**	08/10/85 (gb) -- Added nasty System V hack.  Was looping
**			 forever between quit-ing_cleanup-pb_prime-
**			 pb_read-mon_exhandler when the backend
**			 died abnormally.  Problem is that
**			 ing_cleanup() counts on INintrpt() failing
**			 if the backend is gone.  Unfortunately
**			 the kill() system call doesn't
**			 know the backend is gone as long as the
**			 parent is alive.  So until the SV bug is fixed,
**			 simply exit upon the second instantiation
**			 of quit().
**	86/07/14  19:11:29  perform
**		zap Mon_star_[intro,exit], handle through control string.
**	86/07/23  16:50:11  peterk
**		6.0 baseline from dragon:/40/back/rplus
**	86/10/14  15:00:41  peterk
**		working version 2.
**		eliminated BE include files.
**		added check for pending MST at \quit.
**	86/10/14  15:31:04  peterk
**		added an output message when TM is \quit with a pending MST
**		and the transaction is aborted.
**	87/03/18  16:44:42  peterk
**		removed cutesy "goodbye -- come again" message on exit.
**	87/04/10  13:02:02  peterk
**		added #include {compat,dbms,fe}.h
**	30-sep-1987 (peter)
**		Take out abort if not in a transaction.
**	25-may-88 (bruceb)
**		Changed to use SQL commit and rollback.
**      10-may-89 (Eduardo)
**              Added interface to SEP tool
**	30-sep-89 (teresal)
**		Added IBM porting change.  Made Version[] READONLY.
**      13-mar-90 (teresal)
**              Fix for bug 9141.  Only put out SQL committed msg when
**              COMMIT was sucessful.
**	14-mar-90 (teresal)
**		Put out warning if Terminal Monitor is exiting (input file EOF
**		has been reached) but there is still an open quoted string.
**	20-dec-1990 (kathryn)  Bug 34938
**		If "-s" flag was given suppress message:
**		"Your SQL statement(s) have been committed."
**	20-apr-1991 (kathryn)
**		Reset Nodayfile to Userdflag in case "\q" was executed from an
**		include() "\i" file. The Nodayfile flag gets reset by include()
**		The Userdflag is the value that the user actually specified.
**	21-apr-92 (seg)
**		"errno" is reserved by ANSI C and causes a problem on OS/2.
**	11/07/92 (dkh) - Alpha porting change.  READONLY qualifier for
**			 GLOBALREF is not supported on alpha.
**	14-sep-1995 (sweeney)
**		WECOV purge -- it seems to have been SYSV on VAX (?).
**	27-apr-1999 (mcgem01)
**		The procuct name is no longer hard-coded in the logout
**		banner.
**	07-jun-1999 (somsa01)
**		Took out above change. We now append to the banner
**		variables the product name in tmmain.qsc .
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	06-May-2005 (toumi01)
**		Return non-zero OS RC if /nocontinue and we get an error.
**	06-May-2005 (toumi01)
**		Minor change for VMS: return OK or FAIL, not arbitrary err.
**      01-May-2008 (ashco01) Bug: 120300
**              Closing the output "\script" file before writing the TM
**              exit (date/version) message caused sigsegv and subsequent
**              E_MO003C. Moved SIclose() of output script file to a point
**              following the final write. 
**	24-Aug-2009 (kschendel) 121804
**	    Need ug.h to satisfy gcc 4.3.
**	29-Sep-2009 (frima01) 122490
**	    Add return type for quit() to avoid gcc 4.3 warnings.
