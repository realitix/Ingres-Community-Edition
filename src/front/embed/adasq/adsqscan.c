/*
** Procedure:	sc_scanhost
** Purpose:	Do some crude parsing of host code. Scan host code and eat
**		host comments and host string literals while looking for 
**		a host terminator or the end of line. This routine is called
**		with two purposes:
**
**		scan_term = TRUE	Determine if the current 
**					host code line has multiple 
**					statements on a line. Host
**					code is scanned for a host
**					terminator. If one is found, this
**					routine scans to see if there
**					is another statment on the line, if
**					so, it will return TRUE and will
**					reset SC_PTR to point to the next
**					statement.
**		scan_term = FALSE	Scan until the end of the line. 
**					Don't look for a host terminator.
**					This option is used when we
**					are parsing host code in a declare
**					section and we just want to scan
**					for host comments and host strings.
**
**		This routine was written to support flexible placement of 
**		SQL statements within Ada host code. FIPS requires that
**		SQL statements can be anywhere a Ada statement can be.
**		For example, Ada statements and SQL statements can be mixed on
**		a single line, like so:
**
**			if (cond1 = 1) then EXEC SQL COMMIT;
**			elsif (cond1 = 2) then EXEC SQL ROLLBACK;
**			else EXEC SQL INSERT INTO t1 
**						VALUES ('test');
**
**		Or multiple SQL statements can be on one line:
**
**			EXEC FRS FORMS; EXEC SQL ROLLBACK;
**
** Parameters:
**	scan_term 	TRUE	Scan for a host terminator, if found, 
**				reset SC_PTR if another statement follows.
**			FALSE	Scan till EOL, eat host comments and strings. 
**
** Return Values:
**	bool  TRUE 	Found another statement on this line. SC_PTR is 
**			reset to point to the next statement.
**	      FALSE	This host line does not need to be split up. Only
**			found one Ada statement or we were just scanning
**			for comments and strings.
** Notes:
**	Called from the ESQL scanner.
**	Resets SC_PTR
**
**	Host Language Constructs
**	======================== 
**	Ada string delimitor is the double quote
**	Ada terminator is the semicolon: ;
**		However, in Ada, new statements can also follow the
**			following Ada keywords:
**				then
**				else
**				loop
**				begin
**				do
**				=>
**
**		Thus, this routine treats the above Ada keywords as 
**		terminators. If one of the above keywords is found in
**		host code, it is treated like a terminator, 
**		and the line is scanned to look for another statement.
**	
**		Ada statements are allowed in the following places:
**		
**		1. After the terminator:
**			statement; {statement;}
**		2. Within Ada Compound Statements
**		   a. If Statement:
**			if condition then statement; {statement;}
**			elsif condition then statement; {statement;}
**			else statement; {statement;}
**			end if;
**		   b. Case Statement:
**			case expression is
**				when choice => statement; {statement;}
**				when choice => statement; {statement;}
**				when others => statement; {statement;}
**				end case;
**		   c. Loop Statement:
**			loop statement; {statement;}
**			end loop;
**		   d. Block Statement:
**			blockname:
**				begin statement; {statement;}
**			end blockname;
**		   e. Accept Statement
**			accept entry_name do statement; {statement;}
**			end;
**
** History:
**	11-feb-1993	(teresal)
**			Written to support flexible placement of SQL 
**			statements within Ada host code as required by 
**			FIPS.
