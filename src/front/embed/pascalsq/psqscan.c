**		sc_scanhost()			- Scan host code: N/A for PASCAL
**		sc_eatcomment()			- Eat host commt: N/A for PASCAL
**		sc_inhostsc()			- N/A for PASCAL

**		16-feb-93	As part of flexible placement of SQL
**                              statements changes, added sc_scanhost(),

**                              placement of SQL statements, these
