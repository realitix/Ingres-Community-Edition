**
**  Description: 
**        UNSUPPORTED IN Ingres65 - Hence unexpected !

**      rmid       - RMI identifier, assigned by the TP system, unique to the AS
**                   process w/which LIBQXA is linked in.
**      flags      - TP system-specified flags, one of

**  Outputs:
**	Returns:
**          XA_RETRY       - TMNOWAIT was set in flags, no asynch ops completed.
