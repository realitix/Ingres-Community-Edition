/**
** Name:	erco.msg -	Message file for class CO
**
** Description:
**	This file defines the messages for class CO.  The result is
**	erco.h which is used to compile the iicopy.c program, and
**	s184.mnx which is used at run time by IIlocerr().
**
**	To generate erco.h and s184.mnx, issue the following VMS commands:
**
**	ercomp :== $disk$develop3:[jupiter.vtools.r.bin]ercompile.exe
**	ercomp -t erco.msg
**	copy s184.mnx disk$develop3:[jupiter.front.frontcl.rplus.files.english]
**	copy s184.mnx disk$develop2:[jupiter.ingres.files.english]
**
** History:
**	 4-sep-1987 (barbara)
**		Created.
**	20-sep-87 (puree)
**		Modified to fit the iicopy.c on VMS.
**	03-dec-90 (teresal) 
**		Added new error message for bug fix 32562.
**	08-oct-90 (teresal)
**		Modified error message E_CO0015 for bug fix 20335.
**	13-dec-90 (teresal)
**		Added new error message for bug fix 34405.
**	26-dec-90 (teresal)
**		Added new error message for bug fix 6936.
**	02-apr-91 (barbara)
**		Added error message E_CO0040_END_OF_DATA for COPY FROM PROGRAM.
**	31-oct-92 (larrym)
**		Added SQLSTATES to errors.  
**	15-mar-93 (mgw)
**		Added E_CO0041_FILE_WRITE_MSG_ERR for Large Object COPY.
**	08-apr-1993 (mgw)
**		Added E_CO0042_BLOB_READ_ERR, E_CO0043_BLOB_SEG_READ_ERR,
**		and a number of Slow messages for tailoring these and the
**		E_CO0041_FILE_WRITE_MSG_ERR msgs. I changed the parameter
**		list for E_CO0041_FILE_WRITE_MSG_ERR, a no-no under normal
**		circumstances, but OK since this error msg hasn't been
**		released to users yet.
**	19-oct-96 (mcgem01)
**		All references to MISC_ERRORS changed to MISC_ERRORS
**		for the Jasmine/Ingres code sharing project.
**      21-oct-98 (wanya01)
**              X-integrate change 436382
**              Added E_CO0048_ALLDUPS_OR_DISKFULL to indicate that 0 rows
**              were copied because either all rows were duplicates or there
**              was a disk full problem. This change fixes bug 90968.
**	20-jan-2004 (somsa01)
**		Added E_CO0049_PROG_WRITE_MSG_ERR, E_CO004A_PROG_READ_MSG_ERR.
**	8-Dec-2009 (kschendel) SIR 122974
