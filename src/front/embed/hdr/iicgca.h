+*  Name: iicgca.h - Header file for Client to GCA interface.
**
**  Description:
**	This file defines the structures and definitions for a front-end
-*  	interface to GCA (General Communications - Applications utility).
**	It is be included with <gca.h>.
**
**  Notes:
**	The GCA tracing information is included in this file.  Most of
**	the structures and constants should be moved into gca.h and
**	its internal files when the tracing utility is moved into
** 	GCA itself.  The structure types are prefixed with GCA_ rather
**	than the IICGC_ prefix for future updates.
**
**  History:
**	08-sep-1986	- Written for 6.0 front-ends (ncg)
**	15-jul-1987	- Rewritten for GCA. (ncg)
**	09-may-1988	- Modified to support DB procedures. (ncg)
**	16-sep-1988	- Added all the tracing information. (ncg)
**	24-may-1989	- Added field to CGC_DESC to keep track of number
**			  of connections. (bjb)
**	16-aug-1989	- Added GCA_ROWCOUNT_INIT define to aid LIBQ
**			  in setting transaction info. (bjb)

/*}
+*  Name: IICGC_MSG - Client's header for GCA message buffer.
**
**  Description:
**	This is the client header for the GCA message buffer.  The header
**	includes only data block counters and pointers and no semantic
**	information such as message types or modifiers.  The actual buffers
**	themselves are allocated at startup time. 
**
**	A buffer includes a message header (only known by GCA), and a
**	client/server data area.  
**
**	Also included is the GCA parameter list argument.  These are
**	explicitly non-static and maintained inside this structure so as
**	to handle "double operations", such as reading an IACK while waiting
**	to read other data with an interrupt handler.
**
**	There is also a special "interrupt" GCA parameter argument.  This is
**	there so that we do not use the same GCA_PARM to send queries as we
**	do to send interrupts.  If we did, we could run into the following
**	situation:
**	    Send a query (GCA_SEND does not complete)
**	    .... interrupt arrives before GCA_SEND completes ...
**	    Send an interrupt (GCA_SEND for interrupt completes, but when
**		done GCA marks all outstanding GCA_SEND's as "purged" inside
**		their GCA_PARM).
**	    On return from GCA_SEND of the interrupt, we find that it looks
**	    like the "interrupt" was purged!  This is because the GCA_PARM
**	    for sending both the interrupt and the regular query are the same.
**	This can also happen for GCA_RECEIVE which may be waiting on a read
**	when an interrupt is hit.  It may be possible to get data that was
**	just about to be deposited into the result buffer, but with the "purge"
**	status set.
**	Large Objects: 05-oct-1992 (kathryn)
**          Large Objects are witten to the message buffer as an ADP_PERIPHERAL
**          followed by any number of segment strings, followed by the 
**	    null_byte when nullable.  A segment string consists of an integer 
**	    (1 = more segments, 0 = no more segments) followed by an
**          i2 whose value contains the length of the next data segment, then
**          followed by the actual data segment.
**          One Large object would be transmitted as follows:
**              ADP_PERIPHERAL,
**              1, cgc_seg_len, data_segment, 1, cgc_seg_len, data_segment ...
**              0, null_byte (if nullable).
**          Note that the "," is not part of the message, it is used here
**          only for readability.
**		
-*
**  History:
**	15-jul-1987	- Written (ncg)
**	09-oct-1987	- Added GCA_PARMLIST arguments (ncg)
**	05-oct-1992  (kathryn)
**	    Added cgc_seg_len and cgc_seg_used for use with large objects.
**	    These fields are used only when transmitting a large object.
**	    cgc_seg_len is the length in bytes of the current data segment 
**	    being transmitted.  cgc_seg_used is the number of bytes of the
**	    current data segment that has been read/written in the cgc_buffer.
**	01-nov-1992  (kathryn)
**	    Added cgc_more_segs - indicates whether or not there are more
**	    segements of a large object in GCA buffer.  This value is part of
**	    the segment string as described above.
**	23-apr-1993 (kathryn)
**	    Change cgc_more_segs from i4 to nat.

**  Name: IICGC_DESC - Client descriptor area for GCA communications interface.
**
**  Description:
**	The client GCA communications data structures are hidden from the 
**	callers (in LIBQ) via this descriptor.  This descriptor is allocated
**	and filled on session startup, and is always passed in with calls
**	to IIcgc routines.
**
**	This structure is split into 4 groups:
**	1. The "general" group consists of global message information, such as
**	   masks indicating what is going on.
**	2. The "writing" group contains any information required while writing
**	   data to the server.  There are one message buffer for writing
**	   data and a the query-text buffer for buffering query text as it
**	   comes in.  This query buffer is maintained so as not to have little
**	   pieces of queries mixed with binary values.  Note that this DOES
**	   require the copying of the query buffer into the data buffer when
**	   full.  This group also keeps track of the current message type.
**	3. The block "reading" group is made up of one result block, a 
**	   response, procedure return structure, and alternate buffer.
**	4. The last group is "miscellaneous" and contains I/NET descriptor
**	   information and utility handlers to call on various conditions.
**
**  History:
**	14-aug-1986	- Written for Jupiter FE-BE communications. (ncg)
**	14-jul-1987	- Modified for GCA. (ncg)
**	04-may-1988	- Added cgc_retproc for database procedures and
**			  added descriptor information for I/NET. (ncg)
**	01-sep-1988	- Added cgc_savestate for faster startup of
**			  spawned processes. (ncg)
**	16-sep-1988	- Added cgc_trace for tracing GCA. (ncg)
**	18-apr-1989	- Added state flag to describe whether association
**			  is heterogeneous. (bjb)
**	23-apr-1990	- Added cgc_alternate for cursor performance
**			  project. (ncg)
**	15-jun-1990 (barbara)
**	    Added state flag for failed association (FASSOC_MASK) so that
**	    disconnect doesn't attempt to send GCA_RELEASE. (bug 21832)
**	01-nov-1991 (kathryn) 
**	    Add defines used as cgc_debug() parameters for PRINTQRY handling.
**	    IIDBG_INIT - New query - re-initialize query trace buffer.
**          IIDBG_ADD  - Add text strings to current query trace buffer.
**          IIDBG_END  - Sending query to DBMS - print query trace to file.
