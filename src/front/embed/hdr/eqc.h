+*  Name: C_VALS - Maintains C symbol table value field.
**
**  Description:
**	This structure takes care of obscure C-type symbol table requirements.
**	1. When a variable is declared as a function, the the cv_flags are
**	   set, otherwise they are reset.
**	2. When a dimensioned buffer is used the dimension string is stored
**	   as a null terminated string in the bogus array.  This dimension
**	   is used for code generation in order to attempt to keep buffer
**	   limits at run-time (became a problem when we upped the size of our
**	   catalog fields).
-*
**  History:
**	20-mar-1987	- Written for 6.0 conversion. (ncg)
**	01-nov-1992	- Added define for RETVAR for GET_DATA stmt. (kathryn)
**	01-oct-1993 (kathryn)
**	    Added define for G_PUT.
