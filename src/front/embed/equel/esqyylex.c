+* Filename:	esqyylex.c
** Purpose:	Interface between grammar and scanner through YY defined 
**		routines and variables for YACC -- ESQL version.
**
** Defines:	yyesqlex()	   - Scanner called by YACC (yyparse by yylex).
**		sc_moresql()       - Called by slave grammar to indicate
**				     we just finished parsing an SQL statement,
**				     but we need to check for SQL comments.
**		sc_execstmt	   - Scan for EXEC SQL|FRS|4GL
** Locals:
**		sc_esqishost( mode ) - What kind of a line is this?
** Uses:
**		yylval		   - Yacc stack element filled by scanner.
-*		yydebug		   - Yacc debug flag.
**
** History:	11-Dec-1984	   - Rewritten (mrw)
** 		20-Aug-1985	   - Modified to allow calling from ESQL (mrw)
** 		19-May-1986	   - Modified to fake FORTRAN terminators (bjb)
**		19-May-1987	   - Modified for Kanji/new scanner design (mrw)
**		29-jun-87 (bab)	Code cleanup.
**		03-May-1988	   - Scan in raw/rare/cooked mode (whc)
**		02-aug-1989	   - Flag FRS statements for FIPS-compat. (bjb)
**		29-Aug-1989	   - Modified for COBOL sequence no. (teresal)	
**              29-may-1992 (kevinm) B43426
**                      Check to see if *SC_PTR is not equal to SC_EOFCH in a
**                      do/while loop for call sc_readline.
**		28-jul-1992	   - Added global sc_hostvar; this is set
**				     by the slave grammer when it sees a 
**				     host variable reference.  sc_word was 
**				     modified to check for this global and 
**				     to supress keyword lookups. (larrym)
**	02-oct-1992 (larrym)
**		Added new global, sc_saveptr.  If we're currently scanning a 
**		host variable reference (i.e., not doing keyword lookups), 
**		then the current SC_PTR is saved here before calling sc_word.  
**		If the slave grammer determines that the last word should have 
**		been scanned with keyword lookups enabled, then it will 
**		enable them, and call sc_popscptr, which I have also just 
**		added.  sc_popscptr will move SC_PTR back to the previously
**		saved address.  This will allow the word to be rescanned with
**		keyword lookups on.  For more details on this, look in any
**		slave grammer file under HOST VARIABLE USAGE.
**	20-nov-1992 (Mike S)
**		Check for EXEC 4GL as well as EXEC SQL and EXEC FRS
**	09-feb-1993 (teresal)
**		Add flexible placement of SQL statements within a host 
**		language. You can now mix SQL statements and host
**		language statements on a single line. This support
**		is only for ESQL/ADA and ESQL/C.
**	10-jun-1993 (kathryn)
**		Add flexible placement of SQL stmts for ESQL/FORTRAN for FIPS.
**		sc_scanhost() will now return TRUE in Fortran, when an SQL stmt
**	        appears on the same line as a Fortran "logical if" stmt.
**		EX:  if (x .eq. 0) exec sql commit  (only place allowed).
**		Since only one executable stmt is allowed in a Fortran 
**		"logical If" stmt, and we generate multiple stmts from one
**		SQL stmt, we must generate a "block if" fortran stmt. 
**		When sc_scanhost returns TRUE, add keyword "then" to the
**	        sc_hostbuf. eq_flags will be set to EQ_ENDIF so that at
**		the end of processing the SQL stmt we will generate "end if".
**		Added new routine sc_execstmt() to check for embedded stmts.
**	21-jun-1993 (lan)
**		Fixed a NIST bug where COBOL identifiers that begin with
**		digits were not allowed.
**	26-jul-1993 (lan)
**		Removed a check where an error was generated for EXEC 4GL
**		in non-C languages.  EXEC 4GL is now supported in all the
**		other languages.
**	22-Jun-1995 (walro03/mosjo01)
**		Added NO_OPTIM dg8_us5.
**		Symptom: loop in esql.
**		Works in DG/UX 3.00 MU05; fails in DG/UX 3.10 MU02.
**      12-Dec-95 (fanra01)
**              Added definitions for extracting data for DLLs on windows NT
**      06-Feb-96 (fanra01)
**              Made data extraction generic.
**	15-mar-1996 (thoda04)
**		Added include eqgen.h for prototype for out_emit().
**		Corrected parameter type for local sc_esqishost().
**		Added function parm prototype for sc_numname().
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	4-oct-01 (inkdo01)
**	    define yyreswd for parser reserved word retry logic.
**	23-oct-2001 (somsa01)
**	    Moved define of yyreswd to eqdata.c.
**	07-Nov-05 (toumi01) SIR 115505
**	    Support hex constants in format 0x696E67636F7270 as well as the
**	    traditional X'6279656279654341' to aid application portability.
**	24-Mar-2007 (toumi01)
**	    Add support for multi-threaded Ada.
**	27-Apr-2007 (toumi01)
**	    Logically delete TASK BODY Ada scanning for now.

/*
** sc_popscptr - Move SC_PTR back one word.  
**
**	This function is called from the slave grammers when it is determined
**	that a word needs to be rescanned with keyword lookups enabled.
**
**	Parameters:
**		None
**
**	Returns:
**		None
**
**	Assumptions:
**		This function assumes that a non-null sc_saveptr points to a 
**		valid address within the scanner buffer.
**
**	Side effects:
**		Two globals, SC_PTR and sc_saveptr, are modified by this 
**		routine.
**
**	Notes:
**		Here are the comments from the slave grammer on why this 
**		function is needed:
** -----
** Now we allow the use of reserved words as host variables.  The way we do
** this is set a global (sc_hostvar) to TRUE when we see a Ccolon (or a
** Csqlda_colon).  The global tells scword (in the scanner) to ignore keyword
** lookups and just returne a tNAME.  We turn it off when we're at the end
** of the hostvar reference.  There's a problem, however, in that sometimes
** the grammer doesn't know to turn the global off until after we've scanned
** a real keyword.  For instance, in the statement:
**      EXEC SQL CONNECT :connect SESSION :session;
** by the time the grammer turns off the global for :connect we've already
** scanned SESSION, and it has been returned as a tNAME instead of tSESSION.
** what we do here is to introduce a new rule that allows a hostvar to be a
** variable or a variable followed by a tNAME.  In either case, we turn off
** the sc_hostvar global.  Additionally if we see a variable followed by a
** tNAME we call a new function, sc_popscptr, which sets up the scanner to
** rescan the word with keyword lookups enabled.  So in our example above
** SESSION will get "scanned" twice, once as a tNAME and then as tSESSION.
** the same thing is done for sqlda variables.
