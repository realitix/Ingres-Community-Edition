/*
+* Filename:	SCINCLUDE.C
** Purpose:	Routines to process Equel 'include' lines.
**
** Defines:	inc_tst_include()	- Test if this is an include line.
**		inc_push_file()		- Include the file.
**		inc_is_nested()		- Are there open include files.
**		inc_pop_file()		- Pop current include file.
**		inc_dump()		- Dump information about include files.
**		inc_parse_name()	- Parse a file name for SQL.
**		inc_inline()		- Force a file to be INLINE. (ESQLA)
**		(*inc_pass2)()		- Entry point to pass 2 EQUEL's (EQP).
**		inc_save()		- Save original parent location.
**		inc_add_inc_dir()	- Add an include ("-h") directory.
** Locals:
**		inc_fileparse()		- Parse a file name into pieces.
**		inc_expand_include()	- Expand included filenames
-*		inc_isdir()		- Is a location a directory?
** Notes:
**  1. Because we support regular and inline inclusion of files, both the
**     routines that open and close the include files must know if the files
**     were inline included or not.
**  2. If we preprocess the same file twice, we do not open the second time
**     for writing - just reading.  We require that INC_INLINE and INC_NOWRITE
**     be mutually exclusive; INLINE overrides NOWRITE and always produces
**     output.
**  3. ADA vs non-ADA - ADA has some problems because it does not have an
**     include facility.  Consequently the following rules are followed:
**
**				           non-ADA		ADA
**			     	       +----------------+---------------
** ## INCLUDE 			       | host_include   | WITH package
** ## INCLUDE INLINE 		       | inline include | inline include
** SQL INCLUDE not in DECLARE SECTION  | host_include   | WITH package
** SQL INCLUDE in DECLARE SECTION      | host_include   | inline include
**
**  4. We support global includes, using <> delimiters.  In eqc and esqlc
**     with the "-c" flag we generate global includes, using <> delimiters.
**     This is the normal case for RT internal code.  If the porting group
**     wishes to run the preprocessor on a master machine and then ship the
**     generated ".c" files to the target machines for compilation, then we
**     don't want to generate #include lines with a full pathname as the real
**     path on the target machine is likely to be different.  On the other
**     hand, we can't just generate <filename.ext>, because only the C
**     compiler supports the "-I" or an equivalent.  The compromise we chose
**     is:
**	  if (language is C) and ("-c" flag specified) then
**	    generate: #include <filename.ext>
**   	  else
**	    generate: #include "full-path-name.ext"
**
**  5. The "-o" flag with no suffix means that we should never generate output
**     for include files.
**
**  6. See cgen.c for a special workaround for double preprocessed files
**     whereby eqc when used with the "-c" and "-o.sh" flags will generate
**     an "exec sql include filename" after seeing ## include filename.
**     (filename may be be a global filename or otherwise.)
**
**  7. We support relative path to local include files. 
**     (global include files are discussed in no. 4 above).
**     We assume that all local include files ("local.qh") reside in the same
**     path as the file that included it. 
**     EXAMPLE:
**     		Assume command was:  ESQLC dir1/main.sc
**     		If main.sc contains "EXEC SQL INCLUDE 'dir2/foo' and
**	  	    foo.sc contains "EXEC SQL INCLUDE 'dir3/foo2'
**	   Include			Generate	
**	   -------			--------
**	  "dir1/dir2/foo.c"          include 'dir2/foo.c'  (in dir1/main.c)
**     "dir1/dir2/dir3/foo2.c"       include 'dir3/foo2.c' (in dir1/dir2/foo.c)
**
** History:
**	10-nov-1984	Rewritten. (mrw)
**	15-apr-1985	Added logical names and no rewriting of same file. (ncg)
**	17-jan-1986	ESQL extensions are like the main extensions. (ncg)
**	01-mar-1986	Added hooks for EQUEL/ADA and ESQL/ADA. See note (ncg)
**	01-dec-1986	Added support for global includes, from code by jhw
**			on 05-feb-1986. (mrw)
**	13-jul-1987 	Changed memory allocation to use [FM]Ereqmem. (bab)
**	15-sep-1988	Added inc_save for inc_fileparse changes and
**			remote include file processing. (ncg)
**	16-nov-1988	Added MVS code to handle data set inclusion. (emerson)
**	11-jan-1989	Added CMS ifdefs again. (wolf)
**	26-jan-1990	Copy buffers because LOfroms is now more strict (bjb)
**	11-jun-92 (seng/fredb)
**			Integrate dcarter's 02-feb-1990 change from 6202p:
**      		   02-feb-1990     Added HP3000 ifdef (hp9_mpe),
**					   which causes output include file
**					   name to be formed correctly
**					   (dcarter)
**	16-Oct-92 (fredb) hp9_mpe
**			Eliminate some of the relative path code for
**			MPE/iX because we don't have relative paths and
**			the resulting filename is seriously hosed.
**	12-Nov-1993 (tad/smc)
**		Bug #56449
**		Replace %x with %p for pointer values where necessary.
**	21-nov-1994 (andyw)
**	    Solaris 2.4/Compiler 3.00 port failed in front!abf!copyapp
**	    then trying to compile caout.sc; this file make an 
**	    EXEC SQL INCLUDE <oodep.h> which is overwritten when
**	    the grammer calls inc_push_file(), this opens for read
**	    then opens for write (no append specified, therefore file
**	    is re-generated). Change to inc_push_file() from write to read
**
**	04-Jan-95 (carly01)
**		Bug 65935
**		Bug fixed on 21-nov-1994 (andyw) was actually caused by 
**		multiple mkmings being done (thus causing the MING file
**		to include multiple references to caout.c, caerror.c, and
**		insrcs.c).  The compile of caout was being done with the
**		erroneous MING file.  This fix restored the open for output:
**		EQ_SI_OPEN_LANG(..., ERx("w"), &ofile).  The MING file was
**		also restored to its correct form (by tutto01).
**      18-jan-1994 (harpa06)
**              Bug #65006
**              When specifying an absolute path to a source file on the
**              command line, and specifying a relative path in the
**              source file using "../" notation, ESQLC would try to look at an
**              invalid directory structure. For example:
**
**              filename: /tmp/esqlc/src/test.sc has
**                      EXEC SQL    INCLUDE "../inc/test.h";
**
**              test.h is located in /tmp/esqlc/inc
**
**              and you specify from the command line:
**                      esqlc /tmp/esqlc/src/test.sc
**
**               from the src directory, ESQLC would look for the file:
**                      /tmp/esqlc/src../inc/test.h
**
**              It now looks for: /tmp/esqlc/src/../inc/test.h
**      12-Dec-95 (fanra01)
**          Added definitions for extracting data for DLLs on windows NT
**	18-mar-1996 (thoda04)
**	    Added #include eqgen.h for out_xxxxx functions.
**	    Added #include eqsym.h for eqgen.h.
**	    Corrected cast of MEreqmem()'s tag_id (1st parm).
**	    Moved inc_add_inc_dir() out of list of locals; it called by eqmain.c.
**	    Defined function prototypes for local functions.
**  29-may-1996 (angusm)
**		Change logic in inc_push_file() so that output of EXEC SQL
**		INCLUDE file in relative path is also in relative path.
**		(bug 76327).
**	24-sep-1996 (kch)
**		In inc_push_file(), added check for null remote path before
**		constructing remote output filename. This change fixes bugs
**		78639, 78423 and 76036.
**	28-jan-1997 (kch)
**		In inc_fileparse(), we now only add a "/" to the remote path
**		if it is not NULL. This change fixes bug 78423 (and not the
**		change described above).

/*
+* Procedure:	inc_push_file
** Purpose:	Change I/O files for a file inclusion after ## include.

**
** Parameters:	None - there is one static parameter with file information.
-* Returns:	None
** Assumptions:
**	- static variable inc_tfile has the parsed file name to which to switch.
**	- called by grammar after yylex() returns TOK_INCLUDE (just after
**	  inc_tst_include() returned SC_INCLUDE) or from yylex()
**	  when inc_tst_include() returns SC_INLINE.
** History:
**      03-nov-1988 - For MVS, make all includes expand inline. (emerson)
**      21-nov-1994 (andyw)
**          Solaris 2.4/Compiler 3.00 port failed in front!abf!copyapp
**          then trying to compile caout.sc; this file make an 
**          EXEC SQL INCLUDE <oodep.h> which is overwritten when
**          the grammer calls inc_push_file(), this opens for read
**          then opens for write (no append specified, therefore file
**          is re-generated). Change to inc_push_file() from write to read
**	29-may-1996 (angusm)
**		Ensure that we open output file in relative path for
**		preprocessed EXEC SQL INCLUDE file in relative path.
**		(bug 76327).
**	24-sep-1996 (kch)
**		Added check for null remote path before constructing remote
**		output filename and now call LOcompose() with the second
**		argument set to NULL rather than rpath if (*rpath == '\0').
**		This prevents a forward slash ('/') being added to the filename
**		during the call to LOcompose(). A nested include will be marked
**		as being remote, even though it may be in the same directory as
**		the includer. This change fixes bugs 78639, 78423 and 76036.
