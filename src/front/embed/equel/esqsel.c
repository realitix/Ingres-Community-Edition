/**
+*  Name: esqselect.c - Bulk/Singleton SELECT/RETRIEVE utility buffer routines.
**
**  Description:
**	The Data General Gateway needs to know if a SELECT is Bulk or
**	Singleton; it distinguishes between the two by inspecting a bit
**	in the initial control block, which we must set.
**	As the two kinds of statements are differentiated only by the
**	presence or absence of a BEGIN/END block following the statement,
**	we must buffer the output until we know which kind it is (ie, until
**	after the statement proper has been parsed).  Note that the flag bit
**	is set in IIqry_start, which will be called by the first IIwritio.
**	We force the SINGLETON bit to be set by calling IIsqMods(IImodSINGLE);
**	the default is that this is a bulk select.
**
**	There are four cases:
**	    1. RETRIEVE
**	    2. REPEAT RETRIEVE
**	    3. SELECT
**	    4. REPEAT SELECT
**
**	1, 2. In EQUEL, retrieves are ALWAYS Bulk retrieves, as the semantics
**	    of RETRIEVE are that we always generate a loop and retrieve all
**	    the rows, even if the user didn't explicitly specify a loop.
**	    (In which case s/he will end up with the last row -- this will be
**	    documented soon).  If the user wants only the first row then s/he
**	    must explicitly code a loop and include an ENDRETRIEVE statement.
**	    As BULK is the default, EQUEL does not need to buffer its output
**	    and thus never calls this code.  Whether or not the query is
**	    repeated is immaterial.
**
**	4.  No current gateways support REPEAT queries, DG has no
**	    corresponding notion, and it's not at all clear what meaning
**	    a repeat query has for a foreign backend, nor what a gateway
**	    should do with such a creature.  Therefore we are NOT supporting
**	    repeat queries for gateways at this time.
**
**	    The INGRES backend doesn't need to know the difference between
**	    Singleton and Bulk SELECTs, whether or not they are repeated.
**	    The semantics of the two are different, so currently the
**	    preprocessor generates code differently for the two cases.
**	    As REPEATED queries already buffer their output we don't want
**	    to introduce more buffering in here unnecessarily (although it
**	    should work; see the cursor code -- eqcursor.c), so REPEAT SELECTs
**	    will continue to generate the current code and avoid this module.
**
**	    If REPEATED SELECT ever needs to be supported for gateways then
**	    we will deal the problem then.  If there's any justice in the
**	    world, by then we'll be building parse trees or something, and
**	    won't have to worry about buffering output.
**
**	3.  Thus the only case we need to deal with is non-repeated SELECTs.
**	    As the default is BULK SELECT we will call IIsqMods only for the
**	    singleton case (although we'll have to go through this module
**	    to buffer the query until we find out which kind of select it is).
**
**  Defines:
**	esl_query( flag )		- Start/stop/end buffering a query
**	esl_clean()			- Clean up after syntax error
**  (Local)
**	esl_buffer( ch )		- Buffer a character

** Description:
**	- If "init == ESL_START_QUERY", then allocate a new string table,
