/*
+* Procedure:	symRsPL1
** Purpose:	Resolve a stack of entries to a symtab entry.
** Parameters:
**	result	- SYM **	- Will be set to resolved entry.
**	closure	- i4		- The closure of this reference.
**	use	- i4		- The sy_flag bits.
** Return Values:
**	i4
**	  syL_OK:	success; result has been set.
**	  syL_NO_NAMES:	no field names given; result is NULL.
**	  syL_BAD_REF:	NULL component pointer; result is set to last resolved
**			component (NULL if none).
**	  syL_NOT_FOUND:bad variable reference; result is set to last resolved
**			component (NULL if none).
**	  syL_AMBIG:	ambiguous reference; result is set to first name found.
-*	  syL_RECURSIVE:recursive data reference; never occurs.
** Notes:
**	- Given a stacked list of sym_tab entry pointers A0 ... An,
**	  return a pointer to an entry for A0 such that
**	  A0 in A1 in ... in Am, m >= n, represents a fully qualified
**	  structure reference.
**	  If more than one such A0 is satisfied report an error and return
**	  the first one found.  If none found report an error and return NULL.
**	- If the syFisREVERSE bit is set in "use" then this is PL/1
**	  and the names are stacked in the order:
**		lowest level number	    (bottom)
**			.			|
**			.			|  -- stack growth direction
**			.			v
**		highest level number	      (top)
**	  and we must walk the stack "backwards" (top to bottom).
**	  Remember that high level numbers indicate the most deeply nested
**	  children.
**	- Actually, this self-same code can be used for COBOL if you
**	  just set the visibility stuff appropriately.
**	- ALGORITHM:
**	  For each entry with the same name as A0:
**	    Foreach Ai:
**		Walk up the parent list Ai looking for Ai+1.
**		If out of parents w/o getting to An then try another A0
**		If got to An then this is a successful parent tree;
**		there are three cases:
**		    1.	The new one was defined deeper than the old;
**		    2.	The new one was defined at the same level;
**		    3.	The new one was defined shallower.
**		Case (1) can't happen.  Case (2) is ambiguous, but if one
**		was a top-level reference then it wins (can't be two top-level
**		in the same block).  Case (3) returns the old one and stops.
**
** Imports modified:
**	None.
