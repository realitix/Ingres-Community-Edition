+* Filename:	sycopy.c
** Purpose:	Tree copying routines (for PL/1)
**
** Defines:
**	sym_copy	- copy a symbol table tree (recursive - internal only)
-*	sym_graft	- Driver for sym_copy (called from outside)
** Notes:
**
** History:
**	11-Nov-84	- Initial version (mrw)
**	29-jun-87 (bab)	Code cleanup.
**	15-sep-93 (sandyd)
**		Fixed type mismatch on MEcopy() arguments.
**	25-oct-93 (sandyd)
**		Standard says we should cast "sizeof()" when used as argument.

/*
+* Procedure:	sym_copy
** Purpose:	Copy a tree, returning a pointer to the head of the copy.
** Parameters:
**	node	- SYM *	- Tree to copy
**	reclev	- i4	- Level at which to root it
** Return Values:
-*	SYM *	- Pointer to the head of the copy.
** Notes:
**	- use a postorder traversal.
**	- adjust the child and sibling (and parent) pointers appropriately.
**	- adjust the record level too.
**	- insert each copied entry at the head of its hash chain.
**	- we WILL be guaranteed that the source tree is not recursive!
**	- WARNING: the parent pointers of the copy of the top of the tree
**	  ("node" and its siblings) will point to the original parent,
**	  not to the adoptive parent; the new parent needs to adopt them
**	  formally.
**
** Imports modified:
**	Nothing.
