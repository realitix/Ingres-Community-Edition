/**
+*  Name:	bassqscan.c - BASIC dependent ESQL scanner routines.
**  Purpose:	Language-dependent lexical utilities.
**
**  Defines:
**	Bsq_continue()			Is current line to be continued?
**	sc_newline()			Is current line a continuation line?
**	sc_iscomment			Is current line a BASIC comment line?
**	sc_label()			Scan and save line num/label
**	sc_skipmargin()			Skip margin on a declaration
**	scStrIsCont()			Is current line a string continuation?
**	sc_scanhost()			Scan host code - N/A for Basic
**	sc_eatcomment()			Eat host comment - N/A for Basic
**	sc_inhostsc()			Host string or comment? - N/A for Basic
**
**  Notes:
**	This file is based on the template esqsclang.c.
**	The modifications reflect the BASIC syntax and format rules
**	that we follow in scanning embedded statements.
**
**	ESQL/BASIC has no statement terminators.  This has
**	necessitated several special workarounds in the scanner
**	and grammar as follows:
**
**	1.  Fake terminators on most EXEC statements.
**	    Since the G grammar expects terminators at the end of
**	    embedded statements, we have faked a statement terminator
**	    token in the scanner.  In general, if we're in DML_EXEC
**	    mode and we've seen a newline, we send back a terminator
**	    token if the next line is NOT a continuation line.
**	
**	2.  No fake terminators on host declarations.
**	    The grammar rules for declarations do not require terminators.  
**	    When the scanner is in DML_DECL mode no terminator token will be 
**	    sent. Note, however, that line continuation is allowed for 
**	    declarations.
**
**	3.  No fake terminators on EXEC SQL DECLARE TABLE statements.
**	    Since the DECLARE TABLE rule is completely handled in
**	    the L grammar, terminators are not required.  No
**	    terminator token will be generated because the grammar
**	    turns DML_DECL mode back on when it has reduced the
**	    whole statement.
**
**	4.  No fake terminators on EXEC SQL INCLUDE statements.
**	    For INCLUDE statements within a declaration section, the 
**	    L grammar does not require a terminator.  However, the
**	    INCLUDE statement in G DOES require a terminator.  The 
**	    scanner cannot use the fake terminator mechanism on 
**	    INCLUDE statements, however, because it must be in sync 
**	    with the grammar before the include file is scanned.  The 
**	    solution is to make a special rule "host_inc_term" to be 
**	    used instead of "host_term" on include statements.  
**	    "host_inc_term gets defined in all L grammars.  In BASIC 
**	    it's a null rule.

**  History:
**	05-jan-1986	- written (bjb)
**	16-jul-1987	- updated for 6.0 (bjb)
**	15-jan-1989	- fixed bug #4456 (bjb)
**			Repeated line number bug where we generated duplicate
**			line numbers when a statement with optional last 
**			part has optional part omitted.  Caused by look-
**			ahead mechanism in parser causing calling sequence
**			lex_isempty -> sc_iscomment -> Bsq_lnum.  The last
**			routine will zap line number of current statement as
**			it looks ahead.  Fix in sc_continue() is 
**			1) if last line was NOT continued, we are not
**			'within' an embedded statement -- return FALSE
**			without calling Bsq_lnum()
**			2) if last line was continued, don't look for a linenum.
**			A line number on a BASIC continued line is illegal.
**	16-feb-1993	As part of flexible placement of SQL statements
**			changes, added sc_scanhost(), sc_eatcomment(), and
**			sc_inhostsc() routines to this file. Note: 
**			since Basic doesn't support flexible placement of
**			SQL statements, these routines are no-ops.
**	26-feb-1993 (lan)
**		Fixed bug 49739 where Basic line continuation was not working.
**      08-30-93 (huffman)
**              add <st.h>
**      14-may-1996 (thoda04)
**              Define sc_skipmargin() as returning nat, the same as all the
**              other languages, so that the function prototype will not flag it.
**	15-feb-2001	(kinte01)
**	    Bug 103393 - removed nat, longnat, u_nat, & u_longnat
**	    from VMS CL as the use is no longer allowed

/*{
+*  Name: Bsq_continue - Check if the current line is being continued.
**
**  Description:
**	A BASIC line is marked as being continued if it ends with
**	a '&\n'.  This routine is called from sc_operator (via
**	the function pointer sc_linecont()) when a "&" is encountered.  
**	It checks to see if the operator '&' is followed by a newline, 
**	indicating a continued line.  If so, a static flag (bas_continued)
**	is set.  Sc_newline (called from the scanner on newlines in EXEC
**	mode) will check this flag in order to tell the scanner whether 
**	the next line is continued.  In DECL mode, the scanner "ignores"
**	continued lines; however, the bas_continued flag must be reset
**	and this is done is sc_skipmargin().
**
**  Inputs:
**	None
**
**  Outputs:
**	Returns	
**	    1	The current line is being continued
**	    0	This line is not being continued

**  Side Effects:

**
**  Description:
**	This function is called (via function pointer dml->dm_iscomment) from 
**	lex_isempty() in the scanner.  It is called to check for host 
**	comments within SQL statements.  
**	For BASIC the comment indicator is (! or REM).  A line number and/or
**	label may be present at the beginning of a comment line and the 
**	comment may immediately follow without any intervening white space.  If
**	there is no line number, there should be at least one space at the 
**	beginning of the line, but we don't actually check for that.
**	Note that although we check for a BASIC line number/label, the grammar 
**	will not be emitting line numbers or labels because the comment lines 
**	within statements are not emitted.
**
**  Inputs:

**	Skipping the margin in a BASIC program means scanning an optional
