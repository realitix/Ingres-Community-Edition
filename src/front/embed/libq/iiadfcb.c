** Name: iiadfcb.c - Set up multiple ADF control blocks for LIBQ
**
** Description:
**	This is an LIBQ specific interface to the FEadfcb routine to allow
**	multiple ADF control blocks to be created. FEadfcb only allows
**	one ADF CB. This routine will setup an ADF control block for
**	the current database session if an ADF CB does not already exist.
**
**	Multiple ADF control blocks are required for LIBQ so that each
**	multiple session will have it's own ADF control block. When a 
**	connection is done, command flags such as '-f', '-i' are stored
**	in the FE ADF control block. Each session needs to store which
**	ADF command flags were given for a database connection;
**	otherwise, subsequent connections will lose any ADF command flags
**	specified. Also, multiple ADF control blocks are required because
**	at connection time, the protocol level is stored in the ADF CB.
**	This protocol level is used to determine if decimal is supported.
**	Multiple ADF CBs are needed for decimal interoperability to work
**	for multiple sessions.
**
** This file defines:
**
**	IILQasAdfcbSetup	- Setup an ADF control block for a session
**				  if one has not been set up yet.

**
** Description:
**	Setup an ADF Control block.
**
**	Multiple sessions are stored as a linked list of session control 
**	blocks. However, there always exists a default session block.
**	A static ADF control block is set up for the default session
**	block while ADF control blocks for each session in the link list
**	are dynamically allocated. There must always be a static ADF 
**	control block setup before a dynamic ADF CB can be allocated. The
**	static ADF CB is setup using the FEadfcb() routine which initializes 
**	all default values for the ADF CB. When allocating a dynamic ADF CB
**	for a session, the default values are copied from the static ADF CB.
**
** Inputs:
**	thr_cb		Thread-local-storage control block.
**
** Outputs:
**	None.
**
** Returns:
**	STATUS
**	 	OK 	- ADF Control Block was succesfully allocated.
**		FAIL 	- Failed to allocate an ADF Control Block.
**
** Side Effects:
**	Allocates an ADF control block for the current session (or
**	for the default saved session) if one does not exist.
