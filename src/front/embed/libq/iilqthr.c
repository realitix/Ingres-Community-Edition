/*
**  Name: iilqthr.c
**
**  Description:
**	Routines to support multi-threading and thread-local-storage.
**
**  Defines:
**	IILQthThread()	- Get control block for current thread.
**	IIsqlca()	- Get SQLCA for current thread.
**
**  History
**	18-Dec-97 (gordy)
**	    Added support for multi-threaded applications.
**	08-jan-98 (mcgem01)
**	    Make sqlca a GLOBALREF rather than an extern.
**	24-mar-1999 (somsa01)
**	    Don't reset ii_gl_seterr to IIret_err() unless it is not
**	    defined. Also, filled in missing comments.
**	16-feb-2001 (kinte01)
**	    For VMS don't declare IISQLCA as GLOBALDEF.  From comment
**	    header in iisqlca.c - VMS Note: Even on VMS where GLOBALDEF 
**	    is the rule for declarations, we do not use the GLOBALDEF 
**	    storage class, as we must make this visible to user's "extern" 
**	    reference (who do not go through the compat.h which redefines 
**	    that class to globalref).  In fact, the ESQL/C preprocessors on 
**	    VMS, running under the compatlib (with the -c flag) make sure 
**	    that the SQLCA is extern and not globalref.
**      23-March-2007 (Ralph Loen) SIR 118032
**          Added II_sqlca() for compatibility with case-insensitive
**          languages.
**	10-Jun-2008 (lunbr01)  bug b120432
**	    Moved ck of II_VCH_COMPRESS_ON variable here to do once
**	    at initialization rather than for each query, which was
**	    bad for performance.

/*
** Name: IILQthThread
**
** Description:
**	Returns the thread-local-storage control block for the
**	current thread.  Global initialization occurs on the
**	first call to this routine.  The thread-local-storage
**	control block is allocated on the first call to this
**	routine by each thread.
**
**	Each thread is assigned a unique SQLCA. For backward
**	compatibility with single-threaded systems, the first
**	thread is assigned the global SQLCA.  Each subsequent
**	thread is assigned a thread-local-storage SQLCA.
**
**	If any error occurs (shouldn't happen), an error message
**	is displayed and the current process is terminated.

** Input:
**	None.

** Output:
**	None.
