** Name: iilqevt.c - Process events for access by applications.
**
** Description:
**	This module contains the routines to read events arriving
**	from the DBMS, to save a description of those events in an
**	internal list, and to return information about the latest
**	event to the user application via the INQUIRE_SQL statement.
**
**	At the present time only synchronous event processing is
**	supported, i.e. the user application must poll via the
**	GET DBEVENT statement to get an event or the user application can 
**	code an event handler or an FRS event activation block.
**	Example statements andthe generated code are shown below:
**
**	EXEC SQL GET DBEVENT
**	generates:
**		IILQesEvStat(0, 0);
**
**	EXEC SQL GET DBEVENT WITH WAIT = 4;
**	generates:
**		IILQesEvStat(0, 4);
**
** Defines:
**	IILQesEvStat	- Get and consume the event. 
**	IILQeaEvAdd 	- Read event and print and/or add to list.
**	IILQedEvDisplay - Display event information to stdout.
**	IILQefEvFree	- Free the first consumed event on the list (if any).
**
** History:
**	03-nov-1989	(barbara)
**	    Written for Phoenix/Alerters.
**	07-may-1990	(barbara)
**	    Don't add/process events if disconnecting.
**	25-may-1990	(barbara)
**	    Cleaned up formating of displayed events.
**	15-may-1990	(barbara)
**	    When processing GET EVENT call IIqry_start for some basic
**	    error checking, such as are we connected?
**	18-apr-1991	(teresal)
**	    Made major modifications to eliminate GET EVENT ability
**	    to retrieve event information - this functionality has been
**	    replaced with INQUIRE_SQL.  GET EVENT now just polls for and 
**	    consumes the event (if found). Added concept of "consuming" an event
**	    which means the event has been polled for and has been put on the
**	    top of the list.  An consumed event will remain on the
**	    top of the list so the user can inquire on it until the next event 
**	    is polled for.
**	20-jul-1991	(teresal)
**	    Change EVENT to DBEVENT.
**	02-01-1992 (kathryn)
**	    Terminal Monitor now registers a dbevent handler.  Only display 
**	    event information for II_G_TM flag when an event handler has not 
**	    been registered.
**	21-mar-94 (smc) Bug #60829
**		Added #include header(s) required to define types passed
**		in prototyped external function calls.
**	18-Dec-97 (gordy)

/*{
** Name: IILQesEvStat - Get event information/clean up afterwards. 
**
** Description:
**	This routine is called when an application issues the GET
**	DBEVENT statement or when a user defined event handler is called.  
**	See the module header for an example of the GET DBEVENT statement 
**	and the generated code. 
**
**	This routine checks the II_EVENT list and returns if it is non-empty.
**	Otherwise, it attempts to read an event from GCA, telling 
**	LIBQGCA to block on this read according to the value of the WAIT 
**	clause in the GET DBEVENT statement.
**
**	An event cannot be read from GCA if the application is currently
**	executing a query, e.g. in a SELECT loop or a dbproc message
**	handler or a DBEVENTHANDLER.  Therefore, if the wait parameter is
**	non-zero, an error is raised (really a warning) and no read is
**	attempted.
**
**	Getting an event is not a query to the dbms so IIqry_start
**	is called only for some error checking such as "are we
**	connected?".  IILQesEvStat does not set the INQRY
**	flag because in theory, nothing can interrupt the GET DBEVENT
**	statement, not even the DBEVENTHANDLER.
**
**	Since the GET DBEVENT statement is not a query and does not read
**	a response block, IIqry_end is not called.  Instead, this routine
**	performs one task of IIqry_end and that is to set the ii_lq_dml
**	back to QUEL.  It is assumed that outer scopes (eg SELECT loops,
**	handler entry points) will save and restore their version of the
**	dml and the SQLCA pointer.
**
**	Note that the II_EVENT list may be empty.
**
**	1) When called with the 'escall' flag set to 0 it is being
**	   called from a user application.
**
**	2) When called with the 'escall' flag set to 1 it does not 
**         reset the dml and does not call query start - this is because
**	   the function is being called internally by LIBQ, i.e., before 
**	   the user defined event handler is called.
**
** Input:
**	escall		Flag to indicate who called this routine:
**			-1: function is being called by LIBQ to consume 
**			    the event before a user defined event
**			    handler is called.
**			 0: function is being called by a GET DBEVENT 
**			    statement in the application.
**			 1: function is called by the WHENEVER DBEVENT code
**			    generated in the user's application.
**	eswait		Number of seconds that LIBQGCA must block on
**			reading event.  A value of -1 means to wait forever.
** Outputs:
**	None.
**	Returns:
**	    VOID
**
**	Errors:
**	    E_LQ00C7_EVWAIT - The WAIT option is not valid when GET DBEVENT
**			      is nested within another query.
**	    E_LQ002A_NODB   - Not connected when getting event.
**
** Side Effects:
**	-  If an event is read from GCA, a new event will be inserted
**	   into LIBQ's list of II_EVENTS
**	-  If an error happens in reading event (e.g. an error in
**	   IIcgc_event_read or a user error in specifying the WAIT clause),
**	   the II_EV_GETERR flag is set which will cause the event to not
**	   be added to the list.  Note that timing out when reading an event is 
**	   NOT an error.
**
** History:
**	1-nov-89 (barbara)
**	    Written for Phoenix/Alerters
**	15-jun-1990 (barbara)
**	    When fixing bug 21832, which involved more error checking, I
**	    decided to make this routine call IIqry_start instead of
**	    duplicating more code in here.  IIqry_start will return
**	    after error checking if the type is GCA_EVENT.  
**	15-mar-1991 (kathryn)
**	    Issue error if "get event with wait" is issued from any user 
**	    defined handler.
**	19-apr-1991 (teresal)
**	    Major modification to have this routine only be
**	    called once and to consume the event.

/*{
** Name: IILQeaEvAdd - Read an event and print and/or add to LIBQ's event list
**
** Description:
**	This routine calls LIBQGCA to read the values and data associated
**	with an EVENT that has been received from the DBMS.  It saves the
**	information in a list element and attaches that event to LIBQ's
**	list of events.  It is called via a handler from LIBQGCA when a
**	GCA_EVENT message has been detected.  To prevent itself from
**	being called recursively on a GCA_EVENT message which spans block
**	boundaries, this routine sets a LIBQGCA flag IICGC_PROCEVENT_MASK
**	before reading data and resets this flag when through.
**
**	Ignoring block boundaries, an event message is layed out with
**	the following format:
**
**	    typedef struct {
**		GCA_NAME	event_name;
**		GCA_NAME	event_owner;
**		GCA_NAME	event_db;
**		GCA_DATA_VALUE	event_time;	  A date value
**		i4		event_data_count  No. of data values following
**	    [
**		GGA_DATA_VALUE  event_data[1];
**	    ]
**
**	If the terminal monitor is running or if the application has
**	requested (via SET_INGRES or II_EMBED_SET) to print event
**	information, the information will be printed to the screen
**	in a format similar to TRACE messages.  If not running as the
**	TM, IILQeaEvAdd allocates an IIEVENT structure and reads the
**	event name, owner name, database name, timestamp information
**	into II_EVENT.  If data is present, space for this is allocated,
**	the data is copied and the ii_etext field in the II_EVENT is set
**	to point at the data.
**
**	Note that it is currrently an error if: 
**	    1.  there is more than one GCA_DATA_VALUE for event data;
**	    2.  the gca_type field for data is anything other than DB_VCH_TYPE.
**
**	This restriction will be relaxed in future releases.
**
**	The II_EVENT is inserted at the end of the II_EVENT list.
**	The event queue is a FIFO list so when the user asks for an
**	event, he gets the first event in the list.  Once the event is polled for,
**	the event is considered to be consumed; an event is polled 
**	for as follows:
**	    1.  After being accessed by the application with the GET EVENT
**		statement;
**	    2.  During WHENEVER DBEVENT CALL SQLPRINT error handling;
**	    3.  A user defined event handler is called.
**	    4.  At disconnect time.
**	Once an event has been consumed it will continue to be on the 
**	event list until we poll for the next event at which time the 
**	previous event will be freed.
**
**      This routine calls the user DBEVENTHANDLER, if any, after adding the 
**      event to the queue.   Note that it does not call the handler
**	if the EVENT is being read in response to a GET DBEVENT statement.
**
** Inputs:
**	thr_cb		Thread-local-storage control block.
** Outputs:
**	None
**	Errors:
**	    E_LQ00C5_EVALLOC - Unable to allocate memory for event handling.
**	    E_LQ00C6_EVPROTOCOL - Read protocol failure in event handling.
** Side Effects:
**	None
**
** History:
**	1-nov-89 (barbara)
**	    Written for Phoenix/Alerters	
**	07-may-1990 (barbara)
**	    Don't add/process events if disconnecting.
**	15-mar-1991 (kathryn)
**	    Call user defined event handler if one was set.
**	01-apr-1991 (kathryn)
**	    Push and Pop session ids around user handlers to check that user
**	    has not switched sessions in handler without switching back.
**	22-apr-1991 (teresal)
**	    Changed event handler to always consume the event.
**	02-01-1992 (kathryn)
**	    Terminal Monitor now reigsters a database event handler.

/*{
** Name - IILQedEvDisplay - Display event information to stdout.
**
** Description:
**	This routine is called to display all the information associated
**	with an event to the standard output.  It is called at the
**	following times:
**	1) after a GCA_EVENT message event has been read from GCA
**	   and either of the following is true:
**	   - the TM is running or
**	   - the program has set DBEVENTDISPLAY through II_EMBED_SET or
**		SET_INGRES.
**	2) if a 3GL program has issued the following statement:
**	    EXEC SQL WHENEVER DBEVENT CALL SQLPRINT;
**	   In this case, we are called by IIsqPrint.
**
** Inputs:
**	IIlbqcb		Current session control block.
**	event		Pointer to an II_EVENT structure containing event info.
**			(Should never be null)
**
** Outputs:
**	None.
**	Returns:
**	VOID.
**
** Side Effects:
**	The event information is displayed to stdout.
**
** History:
**	21-nov-1989	(barbara)
**	    Written for Phoenix/Alerters.
**	25-may-1990	(barbara)
**	    Cleaned up formatting display of events.
**	09-dec-1992 	(teresal)
**	    Modified ADF control block reference to be session specific
**	    instead of global (part of decimal changes).
