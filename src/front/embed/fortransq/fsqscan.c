+*  Name: sc_cont - Return true if line is a valid FORTRAN continuation line.
**
**  Description:
**	VMS:  Check for line continuation in ANSI format and VMS Tab format.
**	      VMS tab format continuation consists of an initial tab
**	      followed by a non-zero digit.  Note that an initial tab
**	      may be preceded by up to five spaces.
**	      ANSI format continuation consists of any character
**	      except zero or space in column 6.
**	Unix: 
**	      A continuation line is 1) a line with an ampersand (&) in the
**	      first position or 2) a line containing any char except blank
**	      or zero in column 6 (strictly speaking, columns 1-5 should be
**	      blank but we'll let the compiler flag errors).
**
**  Inputs:
**	cp		- (Indirect) pointer to place to start scanning.
**
**  Outputs:
**	cp 		- Will be incremented if this is a continuation line.
**	Returns:
**	    TRUE	- This is a continuation line 
**	    FALSE	- This is not a continuation line.

** Procedure:   sc_scanhost
** Purpose:     Do some crude parsing of host code to support flexible
**              placement of SQL code in Host code.
**
**	This routine parses host code to determine whether or not an SQL stmt
**	is on a line that begins with host code.  In the case of Fortran, this
**	will only occur in a logical IF stmt. (IF (x .eq. y) EXEC SQL ...)
**	The scanner parses files a line at a time.  This routine must parse 
**	a logical stmt, which may be split up in any fashion with 
**	continuation lines and comments.  
**		IF (x .eq. 'this(
**      C This is a comment
**	     &is a string)'
**	     &  )
**           & EXEC SQL ....
**
**	This routine keeps several statics that tell us where in the line we 
**	are. (Have we seen the "IF", are we in a host string, etc..)
**
**	1) If this is not a continuation line check for keyword "IF" and
**	   set in_hostif appropriately.
**      2) If this is a continuation line, and in_hostif is set then continue
**	   to parse the line for SQL statement.
**	We parse continuation lines until we have seen the outermost set of 
**	parens.  If anything other than white space or an  SQL stmt follows 
**	the parens we return false and reset the "in_hostif" variable to
**	FALSE.
**
**	Since only one executable stmt is allowed in a Fortran logical IF
**	stmt, and SQL stmts may generate several host language calls, when a
**	an SQL stmt appears in a "logical IF", we must generate a "block IF"
**	stmt.  This consists of adding the fortran keyword "then" before we
**	generate any code and an "ENDIF" after we have parsed and generated 
**	the code for the SQL stmt.  
**
**	When this routine finds an SQL stmt in a Fortran logical IF stmt, it
**	will return TRUE to yyesqlex which will add the the keyword "then"
**	to the host buffer and generate the line. This routine will update 
**	SC_PTR so that the next stmt processed will be the SQL stmt, and will
**	set a flag to indicate that an "END IF" should be generated after the
**      completion of this SQL stmt.
**
** Parameters:
**      N/A
**
** Return Values:
**	      TRUE	This line contains an SQL stmt and in logical IF.
**            FALSE     This is not a logical IF that contains SQL stmts.
