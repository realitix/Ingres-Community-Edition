/**
+*  Name: forsqtoks.c - FORTRAN/SQL token tables.
**
**  Description:
**	Defines the token tables.
**
**  Defines:
**	None.
**
**  Notes:
**	Don't run ercheck on this, and don't ERx() the strings --
**	they all implicitly are ERx()ed.
-*
**  History:
**	26-aug-1987	- Commented (mrw)
**	04-sep-1990 (kathryn)
**		Removed /* = VMS */ front tok_keytab for the following tokens:
**		[ byte, record, structure, map ] as structures are now 
**		supported on SUN F77.
**      30-jul-1992	 - split tok_keytab into tok_keytab and tok_skeytab.
**                        tok_keytab is for master (or EXEC mode) keywords,
**                        and tok_skeytab is for slave (or DECL mode) keywords.
**                        This change was to facilitate usage of reserved
**                        words in host identifiers.  Some words are duplicated
**                        in both tables.  Both tables are still "merged" with
**                        the "mgram" tokens file.  The scanner now checks
**                        dml->dm_exec to determine the table againts which to
**                        match; IT IS IMPORTANT that you be in the correct
**                        mode.  If you start getting syntax errors on your
**                        reserved words, this is the first place at which to
**                        look. (larrym)
**	22-Jun-1999 (andbr08)
**		Added the union token so that the fortran union/structure declaration
**		is parsed correctly.
