+* Filename:	cobsqcan.c
** Purpose:	Cobol-dependent lexical utilities for ESQL/COBOL
**
** Defines:
**	sc_iscomment		- Is this line a comment?
**	sc_newline		- Process end of line
**	sc_label		- Return pointer after label, if any
**	sc_skipmargin		- Skip margin of new line
**	scStrIsCont		- Is line a string continuation?
**	sc_isblank		- Is this line blank?
**	sc_scanhost		- Scan host code: N/A for COBOL
**	sc_eatcomment		- Eat host comment: N/A for COBOL
**	sc_inhostsc		- Host string or comment? N/A for COBOL
**
** History:
**	11-oct-85	- bjb (wrote based on esqsclang.c template)
**	21-aug-89	- teresal (added scan for COBOL sequence numbers to
**			           sc_label, sc_newline, and sc_iscomment)
**	20-nov-89 	- neil (allowed MF COBOL comments to be in col 1 even
**			 	though ANSI format).  Fixed a problem that
**				skipped over tabs and found source.
**	16-feb-1993	- teresal (As part of flexible placement of SQL 
**				   statements changes, added sc_scanhost(), 
**				   sc_eatcomment(), and sc_inhostsc() 
**				   routines to this file. Note: since 
**				   ESQL/COBOL doesn't support flexible 
**				   placement of SQL statements, these 
**				   routines are no-ops.)
**	21-jun-1993 (lan)
**		Fixed a NIST bug where '"' was not recognized as a quote
**		character on a continued string literal.  Fix is in scStrIsCont.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	15-dec-2004 (wanfr01)
**	    Bug 113804, INGSRV3137
**	    removed extra parameter on sc_iscomment call 
**	    compile fails on HP itanium.
**	24-Dec-2004 (shaha03)
**	    SIR #113754 Removed parameter in calling sc_iscomment(), 
**	    to keep the ansi-c compiler happy. 
**	26-Aug-2009 (kschendel) b121804
**	    Things called from the dml-state dispatch must be i4, not bool.

+* Procedure:	sc_iscomment
** Purpose:	Determine if a line is a comment line
** Parameters:
**	None.
** Return Values:
-*	bool	- TRUE iff the line is a comment line.
** Notes:
**	- Just scan through the line.
**	- For card format, comment indicator will be in col 7; we allow spaces
**	  and asterisks in sequence area (cols 1 thru 6).  Asterisks are allowed
**	  so that programs can have comment lines acceptable to both formats.
**	- Allow comments in column 1 even in ANSI format.
**	- For terminal format, indicator will be in col 1.
**	- This routine not only checks for comment indicator ("*"), but also 
**	  for new listing page("\") and conditional compilator indicator("D"), 
**	  because these are treated like comment lines by esql preprocessor.
**	- Stop when seeing a tab to avoid assuming source code is a [debug]
**	  comment as in column 7 on the 2nd line of the following example:
**		EXEC SQL DECLARE c CURSOR FOR SELECT * FROM t
**	   <tab><tab>FOR DIRECT UPDATE OF ...
**	                 ^
