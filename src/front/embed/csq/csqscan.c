/*
** Procedure:	sc_scanhost
** Purpose:	Do some crude parsing of host code. Scan host code and eat
**		host comments and host string literals while looking for 
**		a host terminator or the end of line. This routine is called
**		with two purposes:
**
**		scan_term = TRUE	Determine if the current 
**					host code line has multiple 
**					statements on a line. Host
**					code is scanned for a host
**					terminator. If one is found, this
**					routine scans to see if there
**					is another statment on the line, if
**					so, it will return TRUE and will
**					reset SC_PTR to point to the next
**					statement.
**		scan_term = FALSE	Scan until the end of the line. 
**					Don't look for a host terminator.
**					This option is used when we
**					are parsing host code in a declare
**					section and we just want to scan
**					for host comments and host strings.
**
**		This routine was written to support flexible placement of 
**		SQL statements within C host code. FIPS requires that
**		SQL statements can be anywhere a C statement can be.
**		For example, C statements and SQL statements can be mixed on
**		a single line, like so:
**
**			printf("hi;there"); EXEC SQL COMMIT; printf("hi");
**
**			switch(answer)
**			{
**				case 'Y': EXEC SQL COMMIT;
**				case 'N': EXEC SQL ROLLBACK;
**			}		
**
**		Or multiple SQL statements can be on one line:
**
**			EXEC FRS FORMS; EXEC SQL ROLLBACK;
**
** Parameters:
**	scan_term 	TRUE	Scan for a host terminator, if found, 
**				reset SC_PTR if another statement follows.
**			FALSE	Scan till EOL, eat host comments and strings. 
**
** Return Values:
**	bool  TRUE 	Found another statement on this line. SC_PTR is 
**			reset to point to the next statement.
**	      FALSE	This host line does not need to be split up. Only
**			found one C statement or we were just scanning
**			for comments and strings.
** Notes:
**	Called from the ESQL scanner.
**	Resets SC_PTR
**
**	Host Language Constructs
**	======================== 
**	C string delimitor is the double quote
**	C terminator is the semicolon: ;
**		However, in C, new statments can also follow the 
**		following C keywords/operators:
**			{
**			)
**			:
**			do
**			else
**		Thus, this routine treats the above C keywords/operators
**		as terminators. If one of the above characters/words is 
**		found in host code, it is treated like a terminator,
**		and the line is scanned to look for another statement.
**
**		C statements are allowed in the following places:
**
**		1. After the semicolon terminator:
**			statement; statement;
**		2. In a C compound statement or block of statements:
**			{ statement1; statement 2; }
**		3. Do statement:
**			do statement; while (expression);
**		4. While statement
**			while (expression) statement;
**		5. For statement
**			for (expression; expression; expression) statement;
**		6. If statement
**			if (expression) statement;
**			else if (expression) statement;
**			else statement;
**		7. Switch statement
**			switch (expression) {
**				case value1 : statement; statement; ...
**				case valuen : statement; statement; ...
**				default: statement; statement; ...
**			}
**
** History:
**	11-feb-1993	(teresal)
**			Written to support flexible placement of SQL 
**			statements within C host code as required by 
**			FIPS.

** Procedure:	sc_eatcomment
** Purpose:	Determine if we have a host comment; if so,

**		C comments within host code will be generated to the

**		are not.
**
** Parameters:
**	char **cp	Pointer to input string. 
**	bool eatall	Eat past the newline?
**			TRUE - eat the entire comment even if it spans
**			       lines. This is set to TRUE after we 
**			       have just parsed an SQL statement.
**			FALSE - Just parse up to the newline.

** Notes:
**	This routine will scan the current line for comments.
**	If the comment is continued over multiple lines, this routine
