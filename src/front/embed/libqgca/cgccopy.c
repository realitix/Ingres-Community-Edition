**
**  Defines:
**
**	IIcgcp1_write_ack - 	 Send acknowledgement to server (GCA_ACK).
**	IIcgcp2_write_response - Send response message to server (GCA_RESPONSE).
**	IIcgcp3_write_data - 	 Set up buffers for sending COPY data.
**	IIcgcp4_write_read_poll- Poll GCA for pending reads.
**	IIcgcp5_read_data - 	 Read COPY data from GCA till response.

**
**  Description:
**	This routine is used by COPY to set up the buffers for writing.  It is

**	In order for COPY to avoid looking inside the cgc message buffers this
**	routine returns the data pointers and counters of the message buffers.
**
**	This is called in a loop to send COPY tuples, for example:
**
**	    ... client reads COPY map ...
**	    IIcgcp1_write_ack(cgc, &ack);
**
**	    IIcgc_init_msg(cgc, GCA_CDATA, DB_NOLANG, 0);
**	    ... set up COPY buffers to fill ...
**	    stat = IIcgcp3_write_data(cgc, FALSE, 0, &copy_dbv);
**	
**	    terminate = FALSE;
**	    do
**	    {
**		process COPY data from file into copy_dbv.db_data and
**		keep track of the number of bytes used (<= copy_dbv.db_length);
**
**		... send COPY buffers and reset pointers and counters ...
**	        stat = IIcgcp3_write_data(cgc, end_of_tuples,
**					  bytes_used, &copy_dbv);
**
**		... every few tuples check state ...
**		if (IIcgcp4_write_read_poll(cgc, GCA_CDATA) != GCA_CONTINUE)
**			terminate = TRUE;
**
**	    } while (there's more COPY data in file and !terminate);
**
**	    if (!terminate)
**		IIcgcp2_write_response(cgc, &resp);
**	
**	Note that the above logic allows the COPY module to send more than
**	one copy data message (much like tuple data returning from the DBMS).
**
**  Inputs:
**	cgc		- Client general communications descriptor.
**	end_of_data	- End of data indicator.
**	bytes_used	- Number of bytes used in the data area.  If this is
**			  the first time (when buffer pointers are being set
**		 	  up) then this should be 0.  Otherwise, this should
**			  indicate how many bytes were actually put into the
**			  data area, copy_dbv.
**	copy_dbv	- Pointer to DBV with copy data and length information.
**			  If bytes_used is 0 then this argument is ONLY used
**			  for output.
**	    .db_data	- Pointer to start of data area as set by this call on
**			  output.  The caller should not modify this value.
**			  The number of bytes pointed at is in 'bytes_used'.
**	
**  Outputs:
**	copy_dbv	- Pointer to DBV with message buffer data and length
**			  information.
**	    .db_data	- Pointer to start of data area.  Will be set to the
**			  write message data area.
**	    .db_length	- The number of bytes available within the data area.
**			  On subsequent calls, the caller must make sure that:
**			    bytes_used <= copy_dbv.db_length.
**
**	Returns:
**	    	STATUS 	- OK if sent successfully via GCA_SEND, FAIL otherwise.

/*{
+*  Name: IIcgcp4_write_read_poll - During COPY writing poll for reads.
**
**  Description:
**	This routine is used by COPY during COPY FROM (from a file to the
**	database).  Because there may be many rows in the file and we are
**	not reading responses every few rows, there must be a way for the server
**	to interrupt the COPY process.  This is done via "polling" GCA every
**	few COPY tuples sent, to see if there is any pending data to read.
**
**	(This could have been done by GCA interrupting us via a handler, and
**	we could just mark that status.  Then, during the COPY FROM loop we
**	could check the status, and if set we would call this routine - which
**	would not poll anymore but know to read.)
**
**	If there is no data to read from the server we return "continue".
**
**	If there is anything we expect it to be an "interrupt" message. We
**	will reply with an "acknowledge" message and then read zero or
**	more "error" messages from the server (note that we have switched roles
**	and are now reading messages).  Following the last error we expect a
**	"response" message.  The status field is set to "continue" if this
**	error is not COPY-fatal.  If the return status is not "continue"
**	that means the server wants the COPY to be terminated, and in this
**	case NOTHING should be sent to the server following this call.
**
**	The message type of the surrounding control is passed as well, because
**	if we do have to acknowledge an interrupt we must re-initialize the
**	COPY message buffer for which we need the message type. 
**
**	See the example of IIcgcp3_write_data for usage of this routine.
**	
**  Inputs:
**	cgc		- Client general communications descriptor.
**	message_type	- Message type of surrounding control.  This is used in
**			  case we switch roles, and must implicitly reset the
**			  write message buffers.
**	
**  Outputs:
**	Returns:
**	    	The status value of the GCA_RESPONSE gca_rqstatus field:
**		GCA_CONTINUE_MASK - Continue sending COPY data.
**		Other		  - Stop now.

+*  Name: IIcgcp5_read_data - Read COPY data and handle errors and responses.
**
**  Description:
**	This routine is used by COPY to set up the buffers for reading.  It is
**	called in a loop during COPY INTO (from the database to a file).  This
**	routine reads and processes:
**
**	1. GCA_ERROR messages sent from the server.  Passes them to the
**	   standard error handler.  The COPY handler is not informed that an
**	   error was read.  The GCA_ERROR messages (and possibly GCA_TRACE
**	   messages) are implicitly skipped in this routine.
**	2. GCA_RESPONSE messages sent from the server, and that inform the
**	   COPY handler that there is no more COPY data to process.  In this
**	   case the COPY handler should clean up (close the file, etc) and
**	   return control to it's original caller.  The response structure
**	   will have been copied to the 'cgc_resp' field.
**	3. GCA_CDATA messages sent from the server.  In this case the COPY
**	   handler can read from the message buffers into the output area.
**
**	The COPY hander will regain control when a GCA_RESPONSE message or
**	GCA_CDATA message has been processed.
**
**	This is called in a loop to read COPY tuples, for example:
**
**	    ... client reads COPY map ...
**	    IIcgcp1_write_ack(cgc, &ack);
**
**	    while (IIcgcp5_read_data(cgc, &copy_dbv) == GCA_CDATA)

**		process copy_dbv.db_length bytes of copy_dbv.db_data
**		into COPY output area;
**	    }
**	    ... client has read response so clean up ...
**	
**  Inputs:
**	cgc		- Client general communications descriptor.
**	
**  Outputs:
**	copy_dbv	- Pointer to DBV with copy data and length information.
**	    .db_data	- Pointer to start of data area.  Will be set to the
**			  result message data area.  If the message type
**			  returned is GCA_RESPONSE this is set to null.
**	    .db_length	- The number of bytes within the data area.  If the
**			  message type returned is GCA_RESPONSE this is 0.
**			  This number of bytes MUST be processed by the caller
**			  before this routine is called again, as the next
**			  call will force GCA to read a new message buffer.
**
**	Returns:
**	    	GCA_RESPONSE or GCA_CDATA to indicate the current message type.
**	Errors:
**		None
