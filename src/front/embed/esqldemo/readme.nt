Instructions for compiling and running the sample "tmdemo" application:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains a sample program tmdemo.exe that shows how to
create and run esqlc progams of your own.  The makefile is to be used in
conjunction with Microsoft's NNAKE utility.  The command lines for esqlc,
compiling and linking are all stipulated in the makefile.  The sample
program is meant only to allow you to connect to a database and enter
simple queries.  Building and executing this sample program is a good way
of ensuring that your environment is set up correctly to use esqlc and
Microsoft's tools.

To build the sample program, go to directory %II_SYSTEM%\ingres\demo\esqlc
and type:

      nmake all


For more details about command line specifics, see the comments in the
makefile.


Files included here are:

tmdemo.sc
makefile
readme


Note that you need access to the esqlc library, 'ingres.lib' in order to link 
your application, and it should be available with the normal 
Ingres ESQL/C installation (in %II_SYSTEM%\ingres\lib).  If you 
modify paths or move files ensure that you continue to specify the 
correct path for ingres.lib.
