# History:

#	    On VMS, the sqlca is delivered as a standalone object.
#	04-feb-2005 (abbjo03)
#	    Although the sqlca is a standalone object on VMS, for the time
#	    being we'll continue to build the SQLCALIB (even though it is
#	    unused on VMS) because all the executables that link with the
#	    sqlca use SQLCALIB as their dependency (but the VMS linker options
#	    template files will continue to link with the standalone object).
