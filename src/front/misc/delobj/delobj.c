/*
** Name:	delobj.c - Delete FE Object Main Line & Entry Point.
**
** Description:
**	Defines 'main()' for main program entry for the Delete FE Object
**	utility program	and also implements its main line.
**
**	NOTE:
**		The ifdef of DGC_AOS relates to sharing of code space between
**		REPORT,	SREPORT, and COPYREP.  Thus, even though we are the
**		mainline routine, we'll expect to share the global definitions
**		as established by the REPORT mainline.
**
** History:
**	12-jan-1993 (rdrane)
**		Created.  Modelled after REPORT/SREPORT mainlines.
**	03/25/94 (dkh) - Added call to EXsetclient().
**	
**	18-sep-95 (emmag)
**		Declare the exception handler since we're going to 
**		delete it later.   Attempting to delete an exception
**		handler that hasn't been declared on NT results in a
**		GPF.
**	10-nov-1995 (canor01)
**		Use PCexit() to exit the program instead of EXsignal()
**		to avoid differences in how the exception is handled
**		on Solaris and NT.
**	04-Dec-1995 (mckba01)
**		#68839, changed exit method to PCexit(OK);
**	18-jun-97 (hayke02)
**	    Add dummy calls to force inclusion of libruntime.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
