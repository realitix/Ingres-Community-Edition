/*
** Name:	do_ifile_parse
**
** Description:
**	This routine opens the supplied ASCII file for reading, retrieves each
**	line, parses out each word on that line, places the word in an FE_DEL
**	structure as the FE object name, expands the name as required, closes
**	the ASCII file, and returns.
**
** Inputs:
**	filename	The name of the ASCII file containing the FE object
**			names.  If Ptr_fd_top is not NULL (there were FE object
**			names on the command line), then Cact_fd is expected
**			to point to the tail FE_DEL structure in the chain.
**	del_obj_type	Class of FE object to delete.  Eventually passed to
**			do_expand_name();
**
** Outputs:
**	Cact_fd will point to the tail FE_DEL structure in the chain (unless the
**	file open fails or the file contains no FE object names, in which case
**	it is unchanged).
**
** Returns:
**	FAIL if the specified input file cannot be opened.
**	OK otherwise.  Note that an empty file is not considered
**	to be an error.
**
** Side Effects:
**	The FE_DEL structure list may be augmented.

** History:

/*
** Name:	do_getwords
**
** Description:
**	This routine is an alternate implementation of STgetwords(), since that
**	routine fails for "words" of the form "owner".fe_object (it returns two
**	words "owner" and .fe_object instead of the single word
**	"owner".fe_object).  White space (space, tab, carriage return,) and
**	the comment delimiter are the only recognized word delimiters, and
**	these are not recognized within double quotes (to handle delimited
**	owners like "this owner").  Embedded double quotes must be escaped in
**	the usual manner, e.g., "ab""cd" contains one embedded double quote.
**
**	Comments are ignored.  They are introduced by DO_COMMENT_DELIM and
**	terminated by end-of-line.  Thus, there is no nesting or spanning of
**	lines.  A comment is a word delimiter.
**
**			***  N O T I C E  ***
**
**	At the moment, DELOBJ does NOT support either owner qualification of
**	FE_object names or specification of the name components as delimited
**	identifiers.  Still, this routine will be retained so that if/when this
**	support is added, we don't have to totally re-develop it.
**
**
** Inputs:
**	buf -		A pointer to a buffer containing the string to be
**			parsed.  It is assumed to be terminated by a NULL
**			(as formatted by do_readln()), and to NOT contain any
**			LF or FF.
**	del_obj_type	Class of FE object to delete.  Eventually passed to
**			do_expand_name();
**
** Outputs:
**	Cact_fd will point to the tail FE_DEL structure in the chain (unless the
**	file contains no FE object names/expandable patterns, in which case
**	it is unchanged).
**
** Returns:
**	Nothing.
**
** Side Effects:
**	The input string is essentially destroyed, since terminating white space
**	characters are replaced with NULL to effect word string termination.
**
** History:
**	12-jan-1993 (rdrane)
**		Written.
