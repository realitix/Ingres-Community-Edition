The "Change User Password" frame allows you to change the password for
an Ingres user account. Ingres user passwords provide an additional 
level of authentication when connecting to an Ingres DBMS. 
Passwords may be authenticated directly by the Ingres DBMS, or by an 
external authentication mechanism.

Any user may change their own password, if using DBMS authentication.
Privileged users may change the passwords of other users, or change the
password method (DBMS/external/none)
