This frame displays Databases With Public Access and allows you to
update the list (you must have the SECURITY user privilege to make updates).

  	COLUMN NAME	SYNOPSIS
	-----------     --------
	Database        Database name which has been GRANTed either ACCESS or
                	NOACCESS to PUBLIC. To grant public access or noaccess
                	to all databases in an installation, enter the database
                	name "all databases".
	
	Access          "yes" means Public is granted ACCESS to the database;
                	"no" means Public is granted NOACCESS to the database.

GRANT public ACCESS or NOACCESS to a database by adding a new row at the
bottom; change existing Public access to a database by changing or
"Delete"ing that row in the table field.

Once the table field contains the correct entries, select "Save".
