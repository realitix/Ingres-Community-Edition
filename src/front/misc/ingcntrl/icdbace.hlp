GRANTing ACCESS
---------------
For database 'lab' if the following entries are added to the table field
of Access privileges:

        +-------------------------+------+
        |User Name                |Access|
        +-------------------------+------+
        |user1                    |y     |
        |user2                    |n     |
        |user3                    |y     |
        +-------------------------+------+

and then the "Save" menuitem is pressed, then the following SQL statements
will be issued by Accessdb:

        GRANT ACCESS ON DATABASE lab TO USER user1;
        GRANT NOACCESS ON DATABASE lab TO USER user2;
        GRANT ACCESS ON DATABASE lab TO USER user3;

REVOKEing ACCESS
----------------
If a database currently has the following Access privileges granted:

        +-------------------------+------+
        |User Name                |Access|
        +-------------------------+------+
        |user1                    |y     |
        |user2                    |n     |
        |user3                    |y     |
        +-------------------------+------+

and you Delete each of these rows in Accessdb and press the "Save"
menuitem, then Accessdb will issue the following SQL statements:

        REVOKE ACCESS ON DATABASE lab FROM USER user1;
        REVOKE NOACCESS ON DATABASE lab FROM USER user2;
        REVOKE ACCESS ON DATABASE lab FROM USER user3;

Note that Accessdb users must have SECURITY privilege to issue these
statements (Accessdb users with only MAINTAIN_LOCATIONS privilege will not
have a "Save" menuitem, and the frame will be displayed in Read-only mode).

Users with SECURITY privilege may issue these Ingres/SQL statements 
directly, by connecting to the "iidbdb" database.
