Authorization Hierarchy
-----------------------
Ingres derives the privileges in effect for any session from the privileges
defined for the authorization identifiers (role, user, group and public)
associated with the session and any applicable defaults.  If a particular
privilege is defined for more than one authorization identifier associated
with a session, then Ingres uses a hierarchy to determine which defined
privilege is enforced for that session.

The authorization hierarchy in order of most to least precedence, is:

        role
        user
        group
        public

For each accessed object in a session, Ingres searches for a defined 
privilege that specifies that object and the desired access characteristic(s)
(select, insert, execute etc.).

If the specified object is a table, view or procedure, then one of the
authorization identifiers in effect for the session must have the required
privilege for that object in order for the session to have that privilege.
For example, to insert into a specified table, one of the authorization
identifiers associated with the session must have the insert privilege
defined for the specified table. If none of the authorization identifiers
associated with the session have this privilege and the user does not own
the table, then Ingres uses its internal default. In this case, because
the internal default for the insert privilege is not to allow inserts,
Ingres would not allow inserts into the specified table.

The authorization hierarchy is also important when the specified
object is the database because the privileges defined on the database
can be defined with different values for different authorization
identifiers. When a database privilege (for example ACCESS, or
QUERY_ROW_LIMIT) is defined at differing levels, Ingres uses the
hierarchy to determine which privilege to enforce.

Note that privileges granted on the INSTALLATION to the authorization
identifiers that apply to the session will also affect session privileges.

See the Ingres/SQL Reference Manual for more information.
