The "Edit a Location" frame allows you to examine or modify
LocationName - Area mappings.

(Note: If you do not have the MAINTAIN_LOCATIONS user permission, then you
cannot ALTER existing locations and this frame will be displayed in
read-only mode)

Once a LocationName has been created, the Area that the LocationName 
refers to cannot be changed.  You can modify the availability 
of the LocationName for data, journals, checkpoints, work, or online backup
dumps even after the LocationName has been created. The modifications
will apply to all future usage of the LocationName.

The menu commands are:

	MENU COMMANDS	SYNOPSIS
	-------------	--------
	Save            Save the changes made regarding the location.
	
	Help            Access the Ingres help facility.
	
	End             Return to the previous frame.
