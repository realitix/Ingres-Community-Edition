This frame displays all locations and their areas.  You may examine
LocationName - Area mappings.

Location Names specify Areas (disk volumes or directories) that
can be made available for database data, journals, checkpoints,
or online backup dumps.  Once the LocationName - Area mapping is
established, database tables, journals, checkpoints, or online
backup dumps can reside on the established Area.

The menu commands are:
