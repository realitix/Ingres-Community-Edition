This frame displays all locations and their areas.  You may examine,
modify, create, or delete LocationName - Area mappings.

(Note: If you do not have the MAINTAIN_LOCATIONS user permission, then you cannot
CREATE, DELETE, or ALTER existing locations and this frame will be displayed
in read-only mode)

Location Names specify Areas (disk volumes or directories) that
can be made available for database data, journals, checkpoints,
or online backup dumps. Once the LocationName - Area mapping is
established, database tables, journals, checkpoints, or online
backup dumps can reside on the established Area. The list of
databases displays those that are currently using the LocationName.

Once the LocationName has been created, the Area that the LocationName 
refers to is in read-only mode.  You can modify the availability 
of the LocationName for data, journals, checkpoints, or online backup
dumps even after the LocationName has been created. The modifications
will apply to all future usage of the LocationName.

You can only delete a location if it is unused.

The menu commands are:

	MENU COMMANDS	SYNOPSIS
