The "Create a Location" frame allows you to create 
LocationName - Area mappings.

LocationNames specify Areas (disk volumes or directories) that can be made 
available for database data, journals, checkpoints, work, or online backup 
dumps.  Once the LocationName - Area mapping is established, database tables, 
journals, checkpoints, or online backup dumps can reside on the established 
Area. 

The menu commands are:

	MENU COMMANDS	SYNOPSIS
	-------------	--------
	Save            Make the new LocationName available to the system.

	Help            Access the Ingres help facility.
	
	End             Return to the previous frame.
