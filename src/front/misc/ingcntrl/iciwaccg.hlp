GRANTing Access
---------------
If the following entries are added to the table field of Installation-Wide
Access Grants:

        +---------------+------+
        |Authorization  |      |
        |Identifier     |Access|
        +---------------+------+
        |prod           |y     |
        |test           |n     |
        +---------------+------+

and then the "Save" menuitem is pressed, then the following SQL statements
will be issued by Accessdb:

        GRANT ACCESS ON INSTALLATION TO USER prod;
        GRANT NOACCESS ON INSTALLATION TO USER test;

REVOKEing Access
----------------
If an installation currently has the following Installation-Wide Access
Grants:

        +---------------+------+
        |Authorization  |      |
        |Identifier     |Access|
        +---------------+------+
        |prod           |y     |
        |test           |n     |
        +---------------+------+

and you Delete each of these rows in Accessdb and press the "Save"
menuitem, then Accessdb will issue the following SQL statements:

        REVOKE ACCESS ON INSTALLATION FROM USER prod;
        REVOKE NOACCESS ON INSTALLATION FROM USER test;

Note that Accessdb users must have SECURITY privilege to issue these
statements (Accessdb users with only MAINTAIN_LOCATIONS privilege will not
have a "Save" menuitem, and the frame will be displayed in Read-only mode).

Users with SECURITY privilege may issue these Ingres/SQL statements 
directly, by connecting to the "iidbdb" database.
