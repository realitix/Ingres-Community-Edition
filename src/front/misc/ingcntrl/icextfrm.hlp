The "Database Extensions" frame allows you to extend databases to new 
Locations. After a database is extended its tables can be moved to or 
created on the new location.

(Note: If you do not have the MAINTAIN_LOCATIONS user permission, then this
frame will be displayed in read-only mode and you can only view existing
databases and locations. The MAINTAIN_LOCATIONS user permission is required to
extend databases to alternate locations)

Extend a database to a new Location by specifying a Location Name in a row in 
the table field. Then select the Save menuitem to perform the extension. When 
the database is extended a directory (of the same name as the database) is 
created in the Area corresponding to the Location Name.  New databases are 
automatically extended to their default Location.

The Location Name must exist.
