Ingres user privileges can be set with the CREATE USER and ALTER USER
SQL statements, and through Accessdb.

Each privilege may be active by default, or may be activated on request by
using the SET SESSION SQL statement. 

Within Accessdb the following values may be used for each privilege to
indicate the usage:
	'y' - active by default.
	'r' - active on request.
	'n' - not granted.

Privileges may also be assigned to Ingres roles using the CREATE ROLE
and ALTER ROLE Ingres/SQL statements, and to user profiles using the
CREATE PROFILE and ALTER PROFILE Ingres/SQL statements.

The following table describes the privileges that can be assigned a user in 
Accessdb.
