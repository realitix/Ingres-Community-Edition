Group and role identifiers are unique, user-defined names. A group identifier
is used to apply GRANTs to a list of Ingres users associated with the group.
A role identifier is used to associate GRANTs with applications.

Group and role identifiers are tools that the DBA can use to simplify control
of database access.

When you begin an Ingres session, the privileges in effect for that session
are derived from the privileges defined for your user identifier and Public.
If you include the -G and/or -R flag on the connect statement command line,
then the privileges for the specified group (-G) and/or role (-R) are also
in effect for the session.

Note that it is possible to define a default group identifier for a user.
If you have a default group identifier defined for your user id, when you
begin an Ingres session without specifying a group identifier, your
default group identifier is automatically applied to the session. Default
group identifiers can be defined in Accessdb.

Group identifiers are created and dropped with the CREATE GROUP and DROP
GROUP statements, respectively. Their user lists can be specified as part
of the CREATE GROUP statement and can be changed or removed using the
ALTER GROUP statement. You can view existing groups and group members
by connecting to the iidbdb database and running the SQL statement:
"SELECT * FROM iiusergroup".

Role identifiers are created and dropped with the CREATE ROLE and DROP
ROLE statements, respectively. The ALTER ROLE statement allows you to
change or remove the password of a role identifier. You can view existing
role identifiers by connecting to the iidbdb database and running the
SQL statement: "SELECT roleid FROM iirole".

See the Ingres/SQL Reference Manual for more information on Group
and Role identifiers.
