/*%
** Explanation:
**	The directory in which this program expects to be able to create and
**	write temporary files cannot have files created within it.  This
**	directory is either the temporary files directory specified by the
**	II_TEMPORARY environment variable, or is the current working
**	directory.  The likely reason for this is that you do not have
**	access rights to create files within this directory, or that
**	insufficient disk space exists in this directory for you to create 
**	or write files within it.
**
** System Status:
**	The Tables Utility will terminate.
**
** User Action:
**	Make sure that you both have access rights to the temporary directory
**	and that sufficient disk space is available to you there.  Then retry
**	execution of the Tables Utility.
