E_IM0001_Your_virtual_machine_	
"Your virtual machine is not large enough to invoke ABF\n
To run ABF requires a larger virtual machine."
/*%
** Explanation:
**	In CMS only.
**
** System Status:
**	The request will be ignored.
**
** User Action:
**	Increase the size of the virtual machine, and run again.
*/

E_IM0002_INGRES_MENU_was_not_i	"ABF cannot be invoked from here.\n
Because INGRES/MENU was invoked from another process such as ABF,
you cannot startup ABF at this point.  To use ABF from INGRES/MENU,
you must have started up INGRES/MENU directly from the operating
system."
/*%
** System Status:
**	The request will be ignored.
**
** User Action:
**	Startup INGRES/MENU from the operating system.
*/

E_IM0004_Cannot_find_form "Cannot find form '%0c' in form index file.\n
The form '%0c' is not in the form index file.  Check with your
INGRES system manager to  see if there is an installation problem
with your message and form files."
/*%
** Explanation:
**	This is caused by a bad installation.  The file "rtiforms.fnx"
**	in the language files contains the forms.  The INGRES names
**	II_TEXT, II_LANGUAGE and II_FORMFILE can affect this.  See
**	the INGRES Getting Started Guide for details.
**
** System Status:
**	INGRES/MENU will terminate.
**
** User Action:
**	Check the installation.

E_IM0005_Testing_could_not_beg

The testing system could not be started up.  Check to see if the
flags have been correctly specified."
/*%
** Explanation:
**	One of the testing options failed.  
**
** System Status:
**	INGRES/MENU will terminate.
**
** User Action:
**	Correctly specify the testing flags.
*/

E_IM0006_User_environment_impr
"User environment improperly set up.\n
One of the environment checks failed.  This usually means that
either: 1. the II_TEMPORARY INGRES name points to an area where you do
not have write access, or 2. II_TEMPORARY is not set, and you do not
have write access to your current working directory."
/*%
** Explanation:
**	When any INGRES frontend starts up, it first checks a few
**	things in the user environment to see if they are set up
**	correctly.  This is because disastrous problems could result
**	after much work has been done otherwise.  Currently, the only
**	check is to see if the temporary area is writable.  This is
**	either the user's current directory, or the area pointed to
**	by the INGRES name II_TEMPORARY.  If there would be a problem 
**	writing a file in this area, this error will occur.
**
** System Status:
**	The program will terminate.
**
** User Action:
**	Check the setting for II_TEMPORARY, or see if your working directory
**	is writable.  If not, move to another directory in which you
**	can write temporary files.

E_IM0007_ingmenu__could_not_se	
"Could not set exception handler\n"
/*%
** Explanation:
**	This should only occur if an internal error occurs.

** User Action:
**	Contact your INGRES technical support representative.
