**
**  History:
**	4/18/89 (pete)	Remove "application =%s" from subsystem call.
**			so abf will start in catalog frame.
**	11/1/89 (mdw)	Remove UTfence call for CMS due to revision
**			of ABF and repackaging of all FE components.
**	2/5/90	(pete)	Add support for -v flag to differentiate between
**			Vision and ABF. Added "item" parameter to abfstart().
**	3/20/90 (pete)	Rather than calling iiabf with -v, change to call
**			either 'abf' or 'vision'.
**	5/3/90	(pete)	Invoke xxx rather than vision.
**      16-dec-2008 (joea)
**          Replace READONLY/WSCREADONLY by const.
