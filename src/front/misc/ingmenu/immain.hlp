INGRES/MENU allows you to access any of the capabilities of the INGRES 
database management and application development system through simple
menu selections.  Position the cursor to the desired option and then
press "Select" on the command menu.

The INGRES capabilities which can be run from this menu are:

	Tables		Displays a list of the tables and views in
			the database, from which you can get detailed 
			information, or run queries or reports.  You can 
			also create and delete tables from this selection.

	Forms		Displays a list of the forms in the database,
			from which you can edit or use them to access 
			data.  You can also create and delete forms 
			using the visual forms editor (VIFRED) through 
			this selection.

	JoinDefs	Displays a list of the Join Definitions stored 
			in the database for use with the Query-By-Forms
			tool.  You can also create and delete Join
			Definitions from this selection.

	Reports		Displays a list of the reports stored in the
			database for running or editing.  Reports can
			also be created, deleted and edited by the 
			Report-By-Forms editor through this selection.

	Applications	Create, edit, or run Ingres applications through
			the Vision and/or Application-By Forms facilities.

	Queries		Use interactive SQL or QUEL, or Query-By-Forms
			to access your database.

(If you are not authorized to run one of the above INGRES capabilities, then
it will not appear in your menu.)

The following additional menu items are available:

	Select		Selects the row the cursor is currently on.

	Shell/Spawn	Escape to the operating system. To return
			to INGRES/MENU from an operating system shell,
			type "logout" or "exit".
			(this menu item will be "Shell" on some systems
			and "Spawn" or "CLI" on others)
