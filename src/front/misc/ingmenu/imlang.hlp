The INGRES/MENU Queries screen allows you to select either SQL or
QUEL to enter database commands directly, or select QBF to use the full
Query-By-Forms facilities to access data in the database. To make a
selection, place the cursor on the desired row and press "Select"
on the command menu.

The selections are:

	SQL		Use Interactive SQL to enter SQL commands directly
			to the database.

	QUEL		Use Interactive QUEL to enter QUEL commands directly
			to the database.

	QBF		Use Query-By-Forms to query or update data.

(If you are not authorized to run one of the above selections, then it will
not appear in your menu.)

The following additional menu items are available:

	Select		Selects the row the cursor is currently on.

	Cancel		Return to the main INGRES/MENU screen.

	Shell/Spawn	Escape to the operating system. To return
			to INGRES/MENU from an operating system shell,
			type "logout" or "exit".
			(this menu item will be "Shell" on some systems
			and "Spawn" or "CLI" on others)

	Help		Show this help text.
