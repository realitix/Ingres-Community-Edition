/**
** Name:	xfproc.sc - write statement to create procedure.
**
** Description:
**	This file defines:
**
**	xfprocedures		write statements to create procedures.
**
** History:
**	16-aug-88 (marian) 
**		written to support stored procedures.
**	28-sep-88 (marian)
**		Retrieve the creation date so you can sort by it and 
**		guarantee procedures will be recreated in the correct
**		order.
**	03-oct-88 (marian)
**		Use proc_count to determine if any rows were returned instead
**		of inquire_ingres.
**	11-oct-88 (marian)
**		Took out message about number of rows retrieved and put
**		it into xfwrscrp.c.
**	21-apr-89 (marian)
**		Moved STcopy lower so it will be done the first time through.
**	02-oct-89 (marian)
**		Only retrieve db procedures that do not begin with ii or _ii.
**	05-mar-1990 (mgw)
**		Changed #include <erxf.h> to #include "erxf.h" since this is
**		a local file and some platforms need to make the destinction.
**	04-may-90 (billc)
**		Major rewrite.  Convert to SQL.
**	07/10/90 (dkh) - Removed include of cf.h so we don't need to
**			 pull in copyformlib when linking unloaddb/copydb.
**	25-jul-90 (marian)
**		Add to WHERE clause procedure_name != '_ii_sequence_value'
**		because createdb creates this procedure owned by the dba
**		and reload.ing produces errors when it attempts to create
**		the procedure again.  THIS SHOULD BE REMOVED ONCE WE FIGURE
**		OUT WHAT CREATEDB SHOULD REALLY BE DOING.  
**      27-jul-1992 (billc)
**              Rename from .qsc to .sc suffix.
**	03-feb-1995 (wonst02) Bug #63766
**		For fips, look for both $ingres and $INGRES
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	28-jun-2002 (hanch04)
**	    keep track of the number of permissions statements printed,
**	    if one is printed before a procedure, we must print the go stmt.
**      10-Dec-2008 (hanal04) Bug 116958
**          Follow-up change to escape literal % in calls to STprintf().
**      28-jan-2009 (stial01)
**          Use DB_MAXNAME for database objects.
**      05-jan-2010 (frima01)
**          Use xfwrite_id instead of xfwrite for procedure names to
**          preserve white spaces.

**		Remove trim() from retrieve of iiprocedures.txt.  The trim
**		was causing necessary blanks to be removed which caused
**		syntax errors to occur during the reload.
**	10-jun-92 (billc)
**		remove date stuff: it doesn't work because orphan procedures
**		are allowed.  Go with stubbing scheme instead.
**	20-Sep-2004 (schka24)
**	    Don't exclude a procedure just because it's $ingres (eg
**	    imadb procs).  Look for system-use and ii-procedures instead,
**	    exclude those.
**      04-Apr-2011 (horda03) b125210
