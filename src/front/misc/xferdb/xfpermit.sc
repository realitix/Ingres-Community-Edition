/**
** Name:	xfpermit.sc - write statements to create permit.
**
** Description:
**	This file defines:
**
**	xfpermits	write statement to create all permits for given object.
**	xfalltoall	write statement to create all-to-all and ret-to-all
**				permits for given object.
**
** History:
**	13-jul-87 (rdesmond) written.
**	14-sep-87 (rdesmond) 
**		changed att name "number" to "permit_number" in iipermits.
**	10-nov-87 (rdesmond) 
**		added 'language', 'alltoall' and 'rettoall' parms.
**	10-mar-88 (rdesmond)
**		now writes 'ret to all' and 'all to all' in SQL only, since
**		permit may be on view, and this is not allowed in QUEL;
**		removed trim() from target list for 'text'; writes language for
**		each permit before text of permit (based on first word of text
**		being 'create' or not); writes "\p\g" after each permit.
**	11-aug-88 (marian)
**		Added a check for 'grant' so the dml will be set correctly to
**		\sql when the 'grant' or 'create' commands are given for a
**		permit.
**	18-aug-88 (marian)
**		Added support for permits on stored procedures.  The retrieve
**		on iipermits is different than the retrieve for permits on
**		tables.  Even though the retrieves are different the retrieve
**		loop that is processed for each row is the same.
**	18-aug-88 (marian)
**		Changed retrieve statement to reflect column name changes in
**	11-oct-88 (marian)
**		Removed procedure specific retrieve and added where clause
**		restriction for object_type so the same retrieve can be used
**		for permits on tables and procedures.  Added type as a new
**		input parameter.
**	20-jul-89 (marian)	bug 6715
**		Define permits correctly for quel tables.  Don't always
**		use sql statements.
**	28-jul-89 (marian)
**		Fix 6715 correctly....messed up the if statement the first
**		time.
**	05-mar-1990 (mgw)
**		Changed #include <erxf.h> to #include "erxf.h" since this is
**		a local file and some platforms need to make the destinction.
**      27-jul-1992 (billc)
**              Rename from .qsc to .sc suffix.
**      21-Mar-2000 (hanal04) Bug 100911 INGDBA 63.
**              If we are not copying the whole database generate permit
**              information using a series of restricted queries to avoid
**              unnecessarily large retrievals.
**      28-jan-2009 (stial01)
**          Use DB_MAXNAME for database objects.

**              If we are not copying the whole database use the Obj_list
**              to generated queries that retrieve permit information
**              restricted by the object (table) name.
**	22-Oct-2002 (guphs01)
**		In ingres 6.5 the iipermits catalog does not contain the 
**		value 'V' for views and they are also marked as 'T'. Thus
**		fixed the sql in post 26 case, to also check iitables so 
**		views are not written out when writing permissions.
**      13-July-2004 (zhahu02)
**          Updted for writing permits on sequences (INGSRV2893/b112604).

**          Do not transfer permits on iietab_xx_xx tables.
**          These are used for blobs, and the exact name of the target 
**          table can not be guaranteed.... It certainly will not be the
