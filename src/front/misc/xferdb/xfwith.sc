/**
** Name:	xfwith.sc - Find the with clause information for the
**				create (table) statement.
**
** Description:
**	This file defines:
**
**	xfaddloc	Find all the locations of a given table.  Retrieve
**			the information from iimulti_locations.
**
** History:
**	23-sep-88 (marian) 	bug 3512
**		Written to handle multi-locations for tables.
**	26-sep-88 (marian)
**		Add support for STAR with clause additions.
**	18-apr-89 (marian)
**		Removed xfstartwith() routine.  This routine is no longer
**		required because of the modified STAR requirements.  STAR
**		will now create a 'register' statement when the user supplies
**		a create with a 'with' clause.  This information will then
**		be unloaded when the registered objects are unloadded.
**	05-mar-1990 (mgw)
**		Changed #include <erxf.h> to #include "erxf.h" since this is
**		a local file and some platforms need to make the destinction.
**      09-sep-91 (billc)
**              Fix bug 39517 (actually, a cleanup on the side).  xfaddloc
**              now called by different clients, must differentiate.  (hack!)
**      27-jul-1992 (billc)
**              Rename from .qsc to .sc suffix.
**      06-jun-00 (gupsh01)
**              Added parameter buf to xfaddloc in order to write to buffer if
**              the buffer is provided else write to XF_in.
**      15-Oct-2001 (hanal04) Bug 105924 INGSRV 1566
**         Modified the above change to xfaddloc in order to provide
**         dynamic allocation of the buffer.
**	26-May-2002 (hanje04) 
**	   Fix for bug 105924 requires me.h to be included in order to properly
**	   relsolve MEreqmem.
**      28-jan-2009 (stial01)
**          Use DB_MAXNAME for database objects.

/*{
** Name:	xfaddloc - Add the additional locations for a table.
**
** Description:
**	Retrieves location information from iimulti_locations if it
**	exists.  If iimulti_locations does not exist, return.
**
** Inputs:
**	name		Name of the curent table.
**	owner		Owner of the current table.
**	alloc		TRUE if a buffer is to be allocated and output 
**                      is to be written to that buffer, FALSE for writing 
**                      to XF_in.
**      buf_ptr		The address of a character ptr that will receive
**                      the address of the allocated memory if alloc is TRUE.
**
** Outputs:
**      buf_ptr		Filled with the address of the allocated character
**                      buffer if alloc is TRUE.
**
**	Returns:
**		none.
**
**	Exceptions:
**		none.
**
** Side Effects:
**	If alloc is TRUE xfaddloc() will allocate a character buffer.
**      The caller must deallocate this memory when it has finished
**      using the allocated buffer.
**
** History:
**	23-sep-88 (marian)
**		Written.
**	04-may-90 (billc) convert to SQL.
**      06-jun-00 (gupsh01)
**              Added parameter buf in order to write to buffer if
**              the buffer is provided else write to XF_in.
**      15-Oct-2001 (hanal04) Bug 105924 INGSRV 1566
**         The above change provide 240 characters in which to hold
**         a comma separated list of the location names for an index.
**         With a maximum of 256 locations per index this was not adequate.
**         New/Modified parameters shown above.
