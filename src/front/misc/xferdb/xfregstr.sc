/**
** Name:	xfregstr.sc - This file is used to write out the registrations
**				definitions for INGRES STAR.
**
** Description:
**	This file defines:
**
**	xfregistrations		write statements to create the 
**				appropriate registrations.
**
** History:
**	29-sep-88 (marian) 
**		written to support REGISTRATIONS.
**	05-mar-1990 (mgw)
**		Changed #include <erxf.h> to #include "erxf.h" since this is
**		a local file and some platforms need to make the destinction.
**	04-may-90 (billc)
**		Major rewrite.  Convert to SQL.
**	19-aug-91 (billc)
**		fix 39294: was doing \p\g twice after register command. 
**      27-jul-1992 (billc)
**              Rename from .qsc to .sc suffix.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	04-sep-2002 (xu$we01)
**	    For some platforms (for example DG/UX) after an ERx constant
**	    string is assigned to a pointer, its element address become 
**	    inaccessible. Trying to assign a new value to its element
**	    causing SIGBUS error. To fix it, assign "*type" directly
**	    to an array element.
**      28-jan-2009 (stial01)
**          Use DB_MAXNAME for database objects.

/*{
** Name:	xfregistrations - write statement to create registrations.
**
** Description:
**	This now works for vanilla Ingres and for STAR, since both
**	use the iiregistrations table.
**
** Inputs:
**	type		type of object.  "T" for table,
**			"V" for view and "I" for index.
**
** Outputs:
**	numobjs		pointer to integer, so we can return the number 
**			of registrations found.
**
**	Returns:
**		none.
**
**	Exceptions:
**		none.
**
** Side Effects:
**	none.
**
** History:
**	29-sep-88 (marian) written.
**	21-apr-89 (marian)
**		Add is_distrib so the range variable can be set correctly
**		for STAR.
**	03-may-89 (marian)
**		Don't unload INDEXes for STAR.
**	27-may-89 (marian)
**		Change is_distrib to a global with_distrib
