/*{
** Name:	xfcomments - write COMMENT ON statements.
**
** Description:
**	Probably overimplemented, since currently we don't support short 
**	comments.  Long comments are limited to 1600 characters, so 
**	there is only one comment per tuple.  This is a nice simplification.
**
** Inputs:
**      t       pointer to XF_TABINFO describing the table for which
**              to generate the 'COMMENT ON' statement.	
**
** Outputs:
**	writes to the reload scripts.
**
**	Returns:
**		none.
**
** History:
**	24-aug-90 (billc) written.
**      24-nov-1999 (ashco01)
**          Reworked to accept pointer to XF_TABINFO and generate 'COMMENT ON'
**          statment for specific table only. The 'COMMENT ON' statement is now
**          written as part of the TABLES section rather than in a COMMENTS 
**          section of the COPY.IN.
**       1-Apr-2003 (hanal04) Bug 109584 INGSRV 2102
**          No need for TH_BLANK_PAD padding hack now we have rewritten
**          F_CU format in f_colfmt().
**      31-May-2006 (smeke01) Bug 116153
**          Ensured that xfcomments looks for [table- & table-column-] 
**          comments on strictly 1 table by restricting the search 
**          qualification to a named table and a named table-owner.
**          Previously table-owner was optional, since the global
**          variable Owner could be empty, so > 1 table of the same
**          name could be processed by xfcomments, leading to bug
**          116153.
