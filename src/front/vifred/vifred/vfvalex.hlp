Examples of Field Validations:

    Numeric fields:

        salary > 0
        salary IS NOT NULL
        salary <= 20000 OR (grade >= 7 AND salary <= 30000)

    Character fields:

        dept != "sales"
        emps.loc = "NE"
        manager = "Jones" OR manager = "Ortega"

        Pattern match (see footnote below):
            code = "Q[0-9][A-Z]"
            batchno = "B[0-9]?-[STPMBK]*"

        LIKE operator (Note single quotes; see footnote below):
            ident LIKE 'I_9%'
            area LIKE '%ne%'

    Date fields:

        entry_date > "1-jan-1997"
        projects.confirm_date < "today"

    Money fields:       (the money data type is not part of Open SQL)

        projects.budget > "$10,000"

    Compare with other fields:

        field > otherfield
        field IS NOT NULL AND otherfield IS NULL

    Compare to a list of values:

        number_field IN [25, 30, 35]
        tblfld.number IN [1000, 2000]

        status IN ["O", "C", "X"]
        code IN ["O??", "ER?", "*9*"]

    Compare with values in a Lookup table:

        field IN table.column
        field = "" OR field IN table.column

        tablefield.column IN table.column
        tablefield.column = "" OR tablefield.column IN table.column

Syntax of a validation clause:

        fieldname comparisonOperator [otherfield | constant]
        fieldname [IS | IS NOT] NULL
        fieldname IN [list | table.column]

        Where the "fieldname" is the internal name of the field or 
        tableFieldName.columnName for table field columns; the
        comparisonOperator is one of:

                =, <>, !=, >, >=, <, <=, LIKE

        and items in square brackets ("[]") require that you choose one.

        Validation clauses may be connected by the boolean operators
        AND, OR, and NOT. For example:   age >= 18 AND age <= 65

        Validation clauses may be grouped by enclosing them in
        parenthesis.      For example:  (age IS NULL) OR (age >= 18)

Footnotes:

    Pattern Match:
        "?" matches any single character.
        "*" matches any number of characters.
        [...] matches characters between the brackets including ranges
                (for example, "[ABC]*" equals any string that begins with
                A, B or C; "_[N-Z]" equals any two character string where
                the second character is a letter of the alphabet between
                N and Z).

    LIKE (note that single quotes are used with the LIKE operator):
        '_' matches any single character.
        '%' matches any number of characters.
