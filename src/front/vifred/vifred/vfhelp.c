/*{
** Name:	vfhelp() -	forms help utility from VIFRED.
**
** Description:
**	This is the front end to the forms help utility for RTI
**	front ends VIFRED and RBF in the following situation.  When
**	the layout form is displayed but an EQUEL SUBMENU is being
**	used, the menu structure comes from the forms system, but
**	the form does not.  If the layout menu is being used, and
**	the detailed Menu structures are used, a call to vfhelpsub
**	should be used for help.  If EQUEL forms and EQUEL menus
**	(or submenus) are being used, a call to FEhelp should be made.
**
** Inputs:
**	name		- name of file for HELP/FRAME.
**	subject		- subject name for title of help frame.
**
** History:
**	05-oct-1985 (dkh)	Fixed to work correctly for vifred/rbf.
**	13-jan-1986 (peter)	Changed third parameter to several help calls.
**	30-jan-1986 (peter)	Change to remove param from fedohelp.
**	08/14/87 (dkh) - ER changes.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	26-Aug-2009 (kschendel) b121804
**	    Move decls.h to before help.h, thanks to new stuff in help.h.

/*{
** Name:	vfhelpsub() -	forms help utility for VIFRED.
**
** Description:
**	This is the front end to the forms help utility for RTI
**	front ends VIFRED and RBF because they use a dif menu struct.
**	Note that if an EQUEL submenu is in use even in VIFRED and
**	RBF (as in the Create submenu) a call to vfhelp should be
**	used.
**
**	It puts the Help File directory in front of the file name
**	and then simply calls FEdohelp for the rest.
**
** Inputs:
**	name		- name of file for HELP/FRAME.
**	subject		- subject name for title of help frame.
**	menu		- menu structure already in place.

** History:
