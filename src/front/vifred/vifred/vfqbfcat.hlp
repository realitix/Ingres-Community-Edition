This frame lists all of the QBFNames associated with the form shown 
at the top of this frame.  A QBFname provides a mapping between the 
form and either a table or a JoinDef (created in QBF).  A JoinDef 
defines a query and its semantics for use by QBF.  Please consult 
the Ingres Character-based Querying and Reporting Tools User Guide
for more information.

You may create new QBFNames to associate with this form by selecting 
the "Create" menu command.

You may perform other menu operations on the QBFNames by positioning
the cursor over the QBFName of interest by using the cursor keys or
the table field scrolling keys.  After positioning the cursor on the
name of interest, select the appropriate menu command.

The menu commands are:
