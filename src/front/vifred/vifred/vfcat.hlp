This frame contains a table field listing all forms in the database
owned by you or by the DBA.  The "Name" column lists the form names
while the "Owner" column either lists your username, or "DBA" for
forms owned by the DBA.  The "Short Remark" column lists a short
description of each form.

To create a new form, use the "Create" menu command.  To perform one
of the menu operations on an existing form, first position the cursor
to the row containing the name of the form of interest by using the
cursor keys or the table field scrolling keys.  After the cursor has
been positioned on the row containing the form of interest, select the
menu command.

The menu commands are:

        MENU COMMANDS   SYNOPSIS
        -------------   --------
        Create          Create a new form.  You will be further prompted
                        to determine how to create the form.

        Destroy         Deletes the form you have selected from the database.
                        VIFRED verifies that you own the form and then removes
                        that form from the forms catalogs.  You will be
                        asked to confirm this decision.  You may only destroy
                        forms that you own.

        Edit            Edit the selected form.  Go to the VIFRED layout
                        frame to allow you to change the form.

        Rename          Changes the name of the form you have selected.
                        VIFRED prompts you for the new name of the form.
                        If you immediately depress the RETURN key,
                        VIFRED cancels the command and returns your
                        cursor to the table field.  If you enter
                        a correct name, VIFRED changes the name of
                        the form in the database.  You may only rename
                        forms that you own.

        MoreInfo        Display additional information on the selected
                        form.  This command brings up a new form that
                        shows the creation and last modification time
                        of the form as well as the full short and long
                        descriptions for the selected form.  You may
                        change and save the short and long descriptions
                        in the database at this point.

        Utilities       Brings up a submenu of utility functions to perform
                        on the selected form.  You can compile the form,
                        print it to a listable file, or manipulate the
                        QBFNames associated with the form.

        Go              Invoke QBF on the selected form.  If a QBFName
                        that has the same name as the selected form is
                        found in the database, VIFRED will invoke QBF
                        with the found QBFName.  Otherwise, VIFRED
                        will prompt for the name of a table in the
                        database to use with the selected form when
                        QBF is invoked.  Pressing just the RETURN key
                        in response to this prompt will cancel this
                        command.  The entered table name must exist
                        in the database in order for QBF to be invoked.

        Help            Access the Ingres Help facility.

        Quit            Exits from VIFRED.
