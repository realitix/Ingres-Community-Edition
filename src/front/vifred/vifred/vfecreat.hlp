You have elected to create a new component at the current cursor position.
You can create new trim (simple text on the screen), boxes/lines (box
graphic trim), fields (input/output windows on the screen), tablefields 
(row and column blocks of fields) or lines, (blank lines between components.)

Select the menu command corresponding to the type of the component you
wish to create, and follow the submenus displayed (if any.)

The menu commands are:

        MENU COMMANDS   SYNOPSIS
        -------------   --------
        Trim            Create a piece of trim at this location.  The
                        cursor will resume at the location you had
                        selected and you can enter up to 150 characters
                        of text to be displayed on the form.  Depress
                        the MENU KEY to indicate the end of the text.

        Field           Create a new input/output field at this location.
                        A submenu will be displayed showing the subcomponents
                        of a field that you will need to enter (title,
                        display format and attributes.)

        TableField      Create a new table field at this location.  You
                        will be placed in the table field creation frame,
                        where you can list the columns to use in the table
                        field.

        NewLine         Create a blank line above this location.
        
        Box/Line        Create a Box/Line component at this location. 
			A line component is a box which only has 
			one row, or one column, a one dimensional box.
			Note: Boxes are different from other components in
			that they are allowed to overlap other boxes. When
			Box/Line components overlap the appropriate T's and
			Crosses are displayed.  When a Box/Line component
			is overlapped by any other type of component
			the Box/Line will be obscured.
			
        Help            Access the Ingres Help facility.

        End             Return to the Form Layout frame without creating
                        a new component.
