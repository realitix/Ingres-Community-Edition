**  History:
**
**	Created - 10/02/85 (dkh)
**	04/16/87 (dkh) -Integrated rpm, unix, cms changes.
**	08/14/87 (dkh) - ER changes.
**	06/29/88 (tom) - eliminated roundup algorithm because 
**			 popup forms do much better when expansions are
**			 minimized, and it is a fairly non essential
**			 optimization to expand larger than currently
**			 needed just to (possibly) avoid a future
**			 window size expansion.
**      06/12/90 (esd) - Make the member frmaxx in FRAME during vifred
**                       include room for an attribute byte to the left
**                       of the end marker, as well as the end marker.
**                       (We won't always insert this attribute
**                       before the end marker, but we always leave
**                       room for it).
**	06/29/92 (dkh) - Added support for rulers.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	24-Feb-2010 (frima01) Bug 122490
**	    Update return types and add header files as neccessary
**	    to eliminate gcc 4.3 warnings.
