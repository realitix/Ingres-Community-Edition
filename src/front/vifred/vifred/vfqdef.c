**  	10/23/89   (martym)
**	>> GARNET <<  Changed the call to 'vfmqbf' to match the new interface.
**	26-oct-89 (bruceb)
**		Removed vfcursor() call from qdefcom().  Placed it in fdcat().
**	11/27/89   (martym)
**		Changed the decleration of 'vfmqbf' to match its new 
**		definition.
**      06/12/90 (esd) - Make the member frmaxx in FRAME during vifred
**                       include room for an attribute byte to the left
**                       of the end marker, as well as the end marker.
**                       (We won't always insert this attribute
**                       before the end marker, but we always leave
**                       room for it).
**	21-mar-94 (smc) Bug #60829
**		Added #include header(s) required to define types passed
**		in prototyped external function calls.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	24-Aug-2009 (kschendel) 121804
