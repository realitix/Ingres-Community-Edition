/*
** interface to vifred from ABF.
**
**  History:
**	08/14/87 (dkh) - ER changes.
**	11-apr-89 (bruceb)
**		Renamed IIvifred to IIVFvqvVQVifred and modified to be
**		the interface from VQ.
**	31-may-89 (bruceb)
**		Re-init form and line table memory on return from IIVFvqv.
**	29-jun-89 (bruceb)
**		Renamed to IIVFabvABVifred and modified the interface.
**	10/14/90 (dkh) - Integrated round 4 of macws changes.
**	11/02/90 (dkh) - Added code to change dml in ADF_CB to DB_SQL so that
**			 default datatype nullability in created fields is the
**			 same as standalone Vifred.  On exit, dml is set
**			 back to whatever it was before this was called.
**  25-nov-91 (gautam) - Added ris_us5 to NO_OPTIM list.
**  23-jun-92 (thomasm) Added hp8_us5 to NO_OPTIM list.
**  30-Jul-1992 (fredv)
**	Added NO_OPTIM for m88_us5. The symptom was vision sep tests failed.
**	It looked the the optimizer generated bad code so that old_dml wasn't
**	saved right. Therefore, when we restore qlang, it becomes junk.
**	09/01/92 (dkh) - Added support for group moves.
**	29-jan-97 (mosjo01)
**		Added no optim for rs4_us5 because old_dml was junk in vision
**		sep testing. Seeing ris_us5 further confirmed solution.
**	19-jan-1999 (muhpa01)
**		Removed NO_OPTIM for hp8_us5.
**      21-Jul-99 (linke01)
**              added NO_OPTIM on sgi_us5 IRIX64 6.5 on II2.5 port, sympotom
**              same as fredv's comment. it didn't happen on IRIX64 6.4 II2.0
**              port. 
**      02-Aug-1999 (hweho01)
**              Added NO_OPTIM for ris_u64. The symptom was failure of vision 
**              sep test. The version of compiler is AIX C 3.6.0.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	16-aug-2001 (toumi01)
**	    speculative i64_aix NO_OPTIM change for beta xlc_r - FIXME !!!
**      29-May-2005 (hweho01)   
**          Added NO_OPTIM for i64_hpu platform, avoid parse error (E_FI206C)
**          during FE/vis54.sep test. Star 14063593.
**	21-Aug-2009 (kschendel) 121804
**	    Need frame.h to satisfy gcc 4.3.

** Name:	IIVFabvABVifred	- Interface to VIFRED from ABF
**
** Description:
**	Interface to VIFRED from ABF.  Edit the specified form, returning
**	to ABF on saving the form or ending from form edit phase.  This
**	routine will be ABF's sole communication with Vifred.
**
**	This call is equivalent to:
**		vifred dbname -F frmname
**	or
**		vifred dbname -F frmname -Csource -Ssymbol
**
**	Note that this routine doesn't set up the FDhandler exception
**	code.  This is expected to be already established in ABF.
**
** Inputs:
**	dbasename	Name of the already opened database.
**	frmname	Name of the frame to edit.  If it doesn't exist, allow the
**		user to create it.
**	compile	TRUE if the form should be compiled after being saved.  The
**		following two arguments are ignored if this is FALSE.
**	source	Name of compiled form file.
**	symbol	Name of the symbol of the compile form.
**
** Outputs:
**
**	Returns:
**		retstatus	At present, only OK.
**
**	Exceptions:
**		None
**
** Side Effects:
**
** History:
**	11-apr-89 (bruceb)	Written.
