This frame is used to create or edit a table field.  The fields at
the top of the form represent information about the table field
as a whole, and the list at the bottom of the form holds information
about each of the columns within the selected table field.

If you are creating a new table field, fill in the appropriate
information about the table field, and select the "End" menu
command to commit the table field to the form.

The meanings of the fields at the top of the form are:

        FIELD NAME              SYNOPSIS
        ----------              --------
        Name of Table Field     Internal name to use for the table field.
                                Whenever validation checks are specified
                                for columns in the table field, they must
                                be specified with the format "table.column"

        Number of Rows          Number of displayed rows in the table field.

        Display Lines           Enter "y" if you want lines between the
                                rows in the table field to be displayed,
                                or "n" if you do not.

        Highlight Current Row   Enter "y" if you want the current row
                                (the one the cursor is on) to be displayed
                                in reverse video.  A "n" turns off the
                                highlighting.

        Display Column Titles   Enter an "n" if you do not want column
                                titles to be displayed at the top of
                                each column.  The default value is "y",
                                which displays the column titles.

        Invisible Field         Enter "y" if you do not want the table field
				to be initially displayed on the form.  The
                                default value is "n", which specifies that
                                the field is to be displayed.


The rows within the table field (called column descriptor in the rest
of this help text) represent columns in the table field component for 
your form.  Simply add new column descriptors to the table field by
filling in the rows in the form, or use the menu commands for more
advanced editing.  The columns for each descriptor have the following 
interpretations:

        FIELD NAME              SYNOPSIS
        ----------              --------
        Title of a Column       Title to use at the top of the column
                                for the table field.

        Column Internal Name    Internal name of the column.  This is
                                used to match column names in JoinDefs
                                or tables in QBF, or can be used by
                                a 3GL or a 4GL programmer for
                                special actions.

        Display Format          Valid data display format for the data
                                window for this column.

The menu commands are:

        MENU COMMANDS           SYNOPSIS
        -------------           --------
        Insert                  Insert a new column descriptor immediately
                                before the current cursor position.  A
                                default name and data format is filled in.

        Delete                  Delete the selected column descriptor.

        EditAttr                Go to the field attribute frame to edit
                                field attributes for the selected column
                                descriptor.

        Move                    Select the current column descriptor to
                                move to another position in the table.
                                This brings up a submenu to determine
                                the new position.

        GetTableDef             Prompts for the name of an existing table
                                in the database.  The columns of the 
                                selected table are used to fill in default
                                column descriptors in the table -- one for
                                each column in the table.

        Cancel                  Return to the Form Layout form, without
                                creating the new table field (on a create)
                                or without making the specified changes 
                                (on an edit).

        Help                    Access the Ingres Help facility.

        End                     Return to the Form Layout frame, creating 
                                a new or modified table field.
