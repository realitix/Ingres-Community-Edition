You have elected to create a new field.  You must enter a title and
a data window for all new fields, although you can specify them either
title first or data window first.  You can move the cursor to any
location on the form before selecting either the "Title" or "Data" menu 
command.  Normally, the title is created first, followed by the data 
window, and then the field attributes are edited.

Once you have created the title (or data window,) you can move the
cursor to any other location to position the data window (or title.)

When you are satisfied with the new field, select the "End" menu command
to commit the field to the form.  Select the "Cancel" menu command to
return to the main layout without creating the field.

The menu commands are:

        MENU COMMANDS   SYNOPSIS
        -------------   --------
        Title           Enter a new title for the field at this location.
                        After you enter a title, the cursor will remain
                        at the end of the title to facilitate entering
                        data windows to the right of field titles.

        DisplayFormat   Enter the data display format at this location.
			After selecting the "DisplayFormat" menu command,
			you should enter the data format for the data window.
			The size of the data window is determined by the
			entered display format and begins at the location
			the display format is entered.  If no datatype
			is specified (via the "Attributes" command), VIFRED
			will infer a datatype based on the entered format.
			See the Ingres Character-based Querying and Reporting
                        Tools User Guide for more information.

        Attributes      Edit the attributes for this field.  This will
                        display a new form for specifying field attributes.

        Cancel          Return to the Form Layout frame, without creating
                        this field.

        Help            Access the Ingres Help facility.

        End             Return to the Form Layout frame, after having created  
                        the new field.
