**
** History
**	08/14/87 (dkh) - ER changes.
**	08-feb-88 (bruceb)
**		In newFrame(), check for NULL pointer before calling MEfree.
**	16-oct-89 (cmr)	 moveDown(): if frame is adjusted, call newLimits()
**			 after the adjustment not before.
**	24-jan-90 (cmr)	 Get rid of calls to newLimits(); superseded by
**			 one call to SectionsUpdate() by vfUpdate().
**	04/13/90 (dkh) - Fixed bug 8630.  Checking for sideways movement
**			 (due to a fitPos() call) will now ignore the position
**			 that was passed to fitPos() if it encounters it
**			 during column checking for RBF.
**			 This can happen in following setup:
**			  heading-a    heading-b    heading-c
**			               field-b      field-c     field-a
**			 If heading-a is edited and runs into headings to
**			 right, then code will look for heading-a when
**			 it checks field-a for sideways movement.  But
**			 heading-a was unlinked when it was edited which
**			 will cause RBF to die.  This change makes things
**			 work.
**	18-apr-90 (bruceb)
**		Lint cleanup; removed 'oldcode' arg from moveBack and
**		movePosBack.
**	4/20/90 (dkh) -  Put in fix to solve a variant of bug 8630.  Default
**			 movement will now handle the case where heading-b
**			 is edited and overlaps heading-c.  RBF will now
**			 move heading-c out of the way correctly instead
**			 of putting out an overlap error message and exiting.
**      06/09/90 (esd) - Check IIVFsfaSpaceForAttr instead of
**                       calling FTspace, so that whether or not
**                       to leave room for attribute bytes can be
**                       controlled on a form-by-form basis.
**      06/12/90 (esd) - Tighten up the meaning of the global variable
**                       endxFrm.  In the past, it was usually (but
**                       not always) assumed that in a 3270 environment,
**                       the form included a blank column on the right,
**                       so that endxFrm was the 0-relative column
**                       number of that blank column at the right edge.
**                       I am removing that assumption:  endxFrm will
**                       now typically be the 0-relative column number
**                       of the rightmost column containing a feature.
**      06/12/90 (esd) - Modify inRegion and vfdistBe to allow
**                       two table fields or boxed regular fields
**                       to abut, even on 3270s.
**	07/12/90 (dkh) - Put in NULL pointer check for pos_tofit since
**			 moving a column needs to bypass what pos_tofit is
**			 used for.
**	10/31/90 (dkh) - Initialized struct in compOver() so that
**			 overlapped calculations don't use garbage values.
**	26-may-92 (rogerf) DeskTop Porting Change:
**			 Added scrollbar processing inside SCROLLBARS ifdef.
**	06/10/92 (dkh) - Changes for rulers support.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	6-Jul-2009 (kschendel) SIR 122138
**	    SPARC solaris compiled 64-bit flunks undo test, fix by properly
**	    declaring exChange (for pointers) and exi4Change (for i4's).
**	aug-2009 (stephenb)
**		Prototyping front-ends
**	24-Feb-2010 (frima01) Bug 122490
**	    Update return types and add header files as neccessary
**	    to eliminate gcc 4.3 warnings.
