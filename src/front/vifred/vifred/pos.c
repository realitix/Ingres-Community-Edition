**
** History:
**	12/21/84 DRH - Allocate line table with FEcalloc.  Allocate a pos
**		       in palloc() using the line table tag.
**	01/16/85 DRH - Allocate in palloc() using FEtcalloc.
**	1-25-85 (peterk) - separated routines dealing with building
**		line table into another file lines.c.
**	2/6/85 (peterk) - removed commented-out lines
**	13-jul-87 (bab) Changed memory allocation to use [FM]Ereqmem.
**	08/14/87 (dkh) - ER changes.
**      06/12/90 (esd) - Test for overlapping features by calling
**                       inRegion instead of invoking the 'within' macro
**                       (inRegion has been modified to allow two
**                       table fields or boxed regular fields to abut,
**                       even on 3270s).
**      06/12/90 (esd) - Remove code that sets spacesize from FTspace,
**                       since the 'within' macro no longer uses it.
**                       Note that the change to the 'within' macro
**                       fixes a bug (in onPos) that caused a feature
**                       to be selected on a 3270 when the cursor was
**                       positioned just to the right of the feature,
**                       even when there was an edge of a box directly
**                       under the cursor.
**      06/12/90 (esd) - Support new parm 'attr_reqd' to palloc.
**	06/10/92 (dkh) - Changes for rulers support.
**	04/16/98 (tlk) - Renamed unlink to pos_unlink as it conflicted 
**			 with a DEC C function by the same name.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	24-Feb-2010 (frima01) Bug 122490
**	    Update return types and add header files as neccessary
**	    to eliminate gcc 4.3 warnings.
