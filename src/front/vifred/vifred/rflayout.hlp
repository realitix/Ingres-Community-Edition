The layout menu allows you to move the cursor around the report layout,
either to position the location of new components, or to select existing
components of the report for further editing.  The cursor movement commands 
are single character commands, listed in Help for Keys.

The report is shown as a collection of sections, which correspond to various 
parts of the report.  The following sections are allowed:

        SECTION         DESCRIPTION
        -------         -----------
        Report Header   This will be printed only on the first page of
                        the report.

        Page Header     This will be printed below the report header,
                        and at the top of each page in the report.

                        in the order specified by the sort sequence
                        of the break columns.

                        table associated with this report.

                        in the order specified by the sort sequence
                        of the break columns.

        Page Footer     This will be printed above the report footer,
                        and at the bottom of each page in the report.

        Report Footer   This will be printed only at the end of the
                        report.


To create new components on the report, simply position the cursor to the 
location on the screen where you want the new component created, select 
the 'Create' menu command, and follow the submenu appropriate to that type 
of component.

To change aspects of existing components, position the cursor to anywhere
on the component, and select the appropriate menu command.

The menu commands are:

                        the types of components from which to choose.
                        If the new component will overlap some existing
                        components, RBF will move the old components
                        out of the way.

                        location on the screen.  A submenu will be displayed
