The Field Derivation frame allows you to change the derivation formula for
the field.  This field contains the same value as does the field of the same
name on the Field Attributes frame.  The only difference is that in this
frame the field is not scrollable, and all the text may be viewed at one time.


The field descriptions are:

        FIELD NAME              SYNOPSIS
        ----------              --------
	Derivation Formula      The value of the field is determined from
				using this formula.


The menu commands are:

        MENU COMMANDS           SYNOPSIS
        -------------           --------
        Help                    Access the Ingres Help facility.

        End                     Return to the main Field Attributes form.
