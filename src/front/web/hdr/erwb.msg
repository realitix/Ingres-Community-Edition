The database connection timeout value is used to determine when to disconnect\n
a user from a database session. If a user connected to a specified database\n
has not requested any database activity before the timeout value is reached,\n
the user is automatically disconnected and must reconnect before processing\n
continues. Enabling the connection timeout value allows clients to make many\n
requests to the same database without reconnecting first each time. This\n 
increases the processing speed of a user's request. The connection timeout\n
value is used when Ingres/ICE and a Web server are initialized\n
together. A value of \"0\" means\n to disconnect users from their database\n
sessions as soon as their request is complete. This has pretty much the same\n
