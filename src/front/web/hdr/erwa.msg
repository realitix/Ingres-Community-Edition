"<STRONG>Database Connection Timeout:</STRONG>\n<BR>\n
The database connection timeout value is used to determine when to disconnect\n
a user from a database session. If a user connected to a specified database\n
has not requested any database activity before the timeout value is reached,\n
the user is automatically disconnected and must reconnect before processing\n
continues. Enabling the connection timeout value allows clients to make many\n
requests to the same database without reconnecting first each time. This\n 
increases the processing speed of a user's request. The connection timeout\n
value is used when Ingres/ICE and a Web server are initialized\n
together. A value of \"0\" means\n to disconnect users from their database\n
sessions as soon as their request is complete. This has pretty much the same\n
effect as running Ingres/ICE as a CGI application. The default value\n
is <strong>300 seconds (5 minutes)</strong>\n"

The directory label is used to identify the location where client output is\n

<strong>ii_output_dir</strong> on an HTML form. By using directory labels,\n
clients that view your HTML source cannot determine the physical location of\n
Ingres/ICE request output. If a client knew where your output was\n

The file expiration time is used by Ingres/ICE to remove any files in\n

The longer the expiration time, the longer clients have access to a particular\n
