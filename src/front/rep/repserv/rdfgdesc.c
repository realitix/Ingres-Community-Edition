/*{
** Name:	RSrdf_gdesc	- request description of a table
**
** Description:
**	This routine is named after the DBMS's RDF routine but is much
**	simpler.  It searches the "RDF" control block for a table
**	matching the name passed as an argument.  Currently it uses a
**	linear search, which can later be changed to a binary search.
**	
** Inputs:
**      table_no	- table number
**
** Outputs:
**	table_ptr	- pointer to a RS_TBLDESC structure, NULL if not found
**
** Returns:
**	OK	Function completed normally.
**	FAIL	No such table was found.
