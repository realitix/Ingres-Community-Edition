CONSISTENT DISTRIBUTED DATA SET (CDDS)

The CDDS defines what data is replicated and where it resides.

The CDDS is a subset of data which is kept consistent (identical) across
all databases taking part in the replication.  A CDDS provides a method
of defining and grouping data so that an entire database or parts of
databases can be replicated to different target sites.  The CDDS gives
the Distributed DBA the ability to replicate information according to
the needs of the business.  Data can be replicated precisely when, where
and how the company requires.  Changes to data in a CDDS must only be
permitted to take place in Full Peer mode.  This is not strictly
enforced by Replicator, but will result in collisions if not adhered to.

A CDDS can consist of:

  -  An entire database

  -  A subset of tables

  -  A subset of columns (vertical partitioning)

  -  A subset of rows based on values (horizontal partitioning)
