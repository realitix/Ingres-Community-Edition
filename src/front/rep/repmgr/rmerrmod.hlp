ERROR HANDLING

Error handling is specified at the CDDS level; when defining your CDDS
you must specify which error mode you want to use.  The method the
servers use to handle an error detected while transmitting information
depends on the error mode.

For all error modes, when a server detects an error it does the
following:

  -  Logs the error, thereby increasing the error count

  -  Issues e-mail messages to the users on the mail notification list.


Further server behavior for each error mode is described in the
following list:

o  SkipTransaction (0)

   This is the default setting.  The Replicator Server:

    -  Rolls back the current replication transaction

    -  Processes the next transaction

    -  Retries the transaction in error during the processing of the
       next replication cycle in the distribution queue


o  SkipRow (1)

   The Replicator Server continues from the error with no rollback
   performed.  The record in error is skipped and processing proceeds to
   the next record.  The record in error remains on the queue.

   Note:  This setting disables transaction consistency, therefore data
          integrity may have to be maintained manually.


o  QuietCDDS (2)

   The Replicator Server rolls back the current replication transaction.
   During the rollback of the transaction in error, the Replicator
   Server quiets the CDDS for the database where the transaction error
   occurred.

   The Replicator Server continues processing the remaining replicated
   transactions for other CDDS's.


o  QuietDatabase (3)

   The Replicator Server rolls back the current replication transaction.
   During the rollback of the transaction in error, the Replicator
   Server quiets the database where the transaction error occurred.

   The Replicator Server continues processing the remaining replicated
   transactions for other databases.


o  QuietServer (4)

   The Replicator Server:

    -  Rolls back the current replication transaction

    -  Stops processing of the remaining batch of replicated
       transactions

    -  Changes its status from active to quiet mode.
