CDDS Target Types

CDDS Target Type refers to the level of replication support for a CDDS
at a given database.  Target types are defined for each CDDS in a
database.  Therefore, a database can have more than one Target Type if
it contains more than one CDDS.

The following CDDS Target Types are supported:

Full Peer               A full peer target is required for production
                        CDDS's where data is first manipulated by
                        interactive users or other processes.  It
                        allows changes to be made as well as received,
                        with collision detection or resolution.

Protected read-only     A protected read-only target is used to receive
                        information from a Full Peer database.  The term
                        protected means that this database contains
                        sufficient information to detect collisions
                        against the source copy of the data.

Unprotected read-only   In unprotected mode, there is no protection
                        against any change that is made to a replicated
                        table from another source database.  Hence, use
                        unprotected read-only target only if one full
                        peer database sends information to the read-only
                        database.
