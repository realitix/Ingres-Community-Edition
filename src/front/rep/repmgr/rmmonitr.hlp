REPLICATION MONITOR

This screen is used to monitor Replicator Server activity.  You can also
start, stop, and ping a server from this screen as well as issue database
events to override the server startup flags.

For all active servers, this screen shows the total number of outgoing
and incoming records, the total number of transactions associated with
the incoming and outgoing records, and the queue activity for each
database that the servers are supporting.  Note that these counts are
transient and may include transactions that were rolled back.

This screen uses the FRS time-out feature to determine when to look for
server activity.  No status information retrieval is attempted until the
keyboard has been idle for five seconds.

The fields on the screen are:

        FIELD NAME      DESCRIPTION
        ----------      -----------
        Server          The server number.  Only Replicator Servers who
                        have been assigned targets are listed.

        Status          This displays status messages for a server.
                        When you start a server, it shows "Starting
                        Replicator Server".  When a server completes is
                        startup procedures a message formatted as
                        follows is shown:

                        Active, n errors, Ping n, db n vnode::dbname

                        A server is either active or quiet.  An active
                        server processes distributed transactions as
                        they are created or received.  A quiet server
                        only processes transactions in response to a
                        Go database event.

                        If a server is not running or if it is hung up,
                        the screen does not display a status.  If the
                        server is processing a batch of replicated
                        transactions, it does not display a status until
                        it is finished processing the current batch.
                        However, the display will continue to reflect
                        the server's incrementing incoming and outgoing
                        record counts.

                        After the status, the number of level 1 errors
                        (configuration, time-out, transmissions, and
                        fatal errors) the server has encountered is
                        displayed.  If the number of errors reaches the
                        -EMX startup flag value, the server will shut
                        down.  The default -EMX value is 100.

                        Following the error count, the number of times
                        the server has been "ping'd" is shown.  Use the
                        Ping operation to determine which servers are
                        alive.  A ping sends a database event that in
                        turn requests the server to send back a database
                        event.  If the event increases the ping number
                        of the server, this indicates the server is
                        alive.

                        The last items on the Status line are the
                        database number, virtual node, and database name
                        of the database the server is connected to.

                        When you select Stop, the message "Shutting
                        down the Replicator Server" is displayed.  When
                        the server completes shutting down, "The Server
                        has shutdown" is shown.

        Outgoing        Number of records that have been processed and
        Records         transmitted by the Replicator Servers attached
                        to this source database.  A replicated command
                        that is successfully executed and then rolled
                        back is reflected in the count.  The Inserts,
                        Updates, Deletes, Total and Transactions fields
                        only accumulate while the Monitor screen is
                        displayed.

        Incoming        Number of records that have arrived at this
        Records         database from other replicated databases.  A
                        replicated command that is successfully executed
                        and then rolled back is reflected in the count.
                        The Inserts, Updates, Deletes, Total and
                        Transactions fields only accumulate while the
                        Monitor screen is displayed.

        Queues          Contains queue information only if you select
                        the Queues operation.  When selected, this box
                        displays in the Input and Distribution fields, a
                        snapshot count of the records that are currently
                        in the database's input queue and distribution
                        queue.

                        Note:  This information does not update
                        automatically; it is only updated when you use
                        the Queues operation.

        Activity        The display area under the three boxes gives
        Display         additional information on the transactions
                        processed in the following formats:

                        db_no  vnode::dbname  owner.table    count
                        db_no  vnode::dbname  Transactions   count

                        For example:

                        11  sfo::west  'testenv.tab1'   9
                        11  sfo::west  Transactions     6

                        In the first format, the owner.table field
                        reflects the activity that occurred on the table
                        of that name.  The count field reflects both the
                        incoming records sent to this database from the
                        target indicated in db_no field, as well as the
                        outgoing records sent to the target by table
                        from this database.

                        In the first example, assume you have run
                        Replicator Manager against database 20.  There
                        are 9 records with activity on table 'tab1' that
                        have either been incoming from database 11 to
                        database 20 or outgoing from database 20 to
                        database 11.

                        If the second format, the count field reflects
                        the number of transactions that the servers on
                        this database have successfully executed on that
                        database.

                        In the second example, assume you have run
                        Replicator Manager against database 20.  There
                        are 6 transactions that the server on database
                        20 has successfully executed on database 11.


The menu commands are as follows:

        MENU COMMAND    SYNOPSIS
        ------------    --------
        Server          Presents the following submenu commands:

            Start       Start the currently highlighted server.  To
                        start, a server must have one or more database
                        assignments (see ShowAssign command) and a
                        configuration file (see EditConfig command).
                        Only one server with a given server number can
                        be running at one time.

                        If startup is successful, an Active/Quiet
                        message (see Status above) will be displayed
                        beside the server number.

            Stop        Shut down the currently highlighted server.
                        Before a server is stopped, it will complete
                        current processing, or transmitting any current
                        replicated transaction.

                        If shutdown is successful, a confirmation
                        message will be displayed beside the server
                        number.

            EditConfig  Edit the configuration file for the currently
                        highlighted server.

            ShowAssign  Display the current database and CDDS
                        assignments for the currently highlighted
                        server.

            Cancel      Return to the other menu commands.

        Ping            Raise a dd_ping database event on running
                        servers.  Within a few seconds, the count on the
                        Ping field of the servers' status lines
                        increments by one.  If the count does not
                        increment, the servers are not alive or are busy.
                        Each event sent to a server also increments the
                        ping count.  The first time that you enter the
                        Monitor screen a dd_ping event is raised for you.

        Queues          Display a current snapshot of the count of items
                        in the input and distribution queues.

        Events          Raise a database event directed at one or all of
                        the running servers, in particular to modify
                        server parameters.  A screen listing the
                        possible events will be displayed.

        Shell           Escape to the operating system.  To return to
                        Replicator Manager from an operating system
                        shell, type "logout" or "exit"

        Clear           Clear all displayed fields.

        Help            Access the Help facility.

        End             Return to the Main Menu.
