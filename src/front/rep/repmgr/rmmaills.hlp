MAIL NOTIFICATION LIST

This screen is used to change e-mail addresses that are set up to
receive Replicator error messages.  You can add new addresses, update
or delete existing ones.  The mail notification list for each Replicator
installation must be set up separately while logged on to that machine.

The column of the list is:

        COLUMN NAME     DESCRIPTION
        -----------     -----------
        Mail Address    The e-mail address of a person who should
                        receive Replicator error messages.  If the
                        Replicator Server will be running on the same
                        machine as the user, you may only need to enter
                        the user account.  Otherwise, you may have to
                        enter routing information.  For example,

                        UNIX
                                smith@lon

                        VMS
                                lon::smith.
