MOVE CONFIGURATION DATA

This screen is used to move core information (database definitions,
CDDS and path definitions, and table configurations including support
objects) from the local database to its assigned targets.  This ensures
that all the replicated databases contain identical information.

The database targets displayed on this screen are those that have at
least one Full Peer or Protected Read-Only CDDS.  Databases that only
have Unprotected Read-Only CDDS's, as well as the local database, are
not shown.

You are required to move configuration information from the local
database to its targets whenever you:

  -  Complete the initial registration of tables

  -  Reconfigure Replicator by adding databases, CDDS's or paths, or
     change the existing ones

  -  Register new tables for replication or change the registration
     (e.g., columns, keys, lookup tables) of existing ones

Prior to moving the configuration for the first time, you should have
created the Replicator catalogs by running 'repcat' against the target
database.  In addition, in order for horizontally partitioned tables
to be configured correctly at the target databases, the respective
lookup tables should exist at the targets and be populated with all the
required rows.

The columns on the list are:

        COLUMN NAME     DESCRIPTION
        -----------     -----------
        No.             The database number.  This is a unique
                        system-wide identifier assigned by the user.

        Database        The virtual node name plus the database name.

        DBMS Type       The type of database, for example, Ingres
                        or CA-Datacom.
