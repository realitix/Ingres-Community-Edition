DATA PROPAGATION PATH (DPP)

The DPP defines what route the data takes to reach target databases
within a CDDS.

Replicator moves information from one database to another according to
the Data Propagation Path for that CDDS.  In a Data Propagation Path, a
database can be one of three types:  originator, local or target.  Each
of these types is defines as follows:

Originator      The database where a user made a change to a replicated
                table.

Local           The database that propagates the change to the target.
                This is the last database that the change goes through
                before reaching the target.  The local database can be
                the same as the originator database.  A local database
                must be a target database in another path (it must
                receive the data as a target) before it can propagate
                the data as a local database.

Target          The database that receives the change.  Every database
                in the CDDS must be a target.  The target and the
                originator database cannot be the same in a given path.
