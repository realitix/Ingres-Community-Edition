DEFINE DATA PROPAGATION PATHS

This form is used to view and define the Data Propagation Paths (DPP)
for a given CDDS.  Data propagation is based on the database that
originated the change to a table row.

Changes can be sent directly or indirectly to a target from the
originating database.  If sent directly, a path is defined with the same
database number for the originating and local databases.  If sent via an
intermediary database(s), two or more paths are defined, the first one
with the first pass-through database as the target, the second one with
the pass-through database as local and the final destination (or another
intermediary) as target.

To complete this screen, enter the appropriate values for the CDDS.  Use
the Tab key to move from one column to the next.  Use the Newrow key or
the arrow keys to move between lines.  To add a new path, use the
Insert operation to open a blank row.  To remove a path, use the
RowDelete operation.  To remove all paths for a CDDS, use the Delete
operation.  To save the definition, select the Save operation.

The columns on the list are:

        COLUMN NAME             DESCRIPTION
        -----------             -----------
        Orig#                   The system-wide unique number for a
                                database assigned by the user.  This is
                                the database in which a user makes a
                                change:  the origin of the replication.

                                Select the Subtopics menuitem for more
                                information.

        Originator Database     The name of the originator database.
                                This field is automatically filled in.

        Loc#                    The system-wide unique number for a
                                database assigned by the user.  This is
                                the last database to forward on the
                                replication.  It can be the same as the
                                originator database, but cannot be equal
                                to the target database.

                                Select the Subtopics menuitem for more
                                information.

        Local Database          The name of the local database.  This
                                field is automatically filled in.

        Targ#                   The system-wide unique number for a
                                database assigned by the user.  This is
                                a destination of the replication.

                                Select the Subtopics menuitem for more
                                information.

        Target Database         The name of the target database.  This
                                field is automatically filled in.
