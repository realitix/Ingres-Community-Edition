EDIT TABLE REGISTRATION DETAILS

This form is used to change the registration information for a
replicated table.

To make a change, use the Tab key to move to the desired field and enter
the new value.  To save the changed definition, select the Save
operation.

The fields on the left side of the form are:

        FIELD NAME              DESCRIPTION
        ----------              -----------
        Name                    The table name.

        Owner                   The owner of the table.

        CDDS No                 The CDDS number to which the table has
                                been assigned.  The CDDS name is
                                displayed next to the number.  By
                                default, tables are initially assigned
                                to CDDS 0 (the Default CDDS).  You can
                                specify a different CDDS in this field.
                                Use ListChoices to see a list of defined
                                CDDS's.

        Unique Index Used       The unique storage structure or index
                                used as primary key for replication.
                                The default registration will select the
                                base table storage structure if it is
                                unique, or the first (alphabetically)
                                unique secondary index.  You can
                                override this selection here.  If the
                                table has more than one secondary index,
                                you can use ListChoices to list the
                                indexes.

        Horizontal Partition    The name of the lookup table for
        Lookup                  horizontal partitioning.  The lookup
                                table must have a column named
                                'cdds_no'.  Use ListChoices to see a
                                list of valid lookup tables.

        Priority Collision      The name of the lookup table to
        Resolution Lookup       determine priority collision resolution.
                                The lookup table must have a column
                                named 'dd_priority'.  Use ListChoices to
                                see a list of valid lookup tables.

        Columns Registered      The date and time that the columns in
                                this table were last registered.  This
                                field is not editable.

        Support Objects         The date and time that the support
        Created                 objects for this table were last
                                created. This field is not editable.

        Recording Enabled       The date and time that change recording
                                was enabled for this table.  This field
                                is not editable.


The columns in the table field on the right are:

        COLUMN NAME             DESCRIPTION
        -----------             -----------
        Column Registered       Indicates whether the column is
                                registered for replication.  The default
                                registration process registers all
                                columns.  You can change this default by
                                entering an 'n' for any column you do
                                not want to replicate.  Note, however,
                                that all the columns that are part of
                                the key and those columns that are
                                defined as NOT NULL NOT DEFAULT must be
                                replicated.  To replicate a column that
                                is not being replicated, enter a 'y' in
                                this column.

        Key Sequence            Indicates the sequence of the column in
                                the table's unique storage structure or
                                index.  Columns with a value of 0 are
                                not part of the key.  This column is not
                                editable.

        Column Name             The name of the column.


The menu commands are as follows:

        MENU COMMAND    SYNOPSIS

        Save            Save the definition and return to the Table
                        Registration Summary screen.  If support objects
                        exist, you will be prompted for confirmation
                        since they will have to be recreated.

        ListChoices     Display a list of acceptable values for the
                        current field.

        Help            Access the Help facility.
