TABLE REGISTRATION SUMMARY

This screen contains a list of all tables in the database and their
replication configuration status.  By default, each table is initially
shown as assigned to CDDS 0.  Replicator can only detect changes in
tables that are fully registered and configured for replication.

The columns of the list are:

        COLUMN NAME     DESCRIPTION
        -----------     -----------
        Table Name      The name of the table.

        Owner           The owner of the table.

        CDDS Name       The name of the CDDS under which the table is
                        registered.  The default name is "Default CDDS".

        Reg             Indicates whether columns in the table have been
                        registered.  Values for this column are "yes"
                        and "E".  An "E" indicates an error occurred
                        when registration was attempted.

        Sup             Indicates whether the table has had its support
                        objects generated.  Values for this column are
                        "yes" and "E".  An "E" indicates an error
                        occurred when creation of support objects was
                        attempted.

        Act             Indicates whether change recording is enabled for
                        this table.  Values for this column are "yes" and
                        "E".  An "E" indicates an error occurred when
                        change recording activation was attempted.


The menu commands are as follows:

        MENU COMMAND    SYNOPSIS
        ------------    --------
        Register        Perform the default registration for the
                        currently highlighted table or all valid tables
                        in the list.  A sub-menu is displayed to allow
                        you to choose between a single table or all
                        tables.  To be registered a table must have a
                        unique primary storage structure or a unique
                        secondary index.

        DeRegister      Remove the registration for the currently
                        highlighted table or all registered tables.  Any
                        existing support objects (shadow table, archive
                        table, database procedures) are dropped first.
                        A sub-menu is displayed to allow you to choose
                        between a single table or all tables.

        Edit            Edit the registration information for the
                        currently highlighted table, including
                        deregistering specific columns, changing the
                        CDDS assignment, and assigning lookup tables for
                        horizontal partitioning and priority collision
                        resolution.

        Support         Create support objects for the currently
                        highlighted table or all valid tables in the
                        list.  A sub-menu is displayed to allow you to
                        choose between a single table or all tables.  To
                        create support objects a table must have been
                        successfully registered.

                        If the table is assigned to a CDDS that is Full
                        Peer in the local database, a shadow table, an
                        archive table and remote replication procedures
                        are created.  If the table is assigned to a CDDS
                        that is Protected Read-Only in the local database,
                        a shadow table and remote replication procedures
                        are created.  If the table is assigned to a
                        CDDS that is Unprotected Read-Only in the local
                        database, no support objects are necessary.

                        For support objects to be created, the
                        relationship between the CDDS assigned to the
                        table and the local database must have been
                        defined.  In addition, in order to correctly
                        configure horizontally partitioned tables, the
                        CDDS lookup table must exist and be populated
                        with the required rows.

        Activation      Enable or disable change recording for the
                        currently highlighted table.  A sub-menu is
                        displayed to allow you to choose between
                        activating (enabling recording) or
                        deactivating (disabling recording).

                        To be activated, a table's support objects must
                        have been created.  Change recording is only
                        necessary if the table is assigned to a CDDS
                        that is Full Peer in the local database.

        CreateKeys      Create initial rows in the shadow table, and
                        optionally in the input queue, for the currently
                        highlighted table or all registered tables.  A
                        sub-menu is displayed to allow you to choose
                        between a single table or all tables.  A second
                        sub-menu is then presented to allow you to
                        choose between populating only the shadow table
                        or adding to both the shadow and the input
                        queue.

                        Creating initial rows in the shadow table is
                        suggested for tables that already have data in
                        them.  Adding rows to the input queue allows you
                        to populate an empty table in a target database
                        using the Replication Server.  Note, however,
                        that it may be faster to user 'copydb' or
                        similar utilities.

        Help            Access the Help facility.

        End             Return to the Configuration Menu.
