RESOLVER REPORTS MENU

This menu is used to run one of six report options for maintaining or
troubleshooting the Replicator system.

The following selections are available:

        SELECTION       ALLOWS YOU TO
        ---------       -------------
        Collision       Run the Queue Collision Report which lists
                        collision conflicts for items in the local
                        distribution queue.

        Integrity       Run the Table Integrity Report which compares a
                        replicated table on two different databases.

        Distrib Config  Run the Distributed Configuration Checker Report
                        which details any configuration differences
                        between the local database and other databases
                        in the replication scheme.  These differences
                        include registered tables and columns, database
                        number, name, vnode, CDDS's, paths and so forth.

        Databases       Run the Databases Report which lists all the
                        databases in the replication scheme.  This
                        report is equivalent to the contents of the
                        Database Summary screen.

        CDDS            Run the CDDS Data Propagation Paths Report which
                        lists all CDDS's and their respective paths.
                        This report is equivalent to the contents of the
                        Propagation Path Definition screen.

        Tables          Run the Registered Tables Report which displays
                        information on all tables registered for
                        replication.  This report is equivalent to the
                        contents of the Table Registration Summary and
                        the related Table Registration Detail screens.
