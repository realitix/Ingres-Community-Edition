TABLE INTEGRITY REPORT

This form is to used specify a report to compare a replicated table in
two different databases.  You specify the criteria for the comparison
based on transaction begin and end time, and if desired, a CDDS number.
You can also designate the sort order of the report by replicated column
or transaction time.

When you execute the report, it first checks that the table keys are
forced to be unique either by the table structure or by a secondary
index.  If they are not, a message appears on the report.  It then
compares the tables in the two databases and reports any rows that are
present in one but not in the other.  This comparison is performed on
the entire row.  If there is a row that differs in only one column, it
appears on the report as having one set of data missing from the second
database, and the slightly different data is reported as missing from
the first database.  The report shows which database holds the data, and
all of the columns and values.

The fields on the form are:

        FIELD NAME              DESCRIPTION
        ----------              -----------
        Compare contents of     The name of the replicated table that
                                you want to compare.

        for owner               If there is only one owner with a table
                                by that name, this field is
                                automatically filled in with the table
                                owner.

                                For tables with multiple owners, a
                                pop-up table appears when you land on
                                the field, allowing you to select the
                                appropriate owner.

        in Consistent           If the table is not horizontally
        Distributed Data Set    partitioned, this field is automatically
                                filled in with the CDDS number under
                                which the table is registered.

                                For horizontally partitioned tables,
                                enter a CDDS number from the CDDS lookup
                                table.  You can use ListChoices to view
                                a list of acceptable values.

        in Database Number 1    The number of the first database that
                                you want to compare with a second
                                replicated database.

        and Database Number 2   The number of the second database that
                                you want to compare with the first.

        Begin                   This is an optional field to enter the
                                beginning of a date range in standard
                                Ingres date and time format.

        End                     This is an optional field to enter the
                                end of a date range in standard
                                Ingres date and time format.

        Column Name             When you enter a table name, this column
                                displays the names of all registered
                                columns for the specified table.  It
                                also adds a 'trans_time' column
                                representing the transaction time.

        Order                   To display rows in a specific order,
                                enter values beside each column name
                                (from 1 to number of columns displayed).
