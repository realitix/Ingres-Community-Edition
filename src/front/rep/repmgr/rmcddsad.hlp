The fields on the form are:

        FIELD NAME      DESCRIPTION
        ----------      -----------
        CDDS Number     A mandatory field to specify a unique number
                        within the whole replication system.  The
                        default value is 0 (which is created when you
                        install the Replicator catalogs).  By default,
                        CDDS 0 is assigned initially to any table you
                        register for replication.  Therefore, unless you
                        want all tables in CDDS 0, you should create
                        other CDDS's (with a number between 1 and
                        32,767).

                        they cannot be resolved).  Select the Subtopics
