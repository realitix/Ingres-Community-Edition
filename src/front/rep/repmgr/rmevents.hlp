SEND DATABASE EVENT

servers that are currently running against the local database.

The majority of events are designed to modify one of the server
parameters and thus affect the run-time behavior of the servers.

The columns on the list are:

                        parameter that can be modified at run-time.

        Description     A description of the database event.
