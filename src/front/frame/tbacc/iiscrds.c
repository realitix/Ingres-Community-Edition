/*{
** Name:	IIscr_ds	-	Scroll tablefield dataset
**
** Description:
**	Scroll a tablefield one or more rows at a time.  Before a row is
**	scrolled off the screen, call IIretrow to update the
**	dataset with any changes.  Then call FDcopytab() to
**	copy the displayed data up or down.  Finally, call
**	IIdisprow to display the new row scrolled in.
**
**	A scroll UP means get data records from BELOW,
**	A scroll DOWN means get data records from ABOVE.
**	The amount of rows to scroll is determined by the difference
**	between the tfcurrow  and  tflastrow values for the tablefield.
**
** Inputs:
**	tb		Ptr to the tablefield to scroll
**	direc		Flag - scroll up or down
**
** Outputs:
**
** Returns:
**	i4	TRUE
**		FALSE
**
** Exceptions:
**	none
**
** Side Effects:
**	Updates the pointers in the dataset structure to reflect the
**	rows that are currently displayed.
**	The  fields tfcurrow is incr/decr based on size of scroll done.
**
** History:
**		04-mar-1983 	- written (ncg)
**		30-apr-1984	- Improved interface to FD routines (ncg)
**		13-jun-1985	- Remove "fake-row" if scrolled out under the
**				  data set. (ncg)
**		18-feb-1987	- Changed rp_rec reference to rp_data (drh)
**	03/16/97 (cohmi01)
**	    Rewrite to support block mode scrolling - for bug 73587.
**	    As a result tfcurrow is incr/decr here, causing fewer calls
**	    to this routine from tbchkscr/tbophdlr logic.
**	04/15/97 (cohmi01)
**	    Keep track of ordinal position in dataset. (b81574)
**  30-july-1997 (rodjo04)
**      If num_new is zero or less, then the cursor position is 
**      still within the table limits. Do the scroll, but do not
**      adjust the cursor position.
**  9-Mar-2009 (kibro01) b121685
**	Add special case when the row being deleted is the only row on the
**	screen, in which case we are also deleting the current top row, so we
**	have to remember where to go next.
