/*{
** Name:	IIFT_fake
**
** Description:
**    This routine is called only by the IBM version of FTrun when
**    the user is trying to add a new row to a table field in 'fill'
**    mode and number of displayed rows (the number of dataset records)
**    is less than the number of physical rows in the table field
**    (i.e.:  tb->tb_display < tb->tb_numrows)
**
**    IIFT_fake simulates the second clause of IIscr_fake, where a new
**    dummy row is added to the bottom of the dataset. (This is necessary
**    so that the IBM version of FT can tell TBACC that a new row
**    has been added *without* returing back using tfscrup.)
**
** Inputs:
**	tbname		Name of the tablefield
**
** Outputs:
**
** Returns:
**
** Exceptions:
**	none
**
** Side Effects:
**
** History:
**	(scl and ncg) Written to correct IBM FT table field
**			     scrolling problem.
