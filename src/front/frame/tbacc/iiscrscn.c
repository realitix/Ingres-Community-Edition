/**
** Name:	iiscrscan.c
**
** Description:
**	Support for a 'SCROLL TO' statement
**
**	Public (extern) routines defined:
**		IIscr_scan()
**	Private (static) routines defined:
**		fix_recnum()
**
** History:
**	08/14/87 (dkh) - ER changes.
**	08/26/87 (dkh) - Changes for 8000 series error numbers.
**	09/01/87 (dkh) - Added explicit include of <frserrno.h>.
**	07/03/88 (dkh) - Fixed problem with scroll commands executed within
**			 an activate scroll block.
**	19-dec-89 (bruceb)
**		Fixed algorithm so no scroll occurs if requested row is
**		already visible.  Also, if requested row is above the top
**		of the visible display, when scrolled into view the row
**		will be displayed at top of TF.  The latter change is in
**		keeping with the result of scrollup/down frs keys.
**
**	06-may-92 (leighb) DeskTop Porting Change:
**		Added IIFDdsrDSRecords routine for use with ScrollBars.
**	01/27/92 (dkh) - Changed the way IIFDdsrDSRecords is set up so that
**			 it is not a link problem for various forms utilities.
**	02/05/92 (dkh) - Updated to handle interface change to IIdisprow().
**	19-mar-93 (fraser)
**		Restored IIFDdsrDSRecords stuff to its original form and
**		ifdef-ed it (on SCROLLBARS) to avoid linking problems.
**		Incorporated some changes in IIFDdsrDSRecords.
**	05/03/93 (dkh) - Changed the name back to IITBdsrDSRecords and
**			 removed the ifdef since this will make the
**			 changes generic regardless of which platform
**			 the code is compiled on.
**	21-mar-94 (smc) Bug #60829
**		Added #include header(s) required to define types passed
**		in prototyped external function calls.
**	15-apr-1997 (cohmi01)
**	    Keep track of ordinal position in dataset. (b81574)
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	26-Aug-2009 (kschendel) b121804
**	    Update prototypes for gcc 4.3.

/*{
** Name:	IIscr_scan	-	Scroll tblfld to target row
**
** Description:
**	Scroll a tablefield dataset to show the specified row.
**
**	An EQUEL '## SCROLL TO' statement will generate a call to this
**	routine.
**
**	If no data set is being used then just set the cursor to the
**	specified row number.
**	If a data set is linked then scan through the data set with
**	record pointer to the top of the final displayed record. Once
**	reaching the specified record number, update another record
**	pointer to the bottom of the display.  Display all the data
**	between these two pointers, and update the current cursor-row
**	to the corresponding row number.
**
**	Update the frame's table field's current row (tf->tfcurrow)
**	to the row number where the record scrolled to is displayed.
**	Update the frame's table field's current column (tf->tfcurcol)
**	to the first column.  This is to make a SCROLL TO similar to
**	a regular SCROLL UP or DOWN, that is triggerred by a cursor
**	movement.
**
** Inputs:
**	tb		Tablefield to scroll
**	recnum		Dataset record number to scroll to
**
** Outputs:
**
** Returns:
**	i4	TRUE
**		FALSE
**
** Exceptions:
**	none
**
** Side Effects:
**
** History:
**	26-apr-1983 	- Written (ncg)
**	18-feb-1987	- Changed rp_rec reference to new rp_data (drh)
**	15-apr-1997 (cohmi01)
**	    Keep track of ordinal position in dataset. (b81574)
