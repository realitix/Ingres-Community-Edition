** Name:	FDgtfldno - Get a field sequence number.
**
** Description:
**	Get the field sequence number.  It is no big deal for
**	updateable fields.  However, for display only fields,
**	we must return the index into the display only chain
**	for the field.
**
** Inputs:
**	mode	Whether to look on updateable (FT_UPDATE) or display
**		only (FT_DISPONLY) chain of fields.
**	frm	Form that contains field.
**	fd	Pointer to the field.
**
** Outputs:
**	regfld	The REGFLD pointer of the field is assigned here.
**	Returns:
**		seqno	The sequence number for the field.
**	Exceptions:
**		None.
**
** Side Effects:
**	None.
**
** History:
**	02/15/87 (dkh) - Added procedure header.
