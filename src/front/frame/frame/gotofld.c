/**
** Name:	gotofld.c - Go to a particular field.
**
** Description:
**	These routines allow an upper level program to move the frame
**	driver to different fields in the frame when a frame interrupts.
**	Routines defined:
**	- FDgotofld - Go to a particular field.
**	- FDgotonext - Continue to the next/previous field.
**	- FDtfsgfix - Fix a table field before leaving it.
**
** History:
**	JEN - 1 Nov 1981  (written)
**	12/23/86 (dkh) - Added support for new activations.
**	24-nov-86 (bruceb)	Fix for b10892
**		Whenever a resume [next | field] is done, check if
**		old field is a table field, and if going to a new
**		field, reset tfcurrow and tfcurcol.  FTtfsgfix()
**		now provides this functionality rather than simply
**		checking for tfcurrow out of bounds.
**	14-jan-87 (bruceb)
**		Reset tfcurrow to 0 if it would otherwise be out
**		of bounds even if resuming to the same table field
**		that user was in prior to the activate.
**	02/15/87 (dkh) - Added header.
**	05/19/89 (dkh) - Fixed bug 5398.
**	18-apr-90 (bruceb)
**		Lint changes; FDtfsgfix now has 2 instead of 3 args.
**	01/12/91 (dkh) - Fixed bug 35327.
**	08/11/91 (dkh) - Added change to prevent alerter events from
**			 being triggered when no menuitems were selected
**			 or in between a column/scroll activation combination.
**  17-jun-97 (rodjo04) -Fixed bug 83098
**     Added check to FDtfsgfix() to see if we are currently scrolling.   
**     If so then don't change current row value. 
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4

** Name:	FDgotofld - Go to a field.
**
** Description:
**	Given a form and a field name, find the field in the
**	form and make it the current field.  Before changing
**	the current field, check to see if the old current field
**	is a table field.  If it is check to make sure the
**	current row and column are valid for the table field.
**	This is all done by FDtfsgfix().
**
** Inputs:
**	frm	Form that contains field.

**
** Outputs:
**	Returns:
**		TRUE	If field exists in the form.
**		FALSE	If field does not exist in form.

** Side Effects:
**	If the old current field was a table field, the current
**	row and column for it may be changed.

**
** Description:
**	A resume next request is only valid from an activate

**	activate to occur.  The commands that are handled
**	here are the nextfield, previousfield, downline and

**	and frskey selection is handled in the RUNTIME layer.
**	A new current field is set at the end of this
**	routine, by FDmove().
**
** Inputs:
**	frm	Form to process the continuation on.
**	evcb	An event control block providing the
**		command to continue with.
**
** Outputs:
**	Returns:
**		None.
**	Exceptions:
**		None.
**
** Side Effects:
**	Can cause an activate scroll to be raised if the
**	continuation is a downline at the bottom of a
**	table field or an upline at the top of one.
