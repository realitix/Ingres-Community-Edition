/*{
** Name:	IIFDaeAlerterEvent - Check for an (alerter) event.
**
** Description:
**	This routine simply checks for an (alerter) event by running
**	a "get event" statement.  If one is found, it returns TRUE,
**	FALSE otherwsie.
**
**	Side effects of this routine is that it will de-queue the
**	(alerter) event so that the user must use inquire_frs to
**	find out the specifics.  This routine also stores away the
**	various values of the event to allow the application to
**	inquire about the event later on.
**
** Inputs:
**	None.
**
** Outputs:
**
**	Returns:
**		TRUE	If an (alerter) event found.
**		FALSE	If no (alerter) event found.
**	Exceptions:
**		None.
**
** Side Effects:
**	None other than that listed above.
