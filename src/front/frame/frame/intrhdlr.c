/*{
** Name:	FDhandler - Exception handler for front ends.
**
** Description:
**	This routine is the exception handler for forms based
**	front ends.  It is called when one of our
**	frontends is interrupted (ie - a user
**	types cntrl-C to exit or some other interrupt
**	character).  It moves the cursor to the bottom
**	of the screen and uses TErestore() to exit
**	gracefully.  The terminal will not be left in
**	a weird state (like raw mode) if this routine
**	is used to handle interrupts.  To use this routine
**	the following call was put in the main() routine
**	of the frontends:
**		EXdeclare(FDhandler, &context);
**	Exceptions that this routine handles are:
**	- Interrupt
**	- Kill
**	- Quit
**	- Out of input
**	- Bus error (AV on VMS)
**	- Segmentation violation (AV on VMS)
**
** Inputs:
**	ex	Exception arguments to process.
**
** Outputs:
**	Returns:
**		EXRESIGNAL	To resignal the exception for someone
**				else to handle if it does not want
**				to handle it.
**	Exceptions:
**		None.
**
** Side Effects:
**	The process will exit if the exception is handled here.
**
** History:
**	??/??/?? (dkh) - Initial version.
**	Added 6/20/83  (nml)
**	Modified 10/27/83 (nml) Put in call to INcleanup() to fix bug #1629.
**	02/15/87 (dkh) - Added procedure header.
**	07/22/87 (dkh) - Fix for jup bug 552.  Now resets terminal when
**			 EXBUSERR and EXSEGVIO is found.
