**	FDcopyup(tbl, from, to)
**
** History:
**	30-apr-1984	Improved interface to routines for performance (ncg)
**	02/08/87 (dkh) - Added support for ADTs.
**	08/26/87 (dkh) - Changes for 8000 series error numbers.
**	09/01/87 (dkh) - Added change bit for datasets.
**	09/16/87 (dkh) - Integrated table field change bit.
**	12/23/87 (dkh) - Performance changes.
**	02/01/88 (dkh) - Fixed jup bug 1905.
**	07/26/90 (dkh) - Added support for table field cell highlighting.
**	21-mar-94 (smc) Bug #60829
**		Added #include header(s) required to define types passed
**		in prototyped external function calls.
**      02-apr-97 (cohmi01)
**	    Add FDmoverows() to accomodate block mode scrolling for bug 73587.
**	    Add 'skip' parm to FDdocopy() to allow for shift of >1 row.
**	05-may-97 (cohmi01)
**	    To improve single line scroll response with UPFRONT, try
**	    to send X131 msg if available. (73587).
**	01-aug-97 (kitch01)
**		Bug 83988. The above change did not update the displayed rows array.
**		This could cause "phantom" updates as this array is now out of step
**		with what is actually displayed. Moved the sending of X131 to FDdocopy.
**	09-dec-97 (kitch01)
**		Bug 87666. Re-instate the sending of X131 to FDmoverows. FDmoverows is called
**		only when we are scrolling the DS. FDdocopy can be called when inserting/deleting
**		rows and under certain circumstances would send X131. This caused bug 87666. Amended
**		the interface to FDdocopy to prevent old scrolling method if X131 was sent.
**	
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	26-Aug-2009 (kschendel) b121804
**	    Remove function defns now in headers.

** Name:        FDmoverows - Move a block of rows up/down n rows.
**
** Description:
** 	Similar to FDcopydown/FDcopyup except that the move may
**	be to a target position more than one row away from the
**	origin. Uses new 'skip' parm added to FDdocopy.
**
** Inputs:
**
**	tbl		Tablefield info
**	from		Start of block of rows (0 based)
**	to		One more than 0 based last row number of block.
**	skip		# of rows to augment the usual 1 row shift done
**			by FDdocopy().
** Outputs:
**      Returns:
**              None.

**	01-aug-97 (kitch01)
**		Bug 83988. Placing X131 message (for Upfront) here causes "phantom"
**		updates of the database (should the app allow updates). This is because
**		the displayed rows array is not updated here.
**  11-nov-1997 (rodjo04)
**      In FDdocopy(), before issueing a X131, we should check to see if we
**      need to scroll. A check for (skip == 0) is no longer enough.
**	08-dec-1997 (kitch01)
**		Re-instated the call for sending X131 to upfront.
