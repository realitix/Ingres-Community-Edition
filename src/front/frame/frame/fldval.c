**  History:	19-nov-85 (mgw) bug # 6599
**			This routine is called with 6 args, so I added disponly
**			as per "The FD and FT Interface" design spec in spite of
**			the fact that Marian and Dave H. already fixed this bug
**			by disallowing ^A's (auto dup) on table fields in
**			FTinsert().
**	03/05/87 (dkh) - Added support for ADTs.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
