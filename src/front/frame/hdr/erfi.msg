**		this because 6.4 uses a new message file format.  NOTE:
**		the '%0c' in these msgs refers to strings in the erfd.msg
**		file.  Common usage is "... the %0c", where %0c is replaced
**		by "current field", "field (title: Address, internal name:

**			 in the code.

 **      The character given in II_APP_DECIMAL is not a valid decimal point
 **      character.  This is the character you have used in field validation 
 **      statements to specify numeric literals that can have a fractional part,
 **      such as money values or real numbers.  Valid decimal point characters
 **      are `.' or `,'.  Important note: this logical symbol is provided
 **      only for backward compatibility.  It is recommended that you use
 **      a decimal point character of `.' in your field validation code,
 **      and leave II_APP_DECIMAL unset (it will default to `.').
 **
 ** System Status:
 **      The ABF compiler will assume that your field validation statements 
 **	will use a decimal point character of `.' to specify the fractional 
 **	parts of numeric literals.  If your field validation statements in 
 **	fact use some other character, a syntax error will be reported.
 **
 ** User Action:
 **      Set a valid single-character string for the II_APP_DECIMAL name.
