/**
** Name:	frmindex.h -	Form Index File Module Definitions File.
**
** Description:
**	Contains the definition of the structures that make up a Form Index
**	file and its class definition.  A Form Index file consist of an index
**	followed by a header and the encoded form structure for each form.
**
**	NOTE:  THE FORM INDEX FILE IS SYSTEM-DEPENDENT.  (Since
**	the encoded form structures are system-dependent.)
**
**	Defines:
**
**	FORM_INDEX	form index file class definition.
**	INDEX		form index file header and index table definition.
**	INDEX_HDR	form index file header definition.
**	INDEX_ENTRY	form index file index table entry definition.
**	FORM_HDR	form index file encoded form header.
**
** History:
**	Revision 6.1  88/03/30  wong
**	Initial revision of this interface.
**
**	Revision 6.0  87/09/10  peter
**	Change index page to contain size parameter as well for version "6.01".
**
**	Revision 5.0K  86/12/20  Kobayashi
**	Initial implementation for 5.0 Kanji.
**
**	11-apr-1989 (mgw)
**		Increased MAXINDEX to 170 to accomodate more forms in the
**		forms file.
**	04-jan-1990 (mgw)
**		Increased MAXINDEX to 284 to accomodate more forms in the
**		forms file.
**	04/16/91 (dkh) - Added support to handle different formindex
**			 file header sizes.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
