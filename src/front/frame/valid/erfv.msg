"Internal error in datatype facility.\n  An internal error occurred
while checking datatype compatibility in the validation string.  This
may indicate that the datatype manipulation facility has been corrupted.
Please write down circumstances that led to the error
and report it to your Site Technical Contact.
If this error occurred while trying to save a form in VIFRED, then you
will be afforded the chance to change the validation string.  For the
case where a form is being initialized for use in an application
the form will not be initialized and one may need to restart the
application."
