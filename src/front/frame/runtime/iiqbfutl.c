** Name:	iiqbf.c - Special routines for use for QBF.

** Copyright (c) 2004 Actian Corporation
**
** Description:
**	This file contains special routines for use by QBF to changed
**	the mode of a form without causing a redisplay and a high
**	level interface for range query support.  The use of the latter
**	feature may be in the following way.
**
**	Set up a form for using range query with
**		IIrnginit()
**	Take away range query for a form with
**		IIrngend()
**	Suspend range query capability for a form with
**		IIunrung()
**	Reenable range query capability for a form with
**		IIrngon()
**	Prepare to unload range queries on form with
**		IIrgetinit()
**	Unload range query and build qualification clause by doing
**		{ Check syntax, etc. for fields}
**		IIrvalid()
**		{ Unload a regular field }
**		IIrngget()
**		{ Unload a table field }
**		while (IIrnxtrow())
**		{
**			...
**			IIrngget()
**			...
**		}
**	Get the last query entered by calling
**		IIrnglast()
**
**  History:
**
**	Created - 08/24/85 (dkh)
**	02/12/87 (dkh) - Added headers.
**	5-jan-1987 (peter)	Changed RTfndcol to FDfndcol.
**	27-mar-1987	Modified IIrngget for new QG interface, ADTs, 
**			NULLs (drh)
**	5-may-1987 (Joe)
**		Modified IIrngget to use the newer QG interface.  Now
**		it calls a function to send down the QRYSPECs built.
**	11-sep-87 (bab)
**		Changed cast in call to FDfind from char** to nat**.
**	09-dec-87 (kenl)
**		Changed IIrvalid so that it is passed (and passes on) two more
**		parameters, a function pointer and a structure pointer.  This
**		is needed for QBF to properly build the FROM clause so QG can
**		read a Master row for a Master/Detail JoinDef.
**	02/24/88 (dkh) - Fixed jup bug 2083.
**	05/27/88 (dkh) - Added user support for scrollable fields.
**	23-aug-88 (kenl)
**		Changed IIrvalid so that it is passed (and passes on) one
**		more parameter, the DML being spoken.  This is required
**		by the validity routines farther down the line in order
**		to know if we are talking to a gateway.
**	12/31/88 (dkh) - Perf changes.
**      24-sep-96 (hanch04)
**              Global data moved to data.c
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	18-Aug-2009 (kschendel) 121804
**	    Update some of the function declarations to fix gcc 4.3 problems.

**	Routine gets the range query for the specified field and
**	builds part of a where qualification clause for the
**	field.  No row number is necessary since we are always
**	unloading from the "current" row which has already been
**	set up by a call to IIrnxtrow().
**
**	The routine gets a pointer to the DB_LTXT_TYPE displayed field value, 
**	and parses that value, building several query specifications
**	based on the field content.  Multiple specifications may be
**	specified using 'and', 'or', and parentheses.  The default
**	query operator for each specification is '=', although others
**	are allowed when entered explicitly.  
**
**	The actual data values in the qualfication are converted to their
**	internal representation, using the field's format and datatype.
**	The DB_DATA_VALUE for the internal field value and become part of
**	the list of QRY_SPECs.  The textual parts of the qualfication
**	(i.e. 'and', 'or', query operators, table and column names)
**	are stored in the QRY_SPEC array as QS_TEXT type specifications.
**
**	Each QRY_SPEC in the list is passed to argument func for processing
**	as it is built.
**
**	WARNING:  This routine relies on other FT routines that manipulate
**	'scrollable' fields.  It should be called only by QBF, in the
**	context of those other FT routines.  See bldwhere.qc in QBF,
**	and iiqbf.c in RUNTIME for the details.
**
** Inputs:
**	fieldname	Name of field.
**	colname		Name of column if field is a table field.
**	dbtblname	Database table name for use in building qualification
**			clause.
**	dbcolname	Database column name for use in building qualifcation
**			clause.
**	dml_level		{nat}  DML compatiblity, UI_DML_QUEL, etc.	
**				(Passed through to 'FDrngchk()'.)
**
**	prefix		A text string to send before any other
**			QRY_SPEC.  If NULL don't send.
**
**	func		A function to call foreach QRY_SPEC.
**
**	func_param	A parameter to pass to the function given by func.
** Outputs:
**	Returns:
**		OK	If qualification clause was successfully built.
**		QG_NOSPEC
**			If no QRY_SPEC where generated for the field.
**		!= OK	If clause could not be built due to syntax error,
**			bad value conversion or specified field does not
**			exist.
