/*{
** Name:	IIvalfld	-	Validate a field
**
** Description:
**	A call to this routine is generated by a "##VALIDATE FIELD"
**	statement.
**
**	Uses the name of the field provided by the caller, assumes it
**	is in the currently displayed form.  Actual validation is
**	done differently depending on the 'mode' of the form (i.e.
**	query mode is special).
**
**	This routine is part of RUNTIME's external interface.
**	
** Inputs:
**	strvar		Name of the field to validate
**
** Outputs:
**
** Returns:
**	i4	TRUE
**		FALSE
**
** Exceptions:
**	none
**
** Example and Code Generation:
**	## validate field f1
**
**	if (IIvalfld("f1") == 0) goto IIfdBegin1;
