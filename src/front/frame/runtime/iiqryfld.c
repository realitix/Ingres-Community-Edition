/*{
** Name:	IIqryfield	-	Get data from query mode field
**
** Description:
**	Provided with a field in QUERY mode, build a qualification
**	specification for the field that can be used in a WHERE clause.  
**	Only one qualfication is allowed per field.
**
**	This supports QBF query mode in all instances (i.e. the PC
**	product) where scrolling fields in QBF queries are not supported. 
**
**	The query specification built by this routine is designed for
**	the 6.0 Query Generator module interface.  It builds several QRY_SPEC
**	passing each to the argument qgfunc.
**
**	The real work is node by FDrngchk.
**
**	WARNING:  This routine is for QBF use ONLY.
**
** Inputs:
**	name		Name of the field
**
**	relname		The relation name to use for the claue.
**
**	attrname	The attribute name for the field's query.
**
**	dml_level	{nat}  DML compatibility level, UI_DML_QUEL, etc.
**				(Passed through to 'FDrngchk()'.)
**
**	prefix		A string to put out before an clause is put
**			out.
**
**	qgfunc		The function to call for each QRY_SPEC built.
**
**	qgvalue		A value to pass to qgfunc.
**
** Returns:
**		OK if succeeded and some QRY_SPECs were sent.
**		QG_NOSPEC if no QRY_SPECs were sent
**		not OK otherwise.
**
** Exceptions:
**	none
**
** Side Effects:
**
** History:
**	27-mar-1987	Modified parameters, changed for ADTs and NULLs.
**			Eliminated IIqrybuf routine (drh).
**	14-may-1987 (Joe)
**		Changed to use qgfunc, and now puts relname.attrname.
**
