/*{
** Name:	IIFRreResEntry	- Like a 'resume to current' but with EA.
**
** Description:
**	Set up for an entry activation on return to the current field
**	on the form.  This is essentially nothing more than a
**	'## resume' (no-op) with a request for EA tossed in.
**	This is entirely a no-op if called from in a (non-display)
**	submenu.  Work is done by setting the record of 'last field
**	cursor was in' to a BADFLDNO.
**
** Inputs:
**
** Outputs:
**
** Returns:
**	VOID
**
** Exceptions:
**	none
**
** Example and Code Generation:
**	## resume entry
**
*	{
**	    IIFRreResEntry();
**	    if (1) goto IIfdB1;
**	}
**
** Side Effects:
**
** History:
**	23-mar-89 (bruceb)	Written.
