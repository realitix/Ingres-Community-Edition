** Description:

** History:
**	22-feb-1983  -  Extracted from original runtime.c (jen)
**	25-mar-1983  -	Modified to clear table fields. (ncg)
**	08/11/91 (dkh) - Passed FRAME pointer to IITBtclr() so that clearing
**			 a table field will clear out dataset attributes
**			 from the table field cells holding area as well.
**	03/01/92 (dkh) - Renamed IItclr() to IITBtclr() to avoid name
**			 space conflicts with eqf generated symbols.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
