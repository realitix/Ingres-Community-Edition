@REM  Description:
@REM 	Sets a command enviroment variable to the input entered from a console. 
@REM    Executes ipreadp which reads a line from standard input and writes
@REM  	it to standard output. This gets piped to ipsetp which will construct
@REM    a MS-DOS set variable command and pipe that command to standard output.
@REM    Next the set command is redirected to a temporary batch file which 
@REM  	will be executed and deleted(in that order).
