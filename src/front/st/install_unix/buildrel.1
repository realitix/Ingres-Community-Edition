.SH NAME
buildrel \- copy a build area to a release area
.SH ORIGIN
Actian Corporation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B buildrel
[ options ] [ release-directory ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Buildrel
creates a release area from a build area.  A release area is defined
to be a directory structure on disk from which a release medium can
be made by copying with a standard archive program, e.g.
.B tar.
.PP
.I Buildrel
also creates the distribution version of the Manifest file.  The distribution
version differs from the version that appears in the source tree in a couple
of respects.  It contains no comments; it is completely self-contained (that
is, the packages and parts are described directly instead of in separate
files); it contains checksums and sizes for each file in the distribution.
All processing required to create a distribution manifest is carried out
by
.I buildrel.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -a
Audit; just generate a list of bad files (missing or wrong permissions), but
don't move anything or update anything.
.TP
.BI -l " logfile"
Specify the name of a log file.  The file is actually created by the
.B tar
commands which move files onto the release area; the specified file will
contain a log of all files moved by
.B tar,
in tar's ``verbose'' format.
.TP
.B -M
Update the manifest file, but don't move any files to the release area.  This
option requires that the release area already exist; it may be used when
the only change required is to the file sizes or checksums, for example.
.TP
.B -n
No questions; generate all the usual output, but assume default answers
to all questions.
.TP
.BI -p " pkgname"
Specify a single package to move.  This option requires that the release
area already exist.  The specified package is moved onto the release
area, and the manifest file is updated.
.TP
.B -s
Silent running.  Generate no -- well, very little -- output, and don't
ask any questions.  This option subsumes the -n option.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B Build area
If the environment variable
.B ING_BUILD
is set, its value is used as the location of the build area.  If it is not
set, then the directory
.B ingres
under the path specified as the value of
.B II_SYSTEM
is used as the location of the build area.  If
.B II_SYSTEM
is not set, an error message is generated and the program exits.
.TP
.B Release area
The location of the release area may be specified as the last parameter
on the command line.  If it is not specified on the command line, the value of
.B RELDIR
is used as the location of the release area.  If no relase area is
specified and
.B RELDIR
is not set, the program exits with an error message.
.SH FILES
.TP
.B Manifest.ing
The source manifest file; this is the main file which drives the process.
.TP
.B *.prt
On the source tree, each ``part'' of the Ingres distribution is described
in a separate file.
.SH BUGS
The ``usage'' message, generated as the result of an error on the
command line, is pretty lame.
.PP
It would be nice if there were some way of directing the list of bad
files (missing or wrong permission) into a file.  Failing that, it would
be nice if there were some way to make the list pause at the end of
every screenfull.
