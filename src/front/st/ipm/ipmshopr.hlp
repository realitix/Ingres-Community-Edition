You are viewing the Process Information screen.  This screen displays detailed
job/process information on the indicated process (usually an Ingres server).
This screen can also be invoked from the Logging area of IPM.  In that
case, the information displayed could be for a server, recovery process or
an archiver.  When this screen is invoked from the Session List screen,
the front end (or client) process information is displayed.  This will
only work when front end is local and interactive.

This feature is available only on VMS.

Place the cursor on the process you want displayed from the Server List,
Log Process Display, or Log Transaction Display.

By examining the Detailed Process Information screen, you may determine
if the quotas are adequate for the account that started this Ingres process.

The display is automatically refreshed.  The "Display Refresh" field on
the Options Display screen does not affect the refresh time of this screen.

Displayed information includes:

Process State      The VMS process state.

CPU Time           Cumulative CPU time.  
	
Lock Enqueue Info  The important value is the Remaining field.  When this
                   value reaches zero, it means that the server can't
                   acquire any more locks.  This could lead to Ingres errors
                   and/or lock escalation (which implies table level
                   locking).  Lock escalation can cause serious concurrency
                   problems.  This is a concern for Ingres installations on
                   VAXClusters where Ingres uses the VMS Distributed Lock
                   Manager (DLM).

Direct I/O Info    The Total field shows how many cumulative direct I/O
                   requests were made.  This indicates how much disk I/O
                   is being performed.

Open File Info     The Remaining field shows how many more files
                   the process can open.  On queries which touch many
                   tables, on databases with journals and queries which
                   contain aggregates, the File Limit Quota (FILLM) can be
                   exceeded if not set at recommended levels (see the Ingres
                   Installation Guide).

Page Faults        Indicates if the working set sizes (also displayed)
                   are sufficient.

When the process which is being monitored is deleted, an appropriate
message is displayed in the upper left corner of the form.  At any time, the
current screen can be written to a file for later analysis.  This display
is very useful for observing servers which are running large queries, MQTs
(Multi Query Transactions) or users to ensure that there are sufficient
OS resources.  For more information on JPI parameters, please reference
the VMS System Services Manual, information on SYS$GETJPI system call.

The following menuitems are available:

Print_Screen  Captures the current screen's contents.   This stops the
              screen refresh while writing the screen out.  When the
              screen is written to the file, the screen refresh resumes.

Help          Displays this screen.

End           Returns to the previous screen.

Quit          Exits IPM.
