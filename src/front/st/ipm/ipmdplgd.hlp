You are viewing the Log Database Display screen.  This screen contains an entry
for each active database.  This allows you to monitor logging activity
by database.  Information includes the number of transaction begins and
ends as well as the number of log file write requests.  Based on this
information, you can spot databases with large amounts of logging activity.

The status of a database can also be determined.  See the information on
the "Status" field for a list of valid status values.

Columns on this screen include:

    DB Name        The database name.

    Status         The database status.  Valid statuses are:

                   NOTDB          The entry is not a database.

                   FAST_COMMIT    This database is running with Fast Commit.
