You are viewing the Lock Summary screen.  This screen displays various pieces of
information from the Ingres locking system.  By viewing the data on this
screen, you may determine which locking parameters need to be adjusted.
Currently, there is no way to view from IPM all of the locking parameters
used to configure the Ingres locking system.  Those parameters should be
kept in a handy place when viewing this screen.

This screen will autorefresh the information if the -r flag was specified at
startup or the "Display Refresh" field on the Option Selection screen was
changed to a number between 1 and 999 seconds.  Autorefresh is desirable
when monitoring this information.

When tests or benchmarks are being run it may be desirable to monitor the
locking system activity during the test.  If you select the "Interval"
menuitem and then the "Start_Now" menuitem, IPM will display the statistics
accumulated since the start time.  In addition, if the Interval option was
not previously enabled, the start time and current time fields appear in the
upper right hand corner of the Locking System Summary screen.  To reset the
start time (which is the time when the "Start_Now" menuitem is selected),
select the "Interval" menuitem followed by the "Start_Now" menuitem.

The start time and statistics obtained at the start time will remain
unchanged until the "Begin_Now" or "Since_Startup" menuitems are selected or
the user exits IPM.  This allows other IPM functions (e.g. logging, other
locking or server information) to be used while accumulating statistics.
When the Locking System Summary screen is displayed at a later time,
the running totals since the start time are not lost.

When displaying statistics over an interval, the "autorefresh" option
should be set.  This causes the display to be automatically updated.

When this screen is displayed on VAXcluster installations of Ingres,
additional fields are displayed.

Fields of particular interest are the quantities of locks/lock lists
remaining, in use and total available.  By observing these fields, you
may spot conditions when more locking system resources need to be made
available by reconfiguring the locking system (via rcpconfig, see the
Ingres Installation and Operations guide).

Fields on this screen include:

Create         The number of times a lock list was created on behalf of a
lock list      server, session or transaction.

Release        The number of times a release of a lock list occurred on
lock list      behalf of a server, session or transaction.

Request lock   The number of new lock requests that the Ingres locking
               system processed.

Re-request     The number of times an implicit lock conversion request was
lock           issued on a resource that the lock list already had locked.
               Implicit lock conversions can occur when a request is made
               on a page for update that was previously requested for read.

Convert Lock   The number of times an explicit lock conversion request is
               made to change a lock mode on a physical lock from one mode
               to another.  These types of requests occur as a result of a
               physical lock being converted during an existing transaction
               to lower or higher modes.

Release Lock   The number of times a specific logical lock is released, as
               opposed to a full, partial, or physical lock release.

Escalate       The number of times a partial release occurred to allow
               escalation of lock granularity from page to table level.

Lock Wait      The number of times a new lock request had to wait to be
               granted.

Convert Wait   The number of times an existing lock waited for conversion
               to a different lock mode.

Convert        The number of times a request for conversion turned into a
deadlock       deadlock.

Deadlock       The number of times a deadlock search was initiated.
search

Deadlock       The number of times that deadlock occurred.

Cancel         The number of times a lock request was cancelled due to a
               timeout or interrupt.

The following fields appear only in VAXcluster installations (below the
"--Global Locking Information--" label on the screen:

Enqueue        The number of times the VMS lock manager was called to map
               Ingres locks onto their VMS counterparts through the use of
               VMS system calls.

Dequeue        The number of times the VMS lock manager was called to dequeue
               VMS locks using VMS system calls that occurred as a result of
               a change in status of the corresponding Ingres lock.

Dlck search    The number of pending global deadlock search requests.
pending

Deadlock       The number of global deadlocks that occurred.

Lock grant     The number of global locks that were granted without
before srch    contention as a result of the lock request.

Dlck search    The number of times a global deadlock search was initiated
requests

Dlck search    The number of times the Cluster Server Process (CSP)
calls          requested deadlock search information.

Dlck messages  The number of times a global deadlock message was built up
sent           and sent.

Con't dlck     The number of times a continue global deadlock search
srch calls     request was issued in response to an unresolved global
               contention problem.

Con't dlck     The number of continue global deadlock search messages that
msgs sent      were sent due to an unresolved global contention problem.

Unsent dlck    The number of unsent global deadlock search messages found.
srch rqsts

Sent all dlck  The number of times that global deadlock search requests
srch rqsts     were more than 50% of the total number of transactions.


Menuitems available on this screen include:

Refresh        Queries the Ingres locking system for locking summary
               information.  Even if the autorefresh option is set,
               this menuitem can still be selected at any time.

Interval       Displays a submenu which allows a start time to be set
               be set to begin measuring locking summary information.
               This allows display of summary information that occurred
               since the selected start time.  Otherwise, the information
               displayed is activity since the Ingres locking system was
               started.  Choices available from the submenu are:

               Since_Startup  Displays summary information since system
                              startup.  This is the default.  If the Interval
                              option was enabled, the start and current time
                              fields disappear.

               Begin_Now      Enables the Interval option.  Clears all values
                              from the screen and displays the start time and
                              current time fields.  The next refresh of the
                              summary information will cause the activity
                              since the start time to be displayed.  The start
                              time and summary information at the start time
                              are maintained until the "Since_Startup"
                              menuitem is selected or "Begin_Now" is selected
                              again.

               End            Returns to the previous menu.

Help           Displays this screen.

End            Returns to the Lock Info Menu screen.

Quit           Exits IPM.
