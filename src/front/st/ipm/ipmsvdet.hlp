You are viewing the Server Detail screen.  This screen displays information
about the indicated server (the one that the cursor was placed on in the
Server List screen).  Information displayed includes:

Current total sessions   the number of users currently connected to the
                         indicated server.

Max total Sessions       the maximum number of users that the indicated
                         server can handle at any one time. 

Active current sessions  the number of sessions in a computable state.
                         The active_sessions server parameter currently
                         has no effect on the number of computable sessions
                         allowed at any one time.  The server does not
                         currently provide a count of the number of active
                         transactions; therefore this number is always 0.

Active maximum sessions  the maximum number of user sessions that can
                         be in a computable state.

The maximum and active maximum sessions are determined at server startup.
See the Ingres Installation Guide for more information on server 
parameters.

The amount of CPU used is displayed in terms of Quantum, the basic time
slice used by the server.  The first number represents the number of
idle quantums, the second is the number of quantums since server startup.
This applies to VMS only.

The Name, Type, and Connecting To fields are repeated from the Server
List screen.  If there are many databases or long database names, they
will be displayed in full on this screen.

Menuitems available on this screen include:

Refresh        Queries the specified Ingres server for server detail
               information.  If the specified server no longer exists,
               a message is displayed.  

Help           Displays this screen.

End            Returns to the Server List screen.

Quit           Exits IPM.
