You are viewing the Session List screen.  This screen displays all of the user
sessions connected to the indicated server (the server that the cursor
rested on).  For each session, IPM displays the session id, name, terminal
if known, database connected to, session state, server facility, and query.

Name           The name of the session.  Ingres internal sessions are
               displayed with angle brackets "<>" as shown.  This is a
               scrollable field; move the cursor to the field and use the
               arrow keys to see the entire contents.  Session names for
               user sessions are usually the same as the username.  (Both
               the username and session name are shown under More_Info.)

State          The state of the session.  COM means the session is
               computable; it is not waiting for the user or for I/O.
               LOG-IO means the session is waiting for output to the
               logfile.  (This, as well as other states, are not identical
               in meaning for internal sessions, such as the Fast Commit
               Thread).  DIO means the session is waiting for disk I/O.
               BIO means the session is waiting for client [frontend]
               communications.  LOCK means the session is waiting for
               another session to release locks.  Use the Find menuitem to
               search this column.

TTY            The terminal name, if known.  Network and internal sessions
               don't show a terminal.

Database       The database that the session is currently connected to.

Facil          The server facility that the session is currently in.  QEF
               is the Query Execution Facility.  Other facilities include
               DMF, the data manipulation facility, OPF and the optimizer
               facility.  The More_Info screen spells out the meaning of
               the facility acronym.

Query          If the user running IPM is an Ingres superuser, the query is
               shown.  The More_Info screen shows more of the query.  The
               query is only shown if it is current.  A current query is
               one being processed by the DBMS, not a query that has
               returned results and finished executing, even though the
               user has not committed.

The Session List screen has the following menuitems:

More_Info      Displays the Session Detail screen.  This screen displays
               information about the indicated session (the one the cursor
               was placed on).

DBA_Operations Displays a submenu which allows an Ingres superuser to
               delete the session on which the cursor is placed.  Do NOT
               remove Ingres internal sessions (marked with <>).

Refresh        Queries the specified Ingres server for a list of sessions
               and refreshes the display.  If the server no longer
               exists, a message is printed.

Find           Searches for matching values in any column in the scrolling
               area.  <TAB> to the desired column, then select "Find".
               You can use this, for instance, to search for LOCK in the
               State column.

Help           Displays this screen.

End            Returns to the Server List screen.

Quit           Exits IPM.
