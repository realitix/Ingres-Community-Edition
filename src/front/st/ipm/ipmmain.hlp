You are viewing the main menu screen of IPM.  From here you can view information
on servers, locking and logging.  Select the Options menuitem to change
overall settings that affect display of all information.  Use the up/down
arrow keys to place the cursor on your choice, then press the "Select" key.

The following choices are available:

Server List    Displays the registered servers currently running in your
               Ingres installation.  From here you can view sessions of each
               server, display what users are connected to which databases,
               and so on.  If you are an Ingres superuser, you can remove
               individual sessions and shutdown DBMS or STAR servers.

               The server list is not available in standalone mode (the
               -s option).

Lock Info      Presents a menu pertaining to the Ingres locking system.
               Choices from this menu will display locking system summaries,
               lock lists, and locked resources (databases, tables, pages).
               This is where concurrency analysis may be performed.

Log Info       Presents a menu pertaining to the Ingres logging system.
               Choices from this menu will display logging system summaries,
               transaction lists, process and database lists.  This is where
               transaction rates and transaction log file activity may be
               monitored.

The following menuitems are available:

Select         Selects the indicated choice (Server List, Lock Info, or
               Log Info.)

Options        Presents a menu which allows you to view or set options.
               Most options affect how much information IPM will display.
               For instance, one option allows you to limit display of lock
               resources to those for a specific database.  IPM provides
               popup help for each option, listing available choices.

Help           Displays this screen.

Quit           Exits IPM.
