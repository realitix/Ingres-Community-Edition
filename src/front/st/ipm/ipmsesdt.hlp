You are viewing the Session Detail screen.  This screen displays a variety of
information about the indicated user session.  Session ID, Session Name,
Terminal, Database, and Server Facility are the same as on the Session
List screen.  State is replaced by the expanded state and mask; this
information is mainly of use to consultants.

Other fields on the session detail screen include:

Real User,     Usually these are identical.  If the session was started
Apparent User  with the -u flag to impersonate another user, the apparent
               user is the user who is being impersonated.  For instance,
               if user ted used his Ingres superuser privileges to start a
               session with "sql -u bill dbname", then the apparent user would
               be bill, the real user would be ted.

DBA            The owner of the database (Database Administrator) that the
               session is connected to.

Group ID,      The group and role ID (part of the optional Knowledge
Role ID        Management Extension package), if any, are displayed for the
               current session.

Query          If the user running IPM is an Ingres superuser, the first
               128 characters of the query currently running are displayed.
               The query is only shown if it is current.  A current query
               is one being processed by the DBMS, not a query that has
               returned results and finished executing, even though the
               user has not committed.

Client PID     On VMS only, if the session is being run from a front end
               which is local and interactive (as opposed to batch), the
               front end's Process ID (PID) is displayed.  Using the
               "Process_Info" menuitem, the front end Job and Process (JPI)
               parameters can be observed using the IPM Detailed Process
               Information screen.

Log records    When the session is backing out the transaction due to any
processed,     cause, the number of log records processed and the log
Current log    address being processed in the process of the rollout will
address        be displayed.  This allows visual confirmation that the
               server is indeed doing work on the rollout.  Periodic
               refreshes gives a measure of the progress in performing the
               rollout.  A session which is being rolled out should never
               be removed nor should the server containing that session be
               terminated in any way.  Causes of backing out include the
               ROLLBACK statement in SQL, the session being removed, running
               out of logfile space, and deadlock.

Activity       The Activity field indicates the various states a session
               may be in.  The possible states include:

               Aborting
                    A normal abort is being performed (i.e. user issued a
                    ROLLBACK, deadlock, etc).

               Performing force abort processing
                    An abort of an old transaction is underway.

               Aborting on behalf of an interrupt
                    An abort is taking place due to an interrupt (Control-C).

               Aborting on behalf of a terminating session
                    An abort is taking place for a session which is
                    terminating ungracefully.

               Terminating session
                    A session is terminating normally.

               Fetching IIDBDB information
                    A session that is starting up is retrieving IIDBDB
                    information.  This can show up for extended periods due
                    to locks on the IIDBDB or the logging system is full.

               Optimizing query
                    The optimizer is at work.

               Waiting on event lock signal (LKevent)
                    The Event Thread is usually in this state.

The following menuitems are available:

Refresh        Queries the specified Ingres server for new session detail
               for the specified session and refreshes the display.  If the
               server and/or session no longer exists, a message is
               displayed.

Process_Info   Displays a screen which shows various job-process
               information for the front end which is being examined.  The
               front end must be local and interactive (not in batch) in
               order for this option to work: a PID can't be obtained for a
               session's front end unless the front end is "tied to" a
               terminal.  Information displayed includes CPU time, Direct
               I/O, Buffered I/O, Enqueue limit, etc.  This display
               automatically refreshes.  This menuitem is available on
               VMS only.

Help           Displays this screen.

End            Returns to the Session List screen.

Quit           Exits IPM.
