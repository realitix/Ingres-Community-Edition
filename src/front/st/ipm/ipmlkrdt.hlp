You are viewing the Lock Detail Display screen.  This screen contains all
the locks held on the specified resource.  The number of locks held on
a resource indicates the amount of concurrent activity and points to
potential concurrency bottlenecks.

Fields on this screen include:

ID             The internal lock identifier for this lock.

List ID        The internal lock list identifier that this lock belongs to.

Session        The name of the session that this lock belongs to.

RQ             The mode the lock was requested in.  The possible modes are:

               S     Shared - used when reading.

               IS    Intended shared - for table resource types, this means
                     that there are shared page resources in this table.

               X     Exclusive - used when writing.

               IX    Intended exclusive - same as intended shared except pages
                     are exclusively locked.

               N     Null - used to keep a lock without causing locking
                     contention.  It's less expensive to convert a lock than
                     to drop and request a new lock.

               SIX   Shared with intent to update.  Used with ESQL cursors.

State          Current state of lock (GR = granted, WT = waiting)

Menuitems available on this screen include:

Find           Searches a column in a scrolling region (tablefield).  If
               searching a text column, Find will locate all occurrences
               wherever they are in the column.

Help           Displays this screen.

End            Returns to the Resource List Display screen.

Quit           Exits IPM.
