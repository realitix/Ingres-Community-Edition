You are viewing the Blocking Lock Display screen.  This screen helps locate
bottleneck areas in the database.  If there are tables where concurrent
access is not occurring (i.e.  much waiting is occurring because a database
session is performing table level locking or has page locks which escalate
to table level locks), "Block_Info" can find the cause (the "Block_Info"
menuitem is found on the Lock List Display screen).  It can find the lock
that is granted on a resource for which another lock is waiting.

For instance, suppose there is a lock list which is blocked (waiting
or converting), "Block_Info" finds the blocking lock.  It could either
be a granted page lock on the same page or a granted table lock on the
table which contains the page (the granted lock is known as a "blocking
lock" because it is blocking access to a resource).  All locks which are
found are displayed in the scrolling area in the bottom area of the popup.
The upper portion of the popup contains information on the selected resource.
The first lock in the scrolling area is the blocking lock.  All other
(waiting) locks are displayed below it.

One way to look for concurrency bottlenecks is to run IPM on the desired
database.  Once the Lock List Display screen is displayed, <TAB> over
to the "Status" column.  Select the "Find" menuitem.  In response to the
"String to search for" prompt, enter "WAIT".  If a waiting lock list is
found, select the "Block_Info" menuitem.  If the blocking lock is in the
Ingres locking system in the current installation on the machine where
IPM is running, "Block_Info" will find it.

Information on this screen includes:

Resource ID    The resource block identifier of the resource that the blocking
               lock is held on.

Resource Type  The type of the resource.  Valid types are:

               database     Any users connected to database will hold a
                            database lock on that database.

               table        Any user in a table will hold a table lock on
                            that table.

               page         Any user accessing a page in a table will hold a
                            page lock on that page.

               row          This lock type is held on a user table row if  
                            row level locking is enabled. It is also used    
                            for certain system catalog operations.

               createtable  Any user creating a table will hold a createtable
                            lock on that table.

               svpage       Each page touched by a server on behalf of a
                            session in that server will hold a server page
                            lock.

               extend       This lock type is used while extending (adding a
                            new page to) a file.  It prevents two processes
                            from trying to add pages to the same file at
                            the same time.

               config       This lock type is used when accessing a database
                            config file.  The config file holds database
                            configuration information.

               dbtblid      This lock type is used to manage temp-table
                            id's.  This does not actually lock anything, but
                            the lock value is used to store the next table id
                            to use for temp tables.

               svdatabase   Each database opened by a server will hold
                            a server database lock on it.

               svtable      Each table touched by a session in a server will
                            hold a server table resource lock.

               event        This lock type is used by Ingres processes that
                            use the locking system as a means to signal
                            events.  Therefore it does not actually lock
                            anything.

               control      This is a table control lock.  It is requested in
                            order to perform MODIFY, INDEX, RELOCATE,
                            DESTROY, and CREATE SQL commands.  This lock is
                            also held by sessions reading a table with
                            readlock=nolock set.

               journal      This lock type is used when accessing database
                            journal files.  It is held only by RCP (Recovery
                            process) and ACP (Archiver process).

               opendb       Each open database in a server holds an open
                            database resource lock.

               checkpoint   Each database which has online backup running
                            holds a checkpoint resource lock on it.

               ckpcluster   This lock type is the same as checkpoint but is
                            for VAXcluster installations of Ingres.

               buffermgr    Each multiserver data buffer holds a buffer
                            manager lock.

               bufmgrdb     This is a buffer manager database lock.  It is
                            used to determine the validity of cache
                            contents.  When a database is opened by a server,
                            the value in this lock is used to determine if
                            the cached information for the database is
                            valid.  Therefore it doesn't actually lock
                            anything.

               bufmgrtable  This lock type is the same as the buffer manager
                            database lock, but operates on tables rather than
                            databases.

               syscontrol   This lock type is used in conjunction with user
                            defined abstract datatypes.

               eventcontrol This lock type is used in conjunction with event
                            signaling.

               ckptxn       This lock type is used to coordinate online
                            checkpoints of a database.  All transactions which
                            have updated the database have this lock.

               audit        This lock type is used in conjunction with the
                            auditing facility.

               phpage       This lock type is used when row locking to get
                            shared/exclusive control of page.
 
               value        This lock type is used to lock a key value for 
                            duplicate checking and phantom protection.

Requested      The mode that this resource is requested in.  The possible
               modes are:

               S     Shared - used when reading.

               IS    Intended shared - for table resource types, this means
                     that there are shared page resources in this table.

               X     Exclusive - used when writing.

               IX    Intended exclusive - same as intended shared except pages
                     are exclusively locked.

               N     Null - used to keep a lock without causing locking
                     contention.  It's less expensive to convert a lock than
                     to drop and request a new lock.

               SIX   Shared with intent to update.  Used with ESQL cursors.

Convert        The mode that this resource is converting to.  See the Mode
               list above for Requested.

DB Name        The name of the database.

Table          The table name this resource belongs to.  If the resource is
               not a table or page resource type, this field will not appear.

Page           The page number of this resource.  If the resource is
               not a page resource type, this field will not appear.

The scrolling area contains the following columns:

ID             The internal lock identifier for this lock.

List ID        The internal lock list identifier that this lock belongs to.

Session        The name of the session that this lock belongs to.

RQ             The mode the lock was requested in.  The possible modes
               are listed above under "Requested".

State          Current state of lock (GR = granted, WT = waiting)

If the lock that is being searched for is on another node in the cluster
(VAXcluster only), that lock may not be visible on the current node.
Run IPM on the other nodes to find them.

The following menuitems are available:

Find           Searches a column in a scrolling region (tablefield).  If
               searching a text column, "Find" will locate all occurrences
               wherever they are in the column.

Help           Displays this screen.
