You are viewing the Log Process Display screen.  This screen displays the
current processes in the logging system.  These include DBMS servers, the
archiver and recovery processes. On VMS, the "Process_Info" menuitem will
invoke the Detailed Process Information screen.  Information available
includes number of open databases and log write requests.  By viewing
this screen, you may determine (by process) how much logging activity is
occurring for a DBMS server, for instance.

Columns of interest on the Log Process Display screen include:

    ID             The internal PID of processes in the logging
                   system.  This is not the operating system process ID.

    PID            The operating system process ID for this process.

    Type           The type of process.  The valid types include:

                   FCTDBMS      The process is a DBMS server running
                                with fast commit.

                   ARCHIV       This process is the archiver for the
                                current installation.

                   RECOVER      The recovery process.

                   DBMS         This process is a DBMS server.

                   SBM          Server is attached to a shared data buffer.

                   CKPDB        On line backup.

    OpenDB         The number of different databases currently opened.

    Write          The number of log file write I/O requests made by this
                   process.

    Force          The number of log buffer forces requested.

    Wait           The number of times the current process waited
                   to use the logging system.

    Begin          The number of transactions started by this process.

    End            The number of transactions ended.  The difference between
                   the value in this column and the value in the "Begin"
                   column is the number of current transactions for this
                   process.

Menuitems available on this screen include:

    Refresh        Queries the Ingres logging system for logging 
                   information.  Process, database and transaction information 
                   are obtained together to ensure a consistent snapshot of 
                   the logging system.

    Process_Info   Displays a screen which shows various job-process
                   information for the process on which the cursor is
                   placed.  Information includes CPU time, Direct
                   I/O, Buffered I/O, Enqueue limit, etc.  This display
                   automatically refreshes.  This menuitem is available on
                   VMS only.

    Find           Searches a column in a scrolling region (tablefield).
                   If searching a text column, Find will locate all
                   occurrences wherever they are in the column.

    Help           Displays Ingres help screens.

    End            Returns to the Log Info Menu screen.

    Quit           Exit IPM.
