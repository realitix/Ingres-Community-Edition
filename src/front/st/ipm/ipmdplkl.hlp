You are viewing the Lock List Display screen.  This screen displays an entry for
each lock list in the Ingres lock system.  System locklists (NONPROTECT)
are not displayed unless the "Display system locklists" option is set
(see help on the Option Selection screen) or the -e flag is specified on
the command line.

This screen is useful for locating transactions which can't proceed because
they are blocked from proceeding by another transaction.  Each transaction
will be represented in the Lock List Display screen by a lock list.
The session name (if any) is also displayed. To find waiting lock lists,
<TAB> to the Status column and select the "Find" menuitem.  In response
to the "Find" prompt, type "WAIT" then <CR>.  If there are any lock lists
with blocked locks, the cursor will be placed on that lock list.  See the
"Find" menuitem for more information.

If the status is ENQWAIT, the lock list in question is waiting for a
resource locked by another Ingres user on another node in the VAXcluster
(VMS only).  In this case, invoke IPM on the other nodes and search for
a lock list holding locks on the resource in contention.

To view the locks for a given lock list, select the "Examine" menuitem.
The submenu that appears allows the viewing of all locks for all lock lists
or for a particular lock list.  When examining all locks for all lock lists,
there can be a long delay before the Lock Detail Display screen appears
because every database that has a lock on it must be opened to get table
names.  Since locks from all lock lists are unsorted, each database may
be opened and closed many times. For this reason, it is wise to examine
locks for a single lock list.  Some lock lists contain locks from many
databases in unsorted order -- the warning just mentioned applies here also.

By selecting the "Options" menuitem, IPM options can be changed.  The only
option that affects this screen is the "Display empty locklists" option If
any options were changed for lock lists or resources, select the "Refresh"
menuitem. See help on the Option Selection screen.

Columns on this screen include:

ID             Internal lock list identifier.

Session        The name of the session or "<none>".  Only lock lists
               belonging to user transactions have session names.

Count          The total number of locks on the list currently.

Logical        The number of logical locks on the list currently.

MaxL           The total number of logical locks allowed to be on this
               list.  For user transactions, this is the maximum number
               of locks per lock list.  Some internal lock lists which
               contain physical locks, exceed this number.

Status         The state of the lock list when the locking information
               was obtained.  The possible values are:

               WAIT              Waiting for a lock.  This indicates
                                 a blocked lock.  Use the "Block_Info"
                                 menuitem to find the blocking lock.

               NONPROTECT        Can be released without going through
                                 recovery (system lock lists only)

               ORPHAN            Lock list remaining without transaction.

               EWAIT             Waiting on a system event.

               RECOVER           Lock list taken over by the recovery process.

               MASTER            Lock list owned by the recovery process.

               ESET              Lock list set on wait queue for event.

               EDONE             Event that the lock list is waiting on
                                 is done.

               NOINTERRUPT       Lock requests on this list are non-
                                 interruptible.

               The following statuses only apply on VAXcluster installations:

               ENQWAIT           Waiting for VMS lock request

               G_DEADLOCK_SEARCH Global deadlock search in progress.

               STALL_ENQ         Lock requests are stalled for node
                                 failure recovery.

When the "More_Info" menuitem is selected, a popup containing an additional
fields for the specified lock list is displayed.  The additional fields are:

Transaction    The transaction identifier associated with this lock list.
ID             This value corresponds to the "External TX ID" column on the
               Log Transaction Display screen.

Related lock   The related lock list identifier, if not a transaction
list ID        lock list.

Count          The number of related lock list identifiers that this lock list
               must assure are released before this lock list can be released.

Waiting        Internal resource block identifier of the lock that is
resource list  currently blocked.
ID

Menuitems available on this screen include:

Refresh        Queries the Ingres locking system for locking information.
               Lock List and Resource information are obtained together
               to ensure a consistent snapshot of the locking system.
               After setting IPM Options, select this menuitem so the
               locking information reflects the current options.  See
               help on the Option Selection screen.

More_Info      Place the cursor on the desired lock list and select this
               menuitem.  Additional information for the lock list is
               displayed on a popup screen.

Examine        Displays a submenu which allows the viewing of the individual
               locks in all displayed lock lists or a particular lock list.
               The submenu choices are:

               Current_List    Displays all the locks in the indicated lock
                               list (the one the cursor was placed on).
                               If table names need to be looked up, there may
                               be a delay because a database must be opened.

               Find            Searches any column in the scrolling area.
                               <TAB> to the desired column, then
                               select "Find".

               End             Returns to the previous menu.

Block_Info     If the lock list that the cursor is placed on contains a lock
               which can't be granted, selecting this menuitem will display
               the Blocking Lock Display screen.  The lock which is blocking
               a lock in the current lock list is displayed along with all
               other locks on that given resource.  The blocking transaction
               is always listed first.  The blocked transactions are listed
               after it.  If this menuitem is selected and the current lock
               list does not have any blocked locks (locks waiting to be
               granted), a popup message is displayed.

Options        Displays the Option Selection screen.  The current option
               settings are displayed.  Various options can be modified
               and saved.

Find           Searches a column in a scrolling region (tablefield).
               If searching a text column, "Find" will locate all
               occurrences wherever they are in the column.

Help           Displays this screen.

End            Returns to the Lock Info Menu screen.

Quit           Exits IPM.
