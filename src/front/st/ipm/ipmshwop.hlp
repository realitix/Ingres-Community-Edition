You are viewing the Option Selection screen.  This screen allows you to view
and change IPM runtime options.  Most options control what resources will
be displayed when the Resource Display screen is refreshed.

These options can also be specified on the command line when IPM is invoked.
By specifying appropriate options, you can view detailed resource locking
information down to the page level or a summary display of what databases
are currently open.

Some options are incompatible with other options.  It makes no sense, for
instance, to specify display of all resource types but limit display of
table resource locks to locks held on a specific table.  A table resource
lock type is a subset of all resource types.

When you specify options, IPM sets related options (if any) appropriately.
When you save the settings, IPM checks if any options are set incorrectly,
and displays an error message if so.

Below is a description of each option:

Display null resources    By default, IPM suppresses display of granted null
                          resources.  (Granted null relation locks show what
                          tables were referenced during the database session:
                          i.e. a granted null lock on table "x" indicates that
                          a query was run against table "x".  Granted null
                          locks don't block any access to the resource they
                          are granted on.)  If set to "Y", IPM displays any
                          resources which are granted null and which qualify 
                          based on other specified options are displayed.  "N"
                          is the default unless a resource type is specified.

Display all               By default, IPM displays database, open database,
resource types            relation and page resources.  If set to "Y", IPM
                          will display all Ingres resource types.

Display specified         By default, IPM displays database, open database,
resource type             relation and page resources.  If set to "Y", you may
                          enter the resource to display for in the "Type to
                          display" field.  Resource types of interest include:
                                database 
                                table 
                                page 
                                createtable 
                          Other resource types exist.  Enter a "?" in the
                          "Type to display" field and enter RETURN to display
                          a popup list of resource types.

Display resources         By default, IPM displays resources for all databases
for one DB                in the installation.  If set to "Y", you may enter
                          the database in the "Specify database" field.
                          Enter a "?" in the "Specify database" field and hit
                          RETURN to display a popup list of databases.

Display resources         By default, IPM displays resources for all
for one table             tables.  If set to "Y", you may enter the
                          table name in the "Specify a table name" field.
                          You must also set the "Display resources for one DB"
                          field to "Y".

Display Refresh           By default, IPM displays "snapshots" of your 
                          Ingres installation.  If set to a number 
                          greater than zero, IPM automatically refreshes the 
                          display.  Select a number between 1 and 999 to 
                          specify autorefresh (auto update) every "n" seconds 
                          on the Lock Summary, Log Summary and Log Header 
                          Display screens.

Display system            By default, IPM displays user locklists only.  A
locklists                 locklist with a status of "NONPROTECT" is usually
                          a system lock list.  If set to "Y", IPM also
                          displays system lock lists.

Display inactive          By default, IPM displays active transactions only.
transactions              A transaction with a status of "INACTIVE" is not
                          displayed by default and is usually a system
                          transaction.  User transactions which have been
                          committed but not journaled have a status of
                          INACTIVE.  If set to "Y", IPM also displays inactive
                          transactions

Once the desired options have been specified, select the "OK" menuitem.
If the Options screen is called from the Lock List Display or Resource
Display screens, select the "Refresh" menuitem to re-run the search with
the new specified search criteria.

The following menuitems are available:

OK          Saves the options which are shown and returns to the previous
            screen.  

Cancel      Ignores any changes made to the options and returns to the
            previous screen.

Defaults    Resets all options to the state when the IPM Option Selection
            screen was entered.  Does not return to the previous screen.
            At this point any changes to the options can be made.

Help        Displays this screen.

Quit        Exits IPM.
