You are viewing the DBA Operations screen.  This screen allows an Ingres 
superuser to delete the session on which the cursor is placed.  If the Delete
sub-menuitem is selected, that session will be removed from the server.
Any uncommitted transaction the session had is rolled back.

NOTE: Do NOT remove Ingres internal sessions (session names marked with
angle brackets "<>" as shown).  If you do, your entire Ingres installation
may stop and you may lose all uncommitted transactions.  For instance,
if you remove the "<Fast Commit Thread>" session, all user sessions will
stop, all uncommitted transactions will be lost, no new connections will
be accepted, and you will have to take down your installation manually.
