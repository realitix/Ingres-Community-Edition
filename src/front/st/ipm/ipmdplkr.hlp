You are viewing the Resource List Display screen.  This screen contains an
entry for each resource that has one or more locks granted/requested on it.
The information displayed is sorted by database.  Page resources are listed
under the table resource that they belong to (all pages for table "x" in
database "test" are listed under the entry for table "x").  The Database
name is left justified in the "DB-Table-Page" column.  The database name
is only printed when it changes.  The same applies for table names (table
names are indented 5 spaces).

This screen allows high traffic areas to be found.  If there is much
page locking in a given table, there will be many page type entries
under the table entry of interest.  Of course, it is easier to select the
"Examine" menuitem by placing the cursor on the table entry of interest.
For example, to see what and how many locks are on table "test", place the
cursor on that table resource entry then select the "Examine" menuitem.
When the Lock Detail Display screen appears, there will be one lock for
each session touching the "test" table.  If many locks are displayed, it
is an indication that this table is a potential contention source (should
any session attempt to lock the table shared or exclusive, for example).

If a database can't be opened to display table names, IPM will displays
"<can't find [x,y]>" instead.  X is the reltid of the table and y is the
reltidx of that table (reltid and reltidx are columns in the iirelation
database catalog).  When a database can't be opened it may be because the
database is locked exclusively by another session.  It can also be caused
by another user accessing that database using a server started up with the
-sole or /sole option (see the Ingres Installation Guide).  If IPM 
is in standalone mode (-s option), database names will usually be 
unavailable as well.

By selecting the "Options" menuitem, various IPM options which affect what
resources are displayed can be viewed or modified.  Please refer to the
help information describing the Option Selection screen.  After changing
any of the options that affect the Resource List Display screen, it is
a good idea to select the "Refresh" menuitem so the resource information
displayed reflects the changed options.

The only time you do not need to select the "Refresh" menuitem is when the
options just changed would result in a subset of the resource information
currently displayed.  For example, all resources for database "test" may
have been selected based on the previous options.  If the new option
settings would only select a specific resource type for that database, it is
only necessary to return to the Lock Info Menu then select the "Resources"
menuitem.  In any event, selecting the "Refresh" menuitem after changing the
options will collect resource information based on the new option settings.

Columns on this screen include:

Id             The internal resource block identifier.

GR             This indicates the mode that this resource is granted in.
               The possible modes are:

               S     Shared - used when reading.

               IS    Intended shared - for table resource types, this means
                     that there are shared page resources in this table.

               X     Exclusive - used when writing.

               IX    Intended exclusive - same as intended shared except
                     pages are exclusively locked.

               N     Null - used to keep a lock without causing locking
                     contention.  It's less expensive to convert a lock
                     than to drop and request a new lock.

               SIX   Shared with intent to update.  Used with ESQL cursors.

CV             This indicates the mode that this resource is converting to. 
               (See the list above)

Lock Type      The type of the resource.  Valid types are:

               database     Any users connected to database will hold a
                            database lock on that database.

               table        Any user in a table will hold a table lock on
                            that table.

               page         Any user accessing a page in a table will hold a
                            page lock on that page.

               row          This lock type is held on a user table row if
                            row level locking is enabled. It is also used 
                            for certain system catalog operations. 

               createtable  Any user creating a table will hold a createtable
                            lock on that table.

               svpage       Each page touched by a server on behalf of a
                            session in that server will hold a server page
                            lock.

               extend       This lock type is used while extending (adding a
                            new page to) a file.  It prevents two processes
                            from trying to add pages to the same file at

               config       This lock type is used when accessing a database
                            config file.  The config file holds database
                            configuration information.

               dbtblid      This lock type is used to manage temp-table
                            id's.  This does not actually lock anything, but
                            the lock value is used to store the next table id
                            to use for temp tables.

               svdatabase   Each database opened by a server will hold a
                            server database lock on it.

               svtable      Each table touched by a session in a server will
                            hold a server table resource lock.

               event        This lock type is used by Ingres processes that
                            use the locking system as a means to signal
                            events.  Therefore it does not actually lock
                            anything.

               control      This is a table control lock.  It is requested in
                            order to perform MODIFY, INDEX, RELOCATE,
                            DESTROY, and CREATE SQL commands.  This lock is
                            also held by sessions reading a table with
                            readlock=nolock set.

               journal      This lock type is used when accessing database
                            journal files.  It is held only by RCP (Recovery
                            process) and ACP (Archiver process).

               opendb       Each open database in a server holds an open
                            database resource lock.

               checkpoint   Each database which has online backup running
                            holds a checkpoint resource lock on it.

               ckpcluster   This lock type is the same as checkpoint but is
                            for VAXcluster installations of Ingres.

               buffermgr    Each multiserver data buffer holds a buffer
                            manager lock.

               bufmgrdb     This is a buffer manager database lock.  It is
                            used to determine the validity of cache
                            contents.  When a database is opened by a server,
                            the value in this lock is used to determine if
                            the cached information for the database is
                            valid.  Therefore it doesn't actually lock
                            anything.

               bufmgrtable  This lock type is the same as the buffer manager
                            database lock, but operates on tables rather than
                            databases.

               syscontrol   This lock type is used in conjunction with user
                            defined abstract datatypes.

               eventcontrol This lock type is used in conjunction with event
                            signaling.

               ckptxn       This lock type is used to coordinate online
                            checkpoints of a database.  All transactions which
                            have updated the database have this lock.

               audit        This lock type is used in conjunction with the
                            auditing facility.

               phpage       This lock type is used when row locking to get
                            shared/exclusive control of page.

               value        This lock type is used to lock a key value for 
                            duplicate checking and phantom protection.             
                            
DB-Table-Pg    The database name, table name and/or page that this lock is
               held on is displayed.  The values are justified and formatted.

When the "More_Info" menuitem is selected, a popup containing additional
fields for the specified resource is displayed.  The additional fields are:

Value          Lock value associated with this resource

Invalid        Indicates if the value is valid or not.

Number of      This indicates the number of physical locks held on this
locks          resource.

The menuitems available on this screen include:

Refresh        Queries the Ingres locking system for locking information.
               Lock List and Resource information are obtained together
               to ensure a consistent snapshot of the locking system.
               After setting IPM Options, you should select this menuitem
               so the locking information reflects the options you set.

More_Info      Place the cursor on the desired resource and select this
               menuitem.  The number of physical locks on the indicated
               resource are shown, as well as some additional information.

Examine        Place the cursor on the desired resource and select this
               menuitem.  The Lock Detail Display screen is displayed.
               It shows information for all locks on the indicated resource.
               Other information such as the session name is also displayed.

Find           Searches a column in a scrolling region (tablefield).
               If searching a text column, Find will locate all
               occurrences wherever they are in the column.

Help           Displays this screen.

End            Returns to the Lock Info Menu screen.

Quit           Exits IPM.
