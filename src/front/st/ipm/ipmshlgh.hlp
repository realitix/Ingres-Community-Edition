You are viewing the Logging System Header screen.  This screen displays
information about the transaction log file and the Ingres logging system.
The current state of the logging system as well as critical points in
the log file are displayed.  The Log file Diagram displays a logical
view of the log file in use.  The Log file Diagram starts at page 1
of the log file through the page specified by the "Block count" field.
The area of the diagram field covered by the arrow (">----->") is the
area of the log file in use.  As the BOF and EOF (begin and end of file)
move, so does the arrow.  The diagram uses plus signs ("+++>----->")
to display logfile space reserved for use by the recovery system.

This screen can be displayed during benchmarks, tests or during the day to
help the Ingres system administrator determine how close to FORCE_ABORT the
log file gets.  The "Blocks in use" field shows the actual number of blocks
in use. If it is greater than the value in the "Abort interval" field, IPM
will display a warning indicator.  The same occurs when the blocks in use
exceeds the value in the "Logfull interval" field.  Based on how close and
often the percentage of log file in use approaches the Abort interval, the
Ingres system administrator may decide to increase the size of the log file.

This screen will autorefresh the information if the -r flag was specified at
startup or the "Display Refresh" field on the Option Selection screen was
changed to a number between 1 and 999 seconds.  Autorefresh is desirable
when monitoring this information.

When the "Examine" menuitem is selected, the Log file Diagram field is
highlighted and a caret symbol "^" is displayed marking the position of
the log file currently being examined.  The other fields which appear
indicate the range of log file pages currently being examined as well as
what transactions occur in that range.  By using the "Next" and "Previous"
menuitems, the caret symbol can be moved to any area of the Log file
diagram covered by the arrow (">----->").  By default, when the "Examine"
menuitem is selected, the caret symbol appears at the BOF.  From there,
the "Next" menuitem can be selected until a user transaction appears in
the scrolling area.  This transaction is the oldest transaction in the
log file and could/will prevent log file space from being reclaimed.

You can also examine a particular position in the Log file by moving the
cursor to the Log file Diagram, using the arrow keys to place the cursor
anywhere on the arrow, and selecting the "Examine" menuitem.  This will
also pop up the range of log file pages with transactions.

When you select the "Examine" menuitem, a snapshot of the transactions
as well as the BOF and EOF is taken and used until the "Examine" submenu
is exited.  You can obtain the latest state of the logging system by
exiting the "Examine" submenu and select "Examine" again.  If autorefresh
is enabled, it is suspended while using the "Examine" option.  When the
submenu is exited from, autorefresh is re-enabled.

Fields on the this screen include:

Block size     The log file block size in bytes.  This value is specified when
               running IIBUILD or rcpconfig.  See the Ingres
               Installation Guide.

Block count    The number of blocks in the log file.  This value is also
               specified when running IIBUILD or rcpconfig.  Multiply by the
               block size to get the log file size in bytes.

Buffer count   The number of log buffers.  These are the same size as the log
               file block size.

CP interval    A consistency point occurs when the log file size ("Blocks in
               use" field) reaches a multiple of this number.

Logfull        The logging system parameter LOG_FULL_LIMIT.  When the "Blocks
interval       in use" field is equal to this value, all transaction activity
               is halted.  A warning field is displayed in the lower right
               corner.  This value is also determined when running IIBUILD or 
               rcpconfig.  Please see the Ingres Installation Guide.

Abort          The logging system parameter FORCE_ABORT.  When the "Blocks in
interval       use" field exceeds this value, the oldest transaction is
               aborted.  To find out which transaction is being aborted, use
               the "Log Transaction Display" screen.  Tab to the "Status"
               column, select the "Find" menuitem to look for the word
               "FORCE".  A warning indicator is also displayed.  Please refer
               to the Ingres Installation Guide.

Last           The last transaction ID used.  This number corresponds to the
transaction    "External TX ID" column on the Log Transaction Display screen
ID             and the "Transaction ID" column on the Lock List Display.

Blocks in      The number of blocks in use in the log file.  This value is
use            used for the "Log file in use" bargraph.
                   
Blocks         The number of remaining blocks in the log file.
available

Begin (BOF)    The logical beginning of file.  The position in the logfile
               that holds the newest transaction.

CP             The log file address of the last consistency point.  The
               position in the logfile where the last CP was taken.

End (EOF)      The logical end of file.  The position in the logfile that
               holds the oldest uncommitted transaction.  The difference
               between the BOF and EOF is the % in use, also displayed in the
               "Blocks in use" field.

Journal        The log file address range where the archiver will look for
window         records to journal.

Status         Indicates the status of the logging and recovery systems.
               Valid status values include:

               ONLINE           The logging and recovery systems are OK.

               ECPDONE          A consistency point was taken.

               CPNEEDED         The logging system is about to take a
                                consistency point.

               LOGFULL          The log file is full.  The Ingres system
                                manager should determine the cause of this
                                and increase the log file size.  A warning
                                indicator is also displayed.

               FORCE_ABORT      The logging system is aborting the oldest
                                transaction.  The Log Transaction Display
                                screen can be used to find out which
                                transaction is being aborted.

               RECOVER          The recovery process is performing recovery.

               ARCHIVE          The archiver process is archiving journaled
                                transactions to the journal files.

               ACP_SHUTDOWN     The archiver is preparing to shutdown.  (This
                                indicates that an "rcpconfig/shutdown" (VMS)
                                or "rcpconfig -shutdown" (UNIX) has been
                                performed).

               IMM_SHUTDOWN     An immediate shutdown is occurring.  This
                                indicates that an "rcpconfig/imm_shutdown"
                                (VMS) or "rcpconfig -imm_shutdown" (UNIX)
                                has been issued).

               START_ARCHIVER   The archiver has died and must be restarted
                                by the Ingres system administrator.  The
                                archiver will not restart automatically.  If
                                it is not restarted, the log file will reach
                                the LOG_FILE_FULL limit.

               PURGEDB          This status appears when a database has been
                                closed by the last user who had it open; the
                                archiver is archiving transactions that belong
                                to this database.

% in use       The percentage of the log file in use is displayed.

Log file       This depicts a logical view of the log file with the left side
Diagram        representing page 1 and the right side representing "Block
               count" pages.  An arrow diagram (">------>") represents the
               portion of the log file in use.  If the portion of the log file
               in use only spans one position an "*" is displayed.  As the EOF
               and BOF change, the arrow will move from left to right and wrap
               around the diagram.

Menuitems available on this screen include:

Refresh        Queries the Ingres logging system for logging system
               header information.  Even if the autorefresh option is set,
               this menuitem can still be selected at any time.

Examine        Allows examination of the transactions in the log file.  The
               Log File Diagram is highlighted and a "^" (caret) symbol
               appears in that field.  Any transactions occurring in the range
               of pages covered by the caret symbol are displayed in the
               scrolling area.  The range of log file pages being examined is
               also displayed.  A submenu appears containing the following
               menuitems which allow you to move the caret symbol around on
               the diagram.  Until you exit this submenu, the information
               displayed is a snapshot.

               Next           Moves the caret symbol to the right by one
                              position.  Moving beyond EOF will wrap around
                              to BOF.  Any transactions occurring in the range
                              covered by the next position will be displayed
                              in the scrolling area.

               Previous       Moves the caret symbol to the left.  Moving
                              beyond BOF will wrap around to EOF.  Any
                              transactions occurring in the range covered by
                              the previous position will be displayed in the
                              scrolling area.

               More_Info      Displays a popup which shows additional
                              information for the transactions in the
                              Transaction scrolling area.  The cursor should
                              be placed on a transaction of interest
                              before this menuitem is selected.

               End            Returns to the Logging System Header screen.

Help           Displays this screen.

End            Returns to the Log Info Menu screen.

Quit           Exit IPM.
