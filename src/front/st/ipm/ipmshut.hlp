You are viewing the Shutdown screen.  This screen allows you to shut down
the indicated server (the one the cursor was resting on).  There are two
different ways to shut down the indicated server:

Soft_Shutdown  Same as "set server shut" in IIMONITOR.  Soft_Shutdown is
               preferred providing it is OK to wait until the current
               sessions end before the server stops.  After this menuitem
               is executed, the connection to the server is maintained and
               the submenu reappears.  This allows the "Hard_Shutdown"
               menuitem to be selected, if desired.  When the "End"
               menuitem is selected, the connection is dropped and it is
               not possible to reconnect to the server at all.

Hard_Shutdown  Same as "stop server" in IIMONITOR.  When in a hurry to
               stop a server, use this instead of operating system commands
               like VMS stop or UNIX kill -9.  Executing this menuitem will
               immediately stop the server and break out of the submenu.
