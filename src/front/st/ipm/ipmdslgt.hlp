You are viewing the Log Transaction Display screen.  This screen contains an
entry for each transaction in the logging system.  By monitoring this
screen, you may observe the activity of each transaction and pinpoint
those which are generating much logging system activity.  The status of
each transaction is also displayed.  By using the "Find" menuitem, you may
search for FORCE_ABORT transactions by tabbing to the "Status" column and
selecting the "Find" menuitem.  The different status values are listed below.

On VMS, the Process_Info menuitem allows monitoring of the process that the
selected transaction belongs to.  For instance, in multiserver installations,
it is not necessary to determine what server a transaction belongs to.  Just
place the cursor on the desired transaction and select the "Process_Info"
menuitem.  The Detailed Process Information screen is displayed.

Note that once a transaction is committed, it no longer is in the logging
system and when this screen is refreshed, will disappear from the display
if it has committed between the last screen refresh and the current time.
Transactions which have been committed and not yet journaled (and when
fast commit is on) may still appear with a status of INACTIVE.  By default,
INACTIVE transactions are not displayed.  The "-i" option or the "Display
inactive transactions" field on the Options Display screen can be set to
"y" to force display of inactive transactions.

Columns of interest on the Log Transaction Display screen include:

    External TX    The Transaction ID.  This column corresponds to the
    ID             "Transaction ID" field on the More Info popup screen for
                   the Lock List display.

    Database       The name of the database that this transaction is running
                   in.

    Session        The session name running this transaction.  Session
                   names beginning with "$" are internal transactions.

    Status         The status of the transaction.  Valid statuses include:

                   INACTIVE       Not Active.  Ingres internal transactions
                                  are usually in this state.

                   ACTIVE         Active - user transactions are usually in
                                  this state.  No COMMIT has been issued.

                   PROTECT        Indicates that this transaction must be
                                  recoverable.  User transactions always have
                                  this status.

                   NOABORT        Indicates that this transaction can't be
                                  aborted due to FORCE_ABORT or LOG_FILE_FULL.
                                  Distributed transactions have this status.

                   RECOVER        This transaction has been taken over by the
                                  recovery process.

                   FORCE_ABORT    This transaction is being rolled out because
                                  the log file reached the FORCE_ABORT limit.

                   SESSION_ABORT  This transaction is being rolled out because
                                  the session owning this transaction has
                                  requested the abort.

                   SERVER_ABORT   The server that this transaction belongs to
                                  is aborting that transaction.

                   DISTRIBUTED    Indicates that this transaction is a slave
                                  transaction of a larger distributed
                                  transaction.

                   WILLING_COMMIT Indicates that this transaction is ready
                                  to commit.  This applies to distributed
                                  transactions only.

                   RE-ASSOC       Indicates that this transaction's connection
                                  to the master coordinating application has
                                  been lost and the transaction is awaiting
                                  reconnection in order to close the
                                  transaction.

                   MAN_ABORT      Indicates that this distributed transaction
                                  was manually rolled out.

                   MAN_COMMIT     Indicates that this distributed transaction
                                  was manually committed.

    Write          The number of log file write I/O requests made by this
                   transaction.

    Split          The number of times a write to the log file needed to be
                   split across more than one log file page and there was not
                   a free buffer.  If this occurs frequently, the number or
                   size of the log buffers should be increased to prevent
                   throughput problems to the log file.

When the "More_Info" menuitem is selected, a popup containing additional
fields for the specified transaction is displayed.  The additional
fields are:

    Internal TX    The internal transaction ID used by the logging
    ID             system.

    Dis TX ID      The distributed transaction ID that this transaction
                   belongs to.

    Session ID     The session ID of the session that owns this transaction.
                   This ID corresponds to the "ID" column on the Session List
                   screen.

    DB ID          The internal database ID used by the logging system.  This
                   field corresponds to the "ID" field on the More Info popup
                   screen for the Log Database display.

    Force          The number of times this transaction has caused a log

                   to use the logging system.

    Internal PID   The internal PID used by the logging system for the process
                   that this transaction belongs to.  This field corresponds
                   to the "ID" column on the Log Process Display screen.

    PID            The operating system process ID for the process that this
                   transaction belongs to.  This field corresponds to the
                   "PID" column on the Log Process Display screen.

    First          The log file address for the begin transaction marker
