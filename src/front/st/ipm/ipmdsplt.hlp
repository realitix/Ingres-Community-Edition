You are viewing the Display Lock Type screen.  This popup screen contains the
following list of lock/resource types.  Below is an explanation of what
each lock type is used for:

database         Any users in a database will hold a database lock
                 on that database.

table            Any user in a table will hold a table lock on that table.

page             Any user accessing a page in a table will hold a page 
                 lock on that page..

row              This lock type is held on a user table row if row level  
                 locking is enabled. It is also used for certain system 
                 catalog operations.

createtable      Any user creating a table will hold a createtable
                 lock on that table

svpage           Each page touched by a server on behalf of a session in
                 that server will have a server page lock.

extend           This lock type is used while extending (adding a new
                 page to) a file.  It prevents two processes from
                 trying to add pages to the same file at the same time.

config           Used when accessing a database config file.  The
                 config file holds database configuration information.

dbtblid          Used to manage temp-table id's.  This does not
                 actually lock anything, but the lock value is used to
                 store the next table id to use for temp tables.

svdatabase       Each database opened by a server will have a server
                 database lock on it.

svtable          Each table touched by a session in a server will have a
                 server table resource lock.

event            Used by Ingres processes that want to use the locking
                 system as a means to signal events.  This does not
                 actually lock anything.

control          This is a table control lock.  It is requested in
                 order to perform MODIFY, INDEX, RELOCATE, DESTROY,
                 and CREATE SQL commands.  This lock is also held by
                 sessions reading a table with readlock=nolock set.

journal          This lock is used when accessing database journal
                 files.  Held only by RCP (Recovery process) and ACP
                 (Archiver process).

opendb           There is an open database resource lock for each open
                 database in a server

checkpoint       Each database which has online backup running will have
                 have a checkpoint resource lock on it.

ckpcluster       Same as checkpoint but for VAXcluster installations
                 of Ingres.

buffermgr        Each multiserver data buffer holds a buffer manager
                 lock.

bufmgrdb         Buffer manager database lock.  Used to determine
                 the validity of cache contents.  When a database
                 is opened by a server, the value in this lock is
                 used to determine if the cached information for the
                 database is valid.  Doesn't actually lock anything.

bufmgrtable      Used the same as the buffer manager database lock,
                 but operates on tables rather than databases.

syscontrol       This type is used in conjunction with user defined
                 abstract datatypes.

eventcontrol     This lock type is used in conjunction with event
                 signaling.

ckptxn           This lock type is used to coordinate online
                 checkpoints of a database.  All transactions which
                 have updated the database have this lock.

audit            This lock type is used in conjunction with the
                 auditing facility.

phpage           This lock type is used when row locking to get
                 shared/exclusive control of page.
 
value            This lock type is used to lock a key value for duplicate 
                 checking and phantom protection.
