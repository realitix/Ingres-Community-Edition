You are viewing the Lock Detail Display.  This screen contains the individual
locks for the selected lock list or all locks for all lock lists.
Database and table names are shown for table and page type locks.  If a
database can't be opened, or if IPM is running in standalone mode (-s flag),
the table ID is displayed instead of the table name.  The table is
identified by the reltid and reltidx values in the iirelation catalog.

If this screen is displaying the locks for a particular lock list, IPM
displays locks in the order in which they were acquired by the session
that the lock list belongs to.

Columns on this screen include:

ID             The internal Lock ID.

RQ             The mode the lock was requested in.  Possible values are:

               S     Shared - used when reading.

               IS    Intended shared - for table resource types, this means
                     that there are shared page resources in this table.

               X     Exclusive - used when writing.

               IX    Intended exclusive - same as intended shared except pages
                     are exclusively locked.

               N     Null - used to keep a lock without causing locking
                     contention.  It's less expensive to convert a lock than
                     to drop and request a new lock.

               SIX   Shared with intent to update.  Used with ESQL cursors.

State          Current state of the lock (GR = granted, WT = waiting,
               PHYS() = this lock is a physical lock).  This column scrolls,
               so additional information may be to the right of the visible
               part.  Use the arrow keys to scroll the column.

Lock Type      The type of the resource.  Valid types are:

               database     Any users connected to database will hold a
                            database lock on that database.

               table        Any user in a table will hold a table lock on
                            that table.

               page         Any user accessing a page in a table will hold a
                            page lock on that page.

               row          This lock type is held on a user table row if  
                            row level locking is enabled. It is also used    
                            for certain system catalog operations.

               createtable  Any user creating a table will hold a createtable
                            lock on that table.

               svpage       Each page touched by a server on behalf of a
                            session in that server will hold a server page
                            lock.

               extend       This lock type is used while extending (adding a
                            new page to) a file.  It prevents two processes
                            from trying to add pages to the same file at

               config       This lock type is used when accessing a database
                            config file.  The config file holds database
                            configuration information.

               dbtblid      This lock type is used to manage temp-table
                            id's.  This does not actually lock anything, but
                            the lock value is used to store the next table id
                            to use for temp tables.

               svdatabase   Each database opened by a server will hold
                            a server database lock on it.

               svtable      Each table touched by a session in a server will
                            hold a server table resource lock.

               event        This lock type is used by Ingres processes that
                            use the locking system as a means to signal
                            events.  Therefore it does not actually lock
                            anything.

               control      This is a table control lock.  It is requested in
                            order to perform MODIFY, INDEX, RELOCATE,
                            DESTROY, and CREATE SQL commands.  This lock is
                            also held by sessions reading a table with
                            readlock=nolock set.

               journal      This lock type is used when accessing database
                            journal files.  It is held only by RCP (Recovery
                            process) and ACP (Archiver process).

               opendb       Each open database in a server holds an open
                            database resource lock.

               checkpoint   Each database which has online backup running
                            holds a checkpoint resource lock on it.

               ckpcluster   This lock type is the same as checkpoint but is
                            for VAXcluster installations of Ingres.

               buffermgr    Each multiserver data buffer holds a buffer
                            manager lock.

               bufmgrdb     This is a buffer manager database lock.  It is
                            used to determine the validity of cache
                            contents.  When a database is opened by a server,
                            the value in this lock is used to determine if
                            the cached information for the database is
                            valid.  Therefore it doesn't actually lock
                            anything.

               bufmgrtable  This lock type is the same as the buffer manager
                            database lock, but operates on tables rather than
                            databases.

               syscontrol   This lock type is used in conjunction with user
                            defined abstract datatypes.
                            
               eventcontrol This lock type is used in conjunction with event
                            signaling.

               ckptxn       This lock type is used to coordinate online
                            checkpoints of a database.  All transactions which
                            have updated the database have this lock.

               audit        This lock type is used in conjunction with the
                            auditing facility.

               phpage       This lock type is used when row locking to get
                            shared/exclusive control of page.
 
               value        This lock type is used to lock a key value for 
                            duplicate checking and phantom protection.

DB-Table-Pg    The database name, table name and/or page that this lock is
               held on is displayed.  The values are justified and formatted.

When the "More_Info" menuitem is selected, a popup containing additional
fields for the specified lock is displayed.  The additional fields are:

Resource List  Internal Resource block identifier that this lock belongs to.
ID

VMS Lock ID    The VMS lock ID assigned to this Ingres lock (applies to
               VAXcluster installations only).

VMS Lock ID    The value contained in the VMS lock assigned to this Ingres
value          lock (applies to VAXcluster installations only).

Menuitems available on this screen include:

More_Info      Place the cursor on the desired lock and select this menuitem.
               Additional information for the indicated lock are displayed
               on a popup screen.

Resource_Info  All locks for the indicated resource are displayed on the
               Resource Lock Display screen. This is useful to see how many
               other sessions have a lock on that resource.  For example, you
               may see what other locks are held for page 0 in table "foo".
               Other information displayed includes the session name (if any).

Find           Searches a column in a scrolling region (tablefield).  If
               searching a text column, Find will locate all occurrences
               wherever they are in the column.

Help           Displays this screen.

End            Returns to the Lock List Display screen.

Quit           Exits IPM.
