You are viewing the Server List screen.  This screen displays the servers
running in your installation that are registered with the Ingres name
server.  The Name field displays the name of the server.  The Type field
displays the type of server: INGRES (DBMS server), STAR, NET (communications
server), BRIDGE (Protocol Bridge) or NAME (name server).  The Sessions field
displays the number of sessions connected to that server (applies to INGRES
and STAR servers only). The Active field displays how many of the connected
sessions are currently active.

If the server was started with a list of databases, the Database field
will list them.  Otherwise it will display ALL to indicate this server will
connect to any database in the current Ingres installation.  If there are
many databases or long database names, they can be displayed using the
More_info menuitem.

Menuitems available on this screen include:

More_Info      Displays more information about the indicated server (the one
               that the cursor was placed on).  This applies to INGRES
               and STAR servers only.

Sessions       Displays user sessions for the indicated server.  Only INGRES
               and STAR servers have sessions.

Process_Info   Displays job and process information for the indicated server.
               Parameters include CPU time, Direct I/O, Buffered I/O,
               Enqueue limit, etc.  This menuitem is available on VMS only.

Shutdown       Shuts down the indicated server.  This is limited to use by the
               Ingres superuser and applies to INGRES and STAR servers only.
               You may shut down a server in an orderly "nice" way or minimal
               "hard" way.

               re-entering the screen.
