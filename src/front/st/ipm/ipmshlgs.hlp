You are viewing the Logging Summary screen.  This screen displays various pieces
of information from the Ingres logging system.  By viewing the data on this
screen, you can determine which logging parameters need to be adjusted.
Currently, there is no way to view the logging parameters used to configure
the Ingres logging system from IPM.  Those parameters should be kept in
a handy place when viewing this screen.

This screen will autorefresh the information if the -r flag was specified at
startup or the "Display Refresh" field on the Option Selection screen was
changed to a number between 1 and 999 seconds.  Autorefresh is desirable
when monitoring this information.

When tests or benchmarks are being run it may be desirable to determine
the logging system activity during the test.  By selecting the "Interval"
menuitem then selecting the "Start_Now" menuitem, the statistics displayed
will be those accumulated since the start time.  In addition, if the Interval
option was not previously enabled, the start time and current time fields
appear in the upper right hand corner of the Logging System Summary screen.
To reset the start time (which is the time when the "Start_Now" menuitem
is selected), select the "Interval" menuitem followed by the "Start_Now"
menuitem.

The start time and statistics obtained at the start time will remain
unchanged until the "Begin_Now" or "Since_Startup" menuitems are selected
or you exit IPM.  This allows other IPM functions (e.g. locking, other
logging or server information) to be used while accumulating statistics.
When the Logging System Summary screen is displayed at a later time,
the running totals since the start time are not lost.

When displaying statistics over an interval, the "autorefresh" option
should be set.  This causes the display to be automatically updated.

Some of the fields of interest on the Logging System Summary screen are:

Database add   The number of databases added to the logging system.

Database       The number of databases removed from the logging system.  This
removes        means the last user of a database has disconnected from Ingres.
               The number of databases currently open is the difference
               between "Database add" and "Database removes".

Transaction    The number of transactions started.
begins

Transaction    The number of COMMITS or transactions ended.  This value does
ends           not include FORCE-ABORT, LOG-FULL or any other Recovery
               initiated transaction ends, such as a failover from the DBMS to
               the RCP on behalf of a transaction. The difference between
               "Transaction begins" and "Transaction ends" is the number of
               current transactions.

Log read       The number of read I/O's actually done to the log file.
I/O's          This is a physical read.

Log write      The number of write I/O's actually done to the log file.
I/O's          This is a physical write.

Log writes     The number of log write into non-paged pool on VMS and shared
               memory on UNIX.  This is a memory to memory write.

Log forces     The number of log force requests.  These occur under the
               following circumstances:

                   The buffer manager forces a specific log page to disk.
                   This occurs during the consistency point (for fast commit)
                   or before a transaction commit.

                   The buffer manager forces the last log buffer in the
                   logging system to disk.  This occurs normally during the
                   close of a table.

                   The RCP or DBMS server forces the last log record of a
                   transaction to disk before recovering the transaction.

Log waits      The number of times any event wait condition requires a 
               log buffer write to stall.  These events include LOG-FULL,
               CP writing, RECOVERY, archiving required,   FREE WAIT for log
               buffer, OPENDB wait, log buffer SPLIT WAIT, wait for log I/O to
               complete (the log buffer being written to the log file).

Log split      The number of times a log split operation is delayed due to
waits          no free log buffers.  This should be watched because the
               logging system cannot proceed with the log record split until
               a free buffer is available.  You may reduce this by increasing
               the number of log buffers or increasing their size.

Log free       The number of times all the log buffers are either in force
waits          mode or unavailable for writing.  Only one log buffer is
               written to at a time currently.  If this state is frequent
               (more than 5 per minute during busy times), then increasing
               the number of log buffers may be the solution.  Remember that
               an increase in the number of buffers requires more memory
                       (number_of_buffers * buffer_size)
               This condition will affect throughput to the log file.  Please
               consult the Ingres Installation Guide for more 
               information.

Log stall      The number of times stalled while making requests to the
waits          logging system.  This can occur while consistency points
               are being taken or during LOG-FULL conditions.  This is
               acceptable (not in the LOG-FULL case) and these types of
               stalls only last for a fraction of a second.  If 100 sessions
               are stalled for one event this count is incremented by 100.
               The following statuses will be shown in the Logging System
               Header screen depending on the causes of a Log stall wait:

                   LOGFULL, FORCE_ABORT -- log file is full

                   LOGFULL, CPFLUSH -- log file is overly full while executing
                   a consistency point (CP).  The CP may have to completed
                   before log file space can be released.  The status LOGFULL,
                   ARCHIVE may also be displayed as mentioned above.

                   LOGFULL, ARCHIVE -- the log file is full and journaled
                   transactions must be archived to free up log file space.
                   When the archiver is done, log file space is released.

Log group      The number of times that multiple transactions are
commit         participating in a log buffer flush to the log file.
               The value is incremented every time a write to disk
               completes a group commit (piggyback write).

Log group      The number of transactions that are participating in the flush
count          to the log file.  If one group commit event writes on behalf of
               10 sessions (threads), this number is incremented by 10.  The
               ratio between this number and the Log group commit indicates
               how effective group commit is (e.g. group count/group commit
               indicates the number of threads' log write requests satisfied
               per group commit write)

Check commit   The number of times that the timer associated with the group
timer          commit completes.  This does not necessarily mean that a write
               to the log file has to occur because the log buffer that
               initiated the timer may have already been written due to being
               full.  This timer is only activated when there are multiple
               transactions active in the logging system so that group commit
               does not delay a single user for no gain.

               The timer wakes up every 10 milliseconds and checks if there is
               a buffer waiting to be forced to the log file.  If a buffer is
               found, the timer will wait for 20 additional milliseconds
               before calling the routine to write out the buffer.

Timer write    The number of times a group commit timer check resulted in a
               group commit.

Inconsistent   The number of inconsistent DB occurrences.  This number should
DB             be zero.  If it is not, check the error log:

                   II_SYSTEM:[INGRES.FILES]ERRLOG.LOG (VMS)
		  $II_SYSTEM/ingres/files/errlog.log (UNIX)

               Inconsistent databases can be caused by running IISTARTUPINIT
               after a system crash (this wipes out the log file necessary for
               recovery).  Please consult the Ingres System Administrator Guide
               for more information.

Menuitems available on this screen include:

Refresh        Queries the Ingres logging system for logging summary
               information.  Even if the autorefresh option is set, this
               menuitem can still be selected at any time.

Interval       Displays a submenu which allows a start time to be set to begin
               set to begin measuring logging summary information.  This
               allows display of summary information that occurred since the
               selected start time.  Otherwise, the information displayed is
               activity since the Ingres logging system was started.  
               Choices available from the submenu are:

               Since_Startup  Selecting this menuitem will display summary
                              information since system startup.  This is the
                              default.  If the Interval option was enabled,
                              the start and current time fields disappear.

               Begin_Now      Selecting this menuitem will enable the Interval
                              option, clear all values from the screen and
                              display the start time and current time fields.
                              The next refresh of the summary information will
                              cause IPM to display the activity since the
                              start time.  The start time and summary
                              information at the start time are maintained
                              until the "Since_Startup" menuitem is selected
                              or "Begin_Now" is selected again.

               End            Returns to the previous menu.

Help           Displays this screen.

End            Returns to the Log Info Menu screen.

Quit           Exits IPM.
