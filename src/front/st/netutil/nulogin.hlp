The Login/password data tablefield contains exactly two rows, because only 
two authorizations may be defined for the current user on a vnode: one global
entry, applicable to any user on the system, and one private entry for the
current user.  (The password associated with each login is part of the
authorization entry, but for security reasons passwords are not displayed on
this tablefield, or anywhere else.)  A field in each row of the authorization
table, headed Scope, contains a short explanation of the usage of the login
displayed in that row.
