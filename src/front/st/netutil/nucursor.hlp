You may move among tablefields with the FRS tab key.  The menu items Create, 
Destroy, and Edit apply to whichever table field the cursor is in when the 
menu item is selected.  When a new entry is created in the vnode table, 
NETUTIL will automatically prompt for information to fill in both of the 
detail tablefields.  Detail records may be destroyed, edited, or new ones 
created, with the appropriate menu choice.
 
You may move within tablefields with standard FRS cursor commands, and move
between the three tablefields with the FRS tab key.  When the cursor resides
in a detail tablefield, the current vnode continues to be the same; when you 
tab back to the vnode tablefield, the cursor repositions on the entry for the 
current vnode.
