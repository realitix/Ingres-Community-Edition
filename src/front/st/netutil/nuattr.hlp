You are looking at the Attributes screen for NETUTIL.  

This NETUTIL form consists of a single form with three tablefields: 
a Virtual Node Name field which displays a list of vnode names, a detail 
table displaying the connection entries for the currently selected 
vnode (i.e. the one under the cursor), and another detail table displaying
the attribute information. As you move the cursor through the vnode tablefield,
the two detail tablefields are updated automatically with the information 
that corresponds to the newly selected vnode.

Menu Operations

All menu items apply to whichever tablefield contains the cursor when the 
item is activated.  The menu operations are:

        MENU COMMAND    SYNOPSIS
        ------------    --------

        Create          A new entry is created for whichever tablefield 
                        contains the cursor.  Whenever a new vnode entry is 
                        created, NETUTIL automatically brings up the popups 
                        for creating authorization, connection and attribute
			entries for the same vnode name. You are not required 
			to create detail records at the time the vnode entry is
                        created; the detail records will be left blank if 
                        you select the Ok menu item of the popups without 
                        entering data.
 
                        When an authorization entry is created or edited, a
                        special popup appears for each login (private, global,
                        or both) which is entered, on which you must supply
                        the password for that login.  The password is entered 
                        twice, and the two entries must be identical before 
                        it will be accepted.
 

        Destroy         The entry under the cursor is destroyed.  Your must 
                        respond to a "Do you really mean it"  prompt;
                        if the response is positive, the entry under the 
                        cursor is destroyed.  Whenever a vnode entry is 
                        destroyed, all detail entries for the same vnode are 
                        automatically destroyed as well.
 
        Edit            The entry under the cursor is edited.  In the case of
                        a detail record, the same popup as the one originally 
                        used for entering the data is brought up for editing, 
                        with the fields pre-filled with the current values.
                        If a login name is changed during an edit, you are
                        prompted to re-enter the password.
 
                        Selecting Edit with the cursor in the Virtual Node 
                        Name tablefield allows you to rename the vnode.
  
        Control         Selecting Control lets you perform network server 
                        control operations.

	Login		Upon selecting Login, the main screen ( a.k.a login
			screen ) is displayed. 

        Test            The connection indicated by the cursor is tested:  
                        NETUTIL attempts to connect to the name server on the 
                        indicated server system, and reports on its success 
                        or failure.

        Help            Displays this help screen.

        End             Exit NETUTIL.
