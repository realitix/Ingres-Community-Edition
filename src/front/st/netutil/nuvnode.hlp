/#-- NETUTIL, top frame, Virtual Node Name (vnode) tablefield subtopic
/#--
Upon entry to NETUTIL, this field displays a vertical list of all virtual
node names for which either a login entry, a connection entry, or both, 
is defined.  

It should be noted that this tablefield does not correspond to any table 
that is part of the actual database which is administered by NETUTIL.  
It is merely an abstraction intended to make the user interface more 
comprehensible.  Therefore, it is possible to create an entry in the 
vnode tablefield with no corresponding detail information.  Although such 
an entry will, in effect, disappear on exit from NETUTIL since there is 
no place to record its existence.
