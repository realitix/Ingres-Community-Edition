  The log_esc_lpr_ut option controls the logging of lock escalations
  messages when the maximum number of locks per resource (MAXLOCKS as 
  defined by the "SET LOCKMODE" statement) is exceeded, with this 
  resource being a user table.

  The default is "OFF"; if the user wishes to see these escalation
  messages in the errlog.log, set the value to "ON".
