 PST stands for Prepared Statement Table. PST_MAX specifies the 
 maximum number of open cursors per transaction. If too small a 
 value is used, then additional overhead will be used to process 
 queries. The larger this value is specified, the more virtual 
 memory will be used by the gateway. The gateway uses the table  
 to retain information for prepared statements. 

 Default is 100 for Oracle and 128 for other gateways. 
 The minimum value is 50 for all gateways.
 The maximum value is 100 for Oracle and 255 for other gateways. 

 If the table entries are used up or the prepared information no
 longer needs to be retained in the gateway, the gateway will
 release and reuse the entries for other statements. For a large 
 application that uses REPEATED queries, performance will suffer 
 when the table entries are used up and the statements need to be 
 re-prepared, which defeats the purpose of REPEATED queries. In this 
 case, you should break up large applications into smaller applications.
