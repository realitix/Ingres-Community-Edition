Sets the maximum number of seconds for the Name Server to wait when checking 
the status of a local server, such as the DBMS or Net Server. The Name Server 
periodically checks whether the local servers are available for connections.  
This activity is called "bedchecking".  The minimum setting is one second, 
the maximum is sixty seconds, and the default is 20 seconds.
