  The offline_error_action parameter specifies how the RCP should handle
  errors during RCP startup, offline REDO/UNDO recovery processing,
  after an abnormal shutdown.

  Valid values are: 

  continue_ignore_table: Mark the table inconsistent and continue recovery on
		         all other tables in the database. The database will
			 be marked TABLE/INDEX inconsistent.
		         A table rollforward will be required to make the
		         database consistent.

  continue_ignore_db:    Mark the database inconsistent, do not bring down the 
		         installation. A database rollforward will be required
		         to make the database consistent.

  stop:                  Bring down the installation rather than mark any
		         database inconsistent. Messages in the error log
		         and the RCP log file may help diagnose the recovery 
		         problems. If the problem is resource or environment
		         related, the problem should be fixed before the
		         installation is restarted.
