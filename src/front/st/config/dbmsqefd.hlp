  The qef_qep_mem resource specifies the maximum amount of memory which
  can be allocated by the Query Execution Facility (QEF) for building 
  data segment headers within DBMS servers created with this definition.

  This resource is deprecated;  the qef_dsh_memory resource should be
  defined in its place.  If both are defined, qef_qep_mem is ignored.
