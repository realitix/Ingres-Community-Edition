The opf_new_enum parameter determines whether greedy enumeration is 
used (ON) or not (OFF).

The default value is ON.

Greedy enumeration reduces the time taken to optimize and compile large
queries (involving large numbers of tables and/or potentially useful
indexes - typically more than 10). In some fringe cases non-greedy
enumeration may provide a better query plan.

Greedy enumeration can be enabled or disabled at the session level
by using: SET JOINOP [NO]GREEDY
