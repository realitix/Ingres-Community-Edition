The domain is the host name of the local installation as described in DNS.
Note that the domain may or may not correspond to the host name of the
Key Distribution Center (KDC) for Kerberos.  The Name Server uses the
domain name to construct the Kerberos service principal for the local machine.

Note that the full host name must be specified, for example:
   myHost.myDNSDomain.com
not:
   myHost

Your local host name must not resolve to 127.0.0.1 (localhost), but must 
resolve to the TCP/IP (remotely accessible) address.
