  The qef_hash_wbsize resource controls the size of the buffers used
  to write spilled rows during large hash joins or hash aggregations.
  Hash join uses these write buffers for bucketing and hash table space
  as well.  Larger buffers may reduce I/O operations and reduce spill file
  fragmentation, at the expense of using more memory.  Very large buffers
  may also impede the ability of hash join to tune itself for varying
  sizes of input.

  Write buffer sizes should range between 16Kb and 256Kb for most
  general use situations.

  The default is 16 Kb.  The minimum size is 8 Kb.
