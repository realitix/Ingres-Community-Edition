By default, Ingres applications use the syntax "vnode::database" to connect 
to remote installations.  The "remote_vnode" configuration option allows 
applications to bypass this syntax.

If remote_vnode is defined, and matches the name of a vnode name in the 
netutil database, the "vnode::" portion of the connection string can be 
omitted, and only the database name is required.  Applications will connect 
remotely, but the connection string appears to be a local connection.
