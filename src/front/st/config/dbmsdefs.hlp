  The define_address resource specifies whether the Ingres variable
  II_DBMS_SERVER will be defined for DBMS servers created with this
  definition.

  On non-VMS systems, Ingres variables are created as entries in the
  file $II_SYSTEM/ingres/files/symbol.tbl.  On VMS systems,
  II_DBMS_SERVER is defined in the GROUP or SYSTEM logical name table.

  If II_DBMS_SERVER is defined in the user's environment, all connection
  requests to Ingres databases will be routed by default to the DBMS
  server identified by the listen address stored in II_DBMS_SERVER.
