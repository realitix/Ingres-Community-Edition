 List of dynamically-loaded mechanisms.  Use commas to separate the items in 
 the list.  Note that static mechanisms such as null, system, or Ingres are not 
 allowed.  A setting of "none" means that dynamic mechanisms are not loaded.  
 A setting of blank (null string) will load the installation (default) 
 mechanism list, if defined.  See the Security section.
