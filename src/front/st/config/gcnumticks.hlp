  The gc_num_ticks resource gives the number of group-commit checks that
  will be performed on a buffer before writing it.

  When a log buffer write is being delayed for group-commit, the group-
  commit thread wakes up periodically to check whether the buffer has
  been written, or should be written.  If the buffer has not yet been
  written after gc_num_ticks checks, the group-commit time expires and
  the buffer is written.  (Each nap between checks is gc_interval milli-
  seconds long.)

  The default is 5 ticks.
