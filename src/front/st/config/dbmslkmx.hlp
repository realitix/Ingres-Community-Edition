  The system_maxlocks resource specifies the default system setting used
  to determine the maximum number of page or row locks that will be taken
  on a table before locking escalates to a table lock. The total number of
  locks available depend on locking system configuration.

  This default setting is only used if no SET LOCKMODE MAXLOCKS statement 
  was issued, or if one has been issued with the MAXLOCKS=SYSTEM parameter.

  The default is 50.  The minimum setting is 10.
