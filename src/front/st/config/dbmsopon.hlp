  The opf_old_cnf resource controls whether the optimizer will use old
  style "conjunctive normal form" algorithms, compatible with Ingres 6.4.

  If ON, boolean expressions composed of AND's inside OR's (such as
  ((x1 AND y1) OR (x2 AND y2)) will always be converted to OR's
  inside AND's.  This conversion can result in a exponentially larger
  expression, and may cause an "expression too complex" error.

  If OFF (the default), the OR-to-AND conversion is only attempted when
  the resulting expression is not too large;  otherwise, the original
  expression is used, even if it results in less efficient query
  plans.
