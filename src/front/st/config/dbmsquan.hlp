  When using internal (Ingres) threads:

    The quantum_size resource specifies the number of CPU milliseconds after
    which a session may be rescheduled within DBMS servers created with
    this definition.  Sessions may be rescheduled sooner than quantum_size
    if they have to wait for I/O or for some shared resource.

    The default of 1 second favors CPU-bound sessions.  Lower values for
    quantum_size may cause more reschedules and overhead, but may result
    in better responsiveness and balance between CPU-bound and I/O-bound
    sessions.

  When using operating system threads:

    The quantum_size resource specifies the minimum number of CPU 
    milliseconds between asynchronous polls to see if the front-end client
    has sent a message (such as an abort / interrupt message).
    Lower values for quantum_size will cause extra polling overhead,
    but will make the server respond to external interrupts more quickly.

  The default setting is 1000 milliseconds (or one (1) second).
