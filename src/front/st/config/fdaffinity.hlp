  The fd_affinity resource determines if the Server will open
  one file descriptor (FD) per file, shared by all threads (FILE), 
  or one file descriptor per thread per file (THREAD).
  Specifying THREAD may improve I/O throughput under heavy,
  concurrent load, but is not supported by all platforms, nor when
  the DBMS is configured for INTERNAL threads.

  The default is THREAD.
