  The rule_upd_prefetch specifies whether a rule fired by an update
  will prefetch the rows on which it is to act. 

  If the rows are not prefetched and execution of the rule causes rows
  to move due to changes in the primary key (or it is not possible to 
  perform in-place replace operations due to compression differences),
  the rule will loop until the row is moved to a point in the table 
  which is earlier than the current position of the update cursor or
  qualifying expressions are no longer true. This can lead to spurious 
  errors or silent data corruption as the number of times the rule is 
  executed can not be guaranteed.

  The prefetch operation introduces an overhead. This overhead is required
  to guarantee consistent behaviour for rules fired by an update.
  Setting this parameter to OFF will improve the performance of rules
  fired by updates. If set to OFF, it is the user's responsibility to
  ensure appropriate measures are taken to ensure rules fired by updates
  produce the expected behaviour.

  The default is ON.
