  The opf_sort_factor resource specifies the factor by which query
  "sort cost" estimates are adjusted.  The speed of the machine may
  cause sort nodes estimates to be consistently too high or low.  If
  necessary this factor may be reduced with caution.

  Default is 100.  Any adjustment of this number will have an inversely
  proportional effect on sort cost estimates.  i.e. setting it to 200 
  will halve cpu estimates of sort cost nodes.
