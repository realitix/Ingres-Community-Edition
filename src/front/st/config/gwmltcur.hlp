 For MS SQL Server, usage of multiple open cursors can lead to 
 performance problems with the gateway. If you do not need to use 
 multiple open cursors in your application, set this parameter to OFF. 
 This option should be used with caution as it requires an in-depth 
 understanding of the application and the effects of setting this 
 parameter on the specific application.

 Valid values are:

 ON -- Multiple open cursors are supported. (This is the default.)

 OFF -- Disables support for multiple open cursors for performance; valid 
 only if applications connecting to the gateway do not make use of 
 multiple open cursors.
