 Prior to MS SQL Server 2005, the result of a special-syntaxed UNION 
 select is truncated to zero length if an empty string ('') is specified
 in the first select and host variables are used in the WHERE clause.
 This is Microsoft bug 308264. An example is:

    SELECT '' from tab1 
    UNION 
    SELECT col1 from tab1 
    WHERE col1 = :var1; 
 
 The UNION_ZEROLENGTH_COLUMN_PADDING parameter was created to force the 
 length of the result and hide the bug found in SQL Server 7 and 2000.
   
 Default for UNION_ZEROLENGTH_COLUMN_PADDING is 255. Maximum is 8000.  

 Setting the value to zero will turn off the forced padding. 
 This parameter has no effect on SQL Server 2005 or above.
