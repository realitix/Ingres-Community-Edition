  The dmf_tcb_limit resource is the maximum number of Table Control Blocks
  (TCB's) that the Data Manipulation Facility will allow in memory at one
  time.  Every table active in a query requires a TCB.  Building a TCB is
  a relatively expensive operation, so DMF attempts to retain them in
  memory even if the table is not currently in use.  When dmf_tcb_limit
  is reached, DMF will replace the oldest unused TCBs to make room for
  new ones.

  The limit includes base tables, physical partitions, and secondary
  indexes in any database. The limit must be set high enough to allow
  for all TCB's actively needed by all active queries, or one or more
  queries will fail with errors.

  An excessively low limit will cause extra runtime overhead as TCB's
  are rebuilt over and over.  An excessively high limit wastes DMF memory,
  possibly at the expense of other DBMS server facilities.

  The default is 10000 TCB's.
