  The qsf_guideline resource controls the default size of the Query Storage
  Facility (QSF) memory pool.  The possible values are:

  small -  A low-memory setting suitable for lightly used installations
           that do not use complex queries, views, or database procedures.

  medium - An intermediate setting that allows for all but the most complex
           queries, and is suitable for moderate user loads.

  large -  A setting suitable for installations with many complex queries
           and hundreds of users.

  huge -   A very large memory setting, appropriate for dedicated servers
	   with lots of memory supporting hundreds of users.

  The qsf_guideline resource only controls the QSF memory default.
  The qsf_memory setting can still be tuned to best suit the installation.


  The default is "medium".
