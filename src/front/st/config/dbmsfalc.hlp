  The fallocate parameter controls the use of the fallocate() system
  call, on systems that implement it.  If ON, when a table is being
  loaded, table allocations (extends) will use fallocate to pre-
  allocate disk space for the total amount of the extension.
  This may slow down the load somewhat, but will usually result in
  better disk layout of the table, especially under highly concurrent
  loads, or when the table is partitioned.

  Fallocate is usually left OFF for interactive or OLTP usage.  It can
  be useful to turn fallocate ON for concurrent or partitioned data
  warehouse or data archiving usage.  If the platform or filesystem
  does not support fallocate(), turning the parameter ON will have no
  effect.

  The default is OFF.
