 For both MS SQL Server and DB2 UDB Gateways, the squeeze function
 cannot both remove embedded white spaces and return a dynamic
 length based on length of the parameter to the squeeze function.
 Because of this limitation, a squeeze_len parameter is provided
 to allow configuration of the number of bytes the squeeze
 function will return.

 Default for squeeze_len is 30 bytes.  

 By specifying a squeeze_len of zero, only white spaces in the front 
 and rear of the squeeze string are removed. None of the white spaces 
 in the middle are removed. When squeeze_len is zero, the output string 
 length returned by the squeeze function will be no longer than the 
 input string length.
