  The rep_iq_lockmode resource defines the locking level to use for the
  Replicator input queue table.  Valid values are "row", "page", "table",
  or "user".  "User" means that the lock level should be inherited from
  the user transaction that is inserting into the input queue.

  Row locking requires that the input queue have a page size of
  4K or larger.  If the input queue table uses the 2K page size,
  a request for row-locking is silently ignored and page-locking is used
  instead.

  The default is "user".
