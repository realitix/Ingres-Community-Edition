  The opf_pq_partthreads resource controls the number of threads that
  will be used to process partitions of a partitioned table. Parallelizing
  a partitioned table access is considered to consume one thread from 
  the separately defined degree of parallelism, but will actually 
  create as many threads as defined by this parameter.

  The default is 8 threads per partitioned table access.
