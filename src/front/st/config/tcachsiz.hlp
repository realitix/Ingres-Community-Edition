 Defines the number of entries in the buffer manager closed-table cache.
 
 It determines how many tables will be cached even though they are 
 closed ( to enable pages relating to these to remain in cache even though 
 they are not in use ).  This caching mechanism is only needed when running
 with multiple private caches.

 If the DBMS servers are running in sole-server or shared cache modes,
 closed tables are not automatically purged from memory unless they are
 iidbdb catalogs or core system catalogs.  Therefore, this resource
 will be of little interest to most non-cluster installations.


 Default: 40
