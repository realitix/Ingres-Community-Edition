  The stack_size resource specifies the amount of stack memory allocated
  for each session within DBMS servers created with this definition.

  Very complicated queries, deeply nested rule invocations, and other
  complex situations may require a larger than normal stack_size.


  The default is 150 Kbytes (256 Kb for 64-bit servers).
