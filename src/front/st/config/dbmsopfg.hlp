The opf_greedy_factor resource allows the adjustment of plan fragment costs,
allowing optimal query plans to be chosen.

The default value is 1.0, which has no affect. Setting opf_greedy_factor to
< 1.0 will allow plan fragments to be considered that are more expensive than
the current best plan fragment.
