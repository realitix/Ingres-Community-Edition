  The degree_of_parallelism resource controls the maximum number of threads
  used by DMF for parallelized MODIFY and CREATE INDEX operations.
  Partitioned table modifies and parallel create index statements are
  among those affected by this resource.  Larger values may improve
  performance on machines with many CPU's and plentiful disk resources.
  A value of zero forces serial execution, which may improve the on-disk
  layout of the resulting table files in some situations.

  This resource does not control parallel DML queries, such as select,
  insert, update, or delete.  See the opf_pq_dop resource for controlling
  DML parallelism.

  The default is 4 threads.
