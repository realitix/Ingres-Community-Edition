Delegation provides an alternate method of acquiring and forwarding 
authentication.  When delegation is configured, the Name Server generates 
authentication certificates as if it were the client.  This method requires 
Kerberos to be configured as both the local and remote authentication 
mechanism.  The client process generates an authentication certificate for the 
local Name Server.  The local Name Server, in turn, uses its delegation 
capabilities to generate an authentication certificate, and forwards the 
certificate on behalf of the client to the remote Name Server.
 
If delegation is not enabled, or Kerberos is not configured as the local 
authentication mechanism, then the Name Server cannot generate the remote 
authentication certificate. Instead, the client acquires the authentication 
certificate prior making the remote connection.  The client then forwards the 
credentials directly to the remote Name Server.  Either method is valid for 
making secure connections via Kerberos.
