 The on_error parameter contains the type of action to take when a non-fatal
 error within the auditing system has occurred. Valid actions are the following:

       SHUTDOWN  - Shut down the Ingres DBMS server. New DBMS servers will 
                   NOT start until problem with the security audit log has been
		   resolved.

       STOPAUDIT - This allows the Ingres installation to continue running
		   but shuts down auditing. Auditing will restart automatically
		   once the current audit log is once again available for 
		   writing.
