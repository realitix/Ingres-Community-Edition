  The log_readnolock resource specifies if readlock = nolock errors
  should be logged. Specifically, if readlock = nolock and the isolation 
  level is not READ UNCOMMITTED, Ingres will still follow the lock 
  protocols defined by your current isolation level, however the transaction 
  isolation level is actually READ UNCOMMITTED if you open a readonly cursor 
  which will scan the table without any locks.

  This resource specifies if an error should be logged if the 
  readlock=nolock REDUCES the transaction isolation level to READ UNCOMMITTED.
  The default is log_readnolock = OFF.
