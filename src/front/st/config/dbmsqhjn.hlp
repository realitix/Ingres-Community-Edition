  The qef_hashjoin_min resource sets the minimum amount of memory to be
  reserved by any one hash join operation.

  Normally, memory is reserved based on the optimizer row estimates, the
  number of hash join and aggregation operations in the query, and the
  qef_hash_mem setting.  If the optimizer row estimate is too low, a
  hash join may be under-reserved, causing spillage and poor performance.
  If under-estimation is common for some reason, the qef_hashjoin_min
  resource can be used to set a minimum reservation per hash join.
  A zero value means "no specific minimum".

  Excessive values of qef_hashjoin_min (more than a few megabytes) can
  unbalance the reservation algorithms and cause poor performance, excessive
  memory usage, or "QEF out of memory" errors.

  The default is zero, no guaranteed minimum.
