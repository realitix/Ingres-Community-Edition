 The on_log_full parameter determines the type of action that occurs if no
 further security audit logs are available.  
 
 The following values are allowed:

       SHUTDOWN  - Shuts down the Ingres DBMS server. New DBMS servers 
                   will NOT start until the problem with the security audit 
                   log has been resolved.

       STOPAUDIT - This allows the Ingres installation to continue 
                   running but shuts down auditing. Auditing will restart 
                   automatically once the current audit log is once again 
                   available for writing.

       SUSPEND -   Logically suspends requests to write audit records whilst
                   allowing users with MAINTAIN_AUDIT to continue to write 
                   records. Write operations performed by privileged users
                   may cause max_log_size to be exceeded.
