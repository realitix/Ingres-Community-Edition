  The cache_guideline resource controls the default sizes of the DMF
  buffer caches.  The possible values are:

  small - A low-memory setting suitable for very light usage.

  medium - An intermediate setting that balances performance and memory
           usage, for moderate loads.

  large - A setting suitable for heavily loaded installations with many users.

  huge - A very large memory setting, appropriate only for dedicated servers
         with lots of memory and very heavy loads.

  The cache_guideline resource only controls the Configurator defaults.
  Individual buffer cache settings can still be tuned to best suit the
  installation.


  The default is "medium".
