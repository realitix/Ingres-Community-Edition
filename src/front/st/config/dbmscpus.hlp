  The cpu_statistics resource specifies whether all sessions will maintain
  accurate CPU time data.  This resource is only relevant for internal-
  threads servers;  servers running OS threads rely on the OS to maintain
  session CPU time data.

  Maintaining accurate CPU times for internal-thread sessions causes a
  certain amount of overhead at each context switch.  Therefore, the default
  is OFF.  If a session does something that requests CPU time, such as a
  DBMSINFO('_cpu_ms') call, that session will start tracking CPU time;
  but CPU time up to that point will not be accurate unless cpu_statistics
  has been set ON.
