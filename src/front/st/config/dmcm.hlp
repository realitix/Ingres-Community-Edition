Enabling Distributed Multi-Cache Management (DMCM), provides fast commit when 
running in a multi-cache environment. It will provide a performance benefit 
when compared to a standard multi-cache installation. It should not be used as
a replacement for those installations that currently use shared-cache and fast
commit.
