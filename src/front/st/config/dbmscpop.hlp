  The batch_copy_optim resource determines whether a copy optimization
  is used when executing batched inserts. This optimization is only effective
  for prepared inserts submitted to the DBMS in a batch (in Java this is
  activated with the addBatch and executeBatch methods on prepared 
  statements).This optimization converts insert statements into a "COPY"
  operation internally in the DBMS; the result is that the batch may run 
  significantly faster. The optimization is faster only for larger batch 
  sizes; very small batches (of less than 50) may actually run more 
  slowly. This value may be over-ridden on a per-session basis using the
  "SET [NO]BATCH_COPY_OPTIM" statement.

  Valid values :
        ON		Optimization is used unless over-ridden by the session
        OFF     Optimization is not used unless over-ridden by the session
		
  Default value: ON
