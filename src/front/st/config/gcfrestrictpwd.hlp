 The restrict_pwd_auth setting determines which mechanism are used by default
 to generate authentication certificates for password authorization.  Explicit
 mechanisms other than those configured can be requested programatically to
 generate certificates.  When unrestricted, the mechanism used to produce a
 certificate is also used to validate the certificate.  Restricting
 authentication means that only certificates produced by the configured
 mechanism will be validated; others will automatically be rejected.
