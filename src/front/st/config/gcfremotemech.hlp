 Mechanism for distributed authentication.  Example: kerberos.  Only          
 one mechanism is allowed.  Login and password information for a remote       
 dbms are not required if you define this field.  Both the client and         
 remote dbms must support the specified mechanism.  A value of "default"      
 will load the installation (default) security mechanism.  See the            
 Security section.  A value of "none" disables remote authentication.
