  This form can be used to modify listen address information or enable
  specific protocols for the selected Net or DAS (Data Access)
  server definition.

  For a Net or DAS server to use a supported protocol, it must have 
  a valid listen address assigned to it which is unique with respect to
  the listen addresses assigned to other Net or DAS servers for the
  same protocol.

  TCP/IP protocols allow "rollups".  Rollups mean that more than one
  Net or DAS server can be started using the same port code.

  TCP/IP ports can be set to port codes that are hashed into port numbers,
  or the port number can be explicitly configured.

  The following port codes allow rollups: 

  1. The format "XX", where:
      a.  The first character is a letter.
      b.  The second character is a letter or number.  

  Generally "XX" is set to the value of II_INSTALLATION, but any value 
  conforming to this format is a valid port code.  A typical example
  is the port code "II".

  2. The format "N[N]+", where:
      a.  N is a series of numbers representing a physical
          port number.
      b.  The last character is a plus sign "+".

  An example of a port number that rolls up is "21064+".

  3.  The format "XXn[n]+", where:
      a.  The first character is a letter.
      b.  The second character is a letter or a number.
      c.  The third and optional fourth character represent a number
          from 1 through 14.
      d.  The last character is a plus sign "+".

  CBF automatically adds a plus sign to the installation code if the start 
  count is greater than one.

  Port codes can be configured as port numbers or as port codes that do
  not roll up.  

  The following port codes do not allow rollups:

  1.  The format "XXn[n]", where:
      a.  The first character is a letter.
      b.  The second character is a letter or a number.
      c.  The third and optional fourth character represent a number
          from 1 through 15.

  The DAS server is set to the value of II_INSTALLATION plus the
  number 7 by default (example: "II7"). 

  2. The format "N[N]", where:
      a.  N is a series of numbers representing a physical
          port number.

  An example of a port number that does not roll up is "21064".

  Refer to the Ingres Connectivity Guide for details on the syntax of
  Net and DAS server listen addresses for specific protocols.
