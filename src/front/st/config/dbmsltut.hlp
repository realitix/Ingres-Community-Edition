  The log_esc_lpt_ut option controls the logging of lock escalations
  messages when the maximum number of locks per transaction is exceeded,
  with this resource being a user table.

  During escalation, two lock messages get generated:  the first provides
  information about the lock list status, lock request flags, current
  lock count, and maximum locks allowed; the second provides details as 
  to which table and database the escalation will occur on.  This option 
  controls the logging of the second message.

  The default is "OFF"; if the user wishes to see these escalation
  messages in the errlog.log, set the value to "ON".
