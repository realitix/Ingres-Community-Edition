  The qef_no_dependency_chk specifies whether a dependency check
  should be performed when user runs a modify statement. 

  If set to ON, not performing dependency check will cause some 
  constraints to be dropped by the modify statement. For example, 
  a constraint defined as using the base table structure will be 
  dropped. 

  If set to ON, it is the user's responsibility to rebuild the 
  desired constraints after the modify statement has been run.  

  The default is OFF.
