  The qef_dsh_memory resource controls the maximum size of the general QEF
  (Query Execution Facility) memory pool.   All sessions allocate memory
  from this memory pool during query execution;  there is no individual limit
  on how much DSH memory any one session may allocate.  This memory pool is
  used for QEF work space as well as intermediate and final query variables.
  Sorting and hashing buffers are allocated from a different memory pool.

  A reasonable starting point for this resource is 50K to 100K per session.
  The number should be increased if very many sessions may be executing
  queries simultaneously, or if queries are very complex, or if many very
  wide columns are common in queries.
