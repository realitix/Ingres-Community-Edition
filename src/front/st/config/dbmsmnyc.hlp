  Old versions of Ingres would allow character strings containing
  currency symbols to be used in calculations. Current type resolution
  rules generate errors unless the string values are explicitly cast as
  money.

  The money_compat option allows the user to enable the old type
  resolution for string constants that contain a valid currency 
  symbol (leading or trailing).

  The default is "OFF"; if the user wishes to allow string constants
  to be checked for money values, set the value to "ON".
