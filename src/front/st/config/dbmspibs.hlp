  The pindex_bsize resource sets the size in rows of the exchange buffers
  used to pass data between parent and child threads when doing a
  parallel index.  The exchange buffer is filled by the parent thread
  doing the base table scan, and read by the child threads extracting
  the secondary index columns.

  The default is 5000 rows.  The minimum setting is 100 rows.
