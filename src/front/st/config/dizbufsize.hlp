  The di_zero_bufsize resource controls the size (in bytes) of the
  buffer used for zeroing space on disk.

  Disk space is zeroed when allocating or extending table files.
  A larger zero-buffer may increase the chances of getting a more
  contiguous file on disk, which can improve table-scanning performance.
  The effects of a larger zero-buffer will depend on many operating
  system related factors, such as filesystem allocation policies,
  write request maximum size, concurrent activity, and so on.

  A large zero-buffer size is only likely to be useful with tables that
  have an equally large ALLOCATION= or EXTEND= setting.

  This parameter is only used on Unix-like platforms;  it is not used
  on Windows or VMS.

  The default is 1 megabyte (1 MiB).
