  The online_error_action parameter specifies how the RCP should handle
  errors during pass abort processing.

  If a dbms server gets an error during rollback, it sends a pass abort 
  signal to the RCP. The RCP then attempts to rollback the transaction.

  This parameter specifies how the RCP should handle errors that occur 
  during pass abort processing.
  
  Valid values are: 

  continue_ignore_db: Mark the database inconsistent, do not bring down the 
		      installation. A database rollforward will be required
		      to make the database consistent.

  stop:               Bring down the installation rather than mark any
		      database inconsistent. 
		      Use this value to avoid database rollforward.
		     
		      Error messages in the error log and the RCP log file
		      may help diagnose the recovery problems. If the problem
		      is resource or environment related, the problem should
		      be fixed before the installation is restarted.

		      Also, recovery errors can be better handled during
		      RCP startup because offline recovery supports
		      offline_error_action: continue_ignore_table.
