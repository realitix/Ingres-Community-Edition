  The ambig_replace_64compat resource controls the behavior of a
  correlated update (UPDATE .. FROM) in certain circumstances.

  Consider a correlated update such as:

      UPDATE a FROM b
          SET some_column = 1
          WHERE a.other_column = b.other_column

  If multiple "b" rows join to one "a" row, the update is potentially
  ambiguous;  multiple replacements to the same "a" row occur, even
  though they all have the same effect (setting some_column to 1).

  In this situation, if ambig_replace_64compat is OFF (the default),
  an ambiguous replace error is issued.  If however ambig_replace_64compat
  is ON, no error occurs since all replacements to a row do the same thing.
  (The latter is compatible with Ingres 6.4/05 and earlier versions,
  hence the resource name.)

  The default setting is OFF.
