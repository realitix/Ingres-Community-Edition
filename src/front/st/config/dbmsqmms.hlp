  The qef_max_mem_sleep resource controls the maximum time (in seconds)
  that QEF (Query Execution Facility) is allowed to nap waiting for
  memory resources.

  QEF can nap if there is a shortage in the sorting/hashing memory pool,
  and the query has not yet reached its own session limit (qef_sort_mem
  or qef_hash_mem).  The delay allows other active queries to proceed
  and perhaps free up memory for the waiting query.  Because the waiting
  query might be holding other resources (such as locks), it is unwise
  to wait too long or deadlocks may occur.

  Memory waiting can be disabled by setting this resource to zero;
  in that case, a memory shortage will produce an immediate out-of-memory
  error.

  The default is 30 seconds.
