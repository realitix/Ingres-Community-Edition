 The log_writer option specifies the number of threads to use when writing
 entries into the log file.

 If additional log buffers are used, more logwriter threads may be
 beneficial.  If dual logging is in use, each log buffer must be written
 to two places, so the number of logwriter threads should be doubled.
 All DBMS servers participate in log-writing, so the logwriter threads
 can be distributed across all the DBMS servers in the installation.

 Default: 1/5 the number of log buffers
