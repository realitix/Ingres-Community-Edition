 This is the main Configuration-by-Forms (CBF) screen. The list you see 
 displays the main components (System Components) of the current Ingres 
 installation.

 To modify any system component settings, use your arrow keys to scroll to the
 component to modify and choose "Configure" to change the settings. 

 The Configuration Name is a unique string that identifies the instance of
 a component type for multiple, named components.

 The startup count represents the number of instances of the corresponding 
 component that will be automatically activated when the current Ingres 
 installation has been started. In the case of Internet Communication, the 
 startup count represents the number of communication instances that will
 be activated per World Wide Web client.
