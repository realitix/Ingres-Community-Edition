  The system_timeout resource specifies the number of seconds a privileged
  user session must be inactive before its context is invalidated and any
  trasactions are rolledback.
  The value must be an integer greater than or equal to 0, where 0
  indicates no wait and -1 indicates no limit (wait indefinitely).
 
  Default: 300
