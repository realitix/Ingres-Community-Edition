  The qef_sort_mem resource controls the maximum amount of memory
  which can be allocated to any one session by the Query Execution Facility
  (QEF) for in-memory sorting.  If a query expects to have multiple
  sorts in progress, the qef_sort_mem allotment is evenly divided among
  them.  Any sort that does not fit within qef_sort_mem will be executed
  by the more general (but usually slower) disk-sorting facility.

  The total QEF sort memory limit server-wide is controlled by the
  related qef_sorthash_memory resource.


  The default is 1 Mb.
