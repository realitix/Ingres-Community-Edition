  When set to ON, the opf_stats_nostats_max resource causes OPF to
  apply a maximum row estimate for joins where one relation has
  statistics and the other does not. This maximum is defined as:
  <rows in relation with stats> * <rows in relation without stats>/
  <unique values in relation with stats>.

  This maximum can be scaled using opf_stats_nostats_factor which
  must be greater than 0.0 and less than or equal to 1.0.

  If this resource is OFF, the optimizer will assume that both relations
  to be joined have the same statistics.  In some cases when the relation
  with statistics is much larger than the one without, this can lead to
  excessive row estimates and poor query plans.  In many other cases
  the OFF algorithm is appropriate.

  The default value for opf_stats_nostats_max is OFF and the default
  value for opf_stats_nostats_factor is 1.0.
