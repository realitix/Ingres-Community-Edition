  The lock_limit resource specifies the maximum number of locks which can
  be allocated by the locking system.

  If configuring lock_limit for cluster operation, or if using DMCM or
  cache sharing, the default lock limit may be insufficient.  These
  configurations require page cache locks that persist beyond a given
  transaction.  In those cases, you should consider increasing
  lock_limit by the number of cache pages defined for the node.
