  The qef_sorthash_memory resource controls the maximum size of the QEF
  (Query Execution Facility) sorting and hashing memory pool.  Buffers
  for in-memory sorting, and hash probe areas for hash join and hash
  aggregation, are allocated from this memory pool.

  This resource has to be large enough to allow for all concurrently
  executing queries that do hashing operations or in-memory sorting.

  The default is one qef_sort_mem allowance for every session, plus one
  qef_hash_mem allowance for 1/5 of connected sessions.
