  The qef_hash_mem resource sets the maximum amount of memory that one
  session can use for performing hash operations in the Query Execution
  Facility (QEF).  Hash operations include hash joins and hash aggregation.

  The total QEF hash memory limit server-wide is controlled by the
  related qef_sorthash_memory resource.

  The default is 20 Mb.
