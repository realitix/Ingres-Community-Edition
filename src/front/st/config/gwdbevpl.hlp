DBEVENT_POLL_RATE governs the rate, in seconds, at which the gateway will 
poll for target DBMS events while waiting for user input. A DBEVENT_POLL_RATE 
of zero turns off Database Event Polling, such that when a Database event is 
raised, the Gateway client application will never be notified of that event.

Default for DBEVENT_POLL_RATE is 0.
