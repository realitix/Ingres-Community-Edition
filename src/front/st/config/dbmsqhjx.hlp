  The qef_hashjoin_max resource controls the maximum amount of memory
  reserved for any one hash join operation.  This may be useful in
  situations where qef_hash_mem is very high (100's of megabytes).

  Adding memory to a hash join does not necessarily make it faster;
  it only helps if the added memory can reduce overflow spillage.
  If qef_hash_mem is large, excessive memory might be reserved by
  queries without improving performance.  The qef_hashjoin_max
  resource puts a cap on the individual hash join reservation,
  preventing excessive memory usage.

  The default is zero, no per-join reservation cap.
