  The resource dmf_modify_limit is the maximum number of modified pages that
  can be left in the buffer manager.  If this limit is reached, and
  there are no write-behind threads in use or active in this cache,
  any modified buffer is written synchronously when a session is finished
  referencing it.

  When write-behind threads are in use for a cache, this resource has
  little effect;  the write-behind mechanism manages modified buffers,
  and it is controlled by dmf_wb_start, dmf_wb_end, and dmf_free_limit.

  The default is 75% of the cache size.
