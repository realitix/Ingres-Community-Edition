  The ulm_chunk_size resource controls the memory increment allocated by
  the Utility Memory (ULM) facility.  Whenever a memory pool runs out of
  space, at least ulm_chunk_size bytes of additional memory will be
  added to the pool (up to the memory pool limit).

  Larger values can speed up memory allocation.  Excessive values may cause
  premature exhaustion of memory pools, or even prevent the server from
  starting.

  Default: 512 Kbytes.
