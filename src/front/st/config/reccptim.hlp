  The cp_timer resource specifies the elapsed time between signaling
  consistency points.

  ( Consistency points will still be triggered by transaction log
    file space usage, if the usage interval is reached before the cp_timer
    expires ).

  The minimum, and the default, is 0.
  
  Specifying 0 means that no thread will be started in the 
  Recovery Server to perform this task;  all consistency points will be
  signalled based on Mb of transaction log used.
