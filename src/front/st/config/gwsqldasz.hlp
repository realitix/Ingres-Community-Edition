 The sqlda_size parameter specifies the default size that the gateway 
 allocates for a sqlda. The sqlda_size determines the maximum number of 
 columns allowed in a select list of a query. If more columns are 
 selected than the value set in sqlda_size, the gateway automatically 
 releases the current sqlda and allocates a new, larger sqlda to handle 
 the query result correctly. The sqlda_size setting should be set to 
 accommodate most queries to save wasted (unused) sqlda memory and to 
 avoid frequent memory deallocations and reallocations. 

 For example, if an application typically selects more than 50 columns, 
 set sqlda_size to 50 to save the amount of virtual memory used by 
 Enterprise Access. 

 Default for sqlda_size is 128. Minimum value is 50. Maximum value is 255.
