 The restrict_rem_auth setting determines which mechanism are used by default 
 to generate authentication certificates for remote authorization.  Explicit 
 mechanisms other than those configured can be requested programatically to 
 generate certificates.  When unrestricted, the mechanism used to produce a 
 certificate is also used to validate the certificate.  Restricting 
 authentication means that only certificates produced by the configured 
 mechanism will be validated; others will automatically be rejected.
