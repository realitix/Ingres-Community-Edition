 The cgi-bin_ref parameter is the Web server's CGI directory reference.

 If you refer to your CGI directory in a Uniform Resource Location (URL)
 format as "http://<Web_server_name_and_port_number>/cgi-bin," the value for 
 cgi-bin_ref must be "/cgi-bin."

 If you are not sure how your CGI directory is being referenced, please 
 consult your Web server configuration before continuing.

 This field is mandatory. The Ingres/ICE install process and 
 executing applications on your Web server will not work without a valid
 entry in this field.
