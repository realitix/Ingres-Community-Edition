  The archiver_refresh resource controls the duration of an archiver
  cycle.  If the archiver has processed archiver_refresh percent of
  the transaction log file, and there is still more to do, it will
  "refresh" -- close the current cycle and start a new one, thus
  updating the log file pointer, checking for new journals, and so on.

  The default is 10 (10%).
