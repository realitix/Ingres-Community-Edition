 The shared_buffer_count parameter configures the number of shared audit
 record buffers stored in the SXF shared memory segment.  It is only used
 when ii.*.c2.audit_mechanism is set to INGRES.  

 The default value is 10 if the DBMS connected_sessions is less than 5,
 otherwise the value is connected_sessions*2.

 Setting the value of this option to zero restores the previous system
 behavior of writing records directly into the single shared audit page.
