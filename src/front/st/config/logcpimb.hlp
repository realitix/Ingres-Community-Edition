  The cp_interval_mb defines the interval in MiB (2**20 or 1048576 bytes)
  between consistency points.  This is the amount of transaction log file
  space that must be written before a consistency point is signalled.

  The default is 40 Mb (scaled down if the transaction log is smaller
  than 320 Mb).
