  The sole_cache resource determines whether databases can be opened
  by DBMS servers using other, private DMF caches.  It is analogous to
  the sole_server resource, but is less restrictive:  sole_server says
  that a database may only be opened by one DBMS server at a time,
  while sole_cache says that a database may be opened by any of the
  DBMS servers as long as they share a DMF cache.

  One example where sole_cache might be preferable to sole_server is
  to allow the use of fast commit together with use of the fastload
  utility.  In this example, fastload would be run with its -cache_sharing
  option, specifying the same DMF cache name as the DBMS server(s) use.
  Sole_server would not be appropriate, as it would not allow fastload
  to access a database already open by some DBMS server.  Sole_cache
  would allow both fastload and a DBMS server to access the same database,
  while still permitting fast commit operation.

  If the DBMS servers in an installation do not share DMF cache,
  sole_cache is equivalent to sole_server.

  The default for sole_cache is ON, unless cluster or DMCM mode is also ON.
