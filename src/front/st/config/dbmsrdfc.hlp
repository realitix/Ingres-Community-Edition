  The rdf_col_defaults resource specifies the number of entries in the
  column default values cache in DBMS servers created with this definition.

  The column default values cache holds value defaults (values other than
  blank, zero, or null) as part of the Relation Definition Facility (RDF).

  The deprecated resource rdf_tbl_cols means the same thing as the
  rdf_col_defaults resource.  If both resources exist, rdf_col_defaults
  is used and rdf_tbl_cols is ignored.

  The default is 50.
