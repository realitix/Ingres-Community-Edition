  The qef_hash_cmp_threshold resource controls the row size at which
  hash join and hash aggregation will consider run-length compression
  of the rows during the operation.  Compression can fit more rows into
  memory and makes spill files smaller, at the expense of some CPU
  overhead.  Larger rows are more likely to benefit from compression,
  hence the threshold.

  The threshold applies only to the size of that part of the row which is
  NOT the join key columns (or hash aggregation group-by columns).

  To disable RLE compression during hash join / aggregation, set this
  threshold to zero.

  The default is 128 bytes.
