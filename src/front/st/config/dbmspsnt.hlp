  The psort_nthreads resource controls the number of worker threads used
  when parallel sorting.

  A machine with many CPU's and large sorts may benefit from more worker
  threads.  Too many threads will not help sorting and may even be slower
  due to contention.

  The default is 2 worker threads.
