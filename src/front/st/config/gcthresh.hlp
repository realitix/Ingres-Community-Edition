  The gc_threshold resource is the number of other updating transactions
  that must be active in the logging system to invoke group-commit.

  When a log buffer is to be written, and it is not full, and there are
  at least gc_threshold other transactions that might be able to write
  into the log buffer, the write is delayed and periodic group-commit
  checking starts for that buffer.  If the number of other transactions
  falls below gc_threshold at any group-commit check, the buffer is written.
  (The buffer would also be written if it became full, or if the check timer
  expired.)

  The default is 1.
