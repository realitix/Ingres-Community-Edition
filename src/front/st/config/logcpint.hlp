  The cp_interval resource specifies the interval between consistency 
  points taken by the logging system.  More precisely, cp_interval
  is the percentage of the transaction log(s) which must be full
  before a checkpoint is taken.

  This resource is deprecated;  the cp_interval_mb resource should be
  used instead.  If both are defined, cp_interval is ignored else 
  cp_interval may take values in the range of 1 to 100.
