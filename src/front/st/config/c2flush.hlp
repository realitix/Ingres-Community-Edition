 The force_flush parameter configures system behavior when an audit flush
 is requested, allowing sites to choose whether or not to force the
 audit log file to disk when a flush occurs.  

 This option is only used when ii.*.c2.audit_mechanism is set to INGRES.

 Choices are: 

        ON    Indicating that an audit flush operation ensures all queued
              audit records have been written to disk before returning.
              This is the default.

        OFF   Indicating that the audit flush causes all queued audit
              records to be written into the audit page(s), but that the
              pages are not forced to disk unless they are full.  This 
              value is only checked when ii.*.c2.shared_buffer_count is
              not zero.
