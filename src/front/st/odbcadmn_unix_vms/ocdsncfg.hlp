You are looking at iiodbcadmin's Data Source Configuration Page.

The iiodbcadmin screen consists of a single form with the
following entry fields:

        -----           --------
       
	Description     Any character string for convenient description of 
			the data source.

	WITH Options    The Enterprise Access (Gateway) WITH Options field 
			allows the passing of gateway specific parameters to 
			certain subsequent statements in a given connection.  
			When specifying options do not include the "WITH" 
			keyword and separate multiple options with a comma, 
			i.e. keyword=value,keyword=value. For example:

			    dcom_ct_option = `in area CASQLDEFAULT`

        Role Name,
	Role Password   A role id and its associated password can be
			entered if a role identifier has been defined
			that associates privileges with the role.

	Vnode           The virtual node (vnode) name known on the local 
			installation to identify a particular remote
	                database server installation.  Vnodes are defined by 
			the Netutil or Visual DBA programs.  The choice of 
			"(local)" indicates a selection of the local database.

	Database        The target database name.

	Server Type     The class of Net server accessing the database
	                server installation.  The default is "Ingres",

			database server installation is being accessed through 
			an Enterprise Access (Gateway) server, specify the 
			gateway server class (e.g. "IDMS").  

        Read Only       An entry of "Y" means that the database sessions 
			using this data source will reject attempts to 
			perform update operations.
