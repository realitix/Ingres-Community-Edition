You are looking at iiodbcadmin's Advanced Configuration Options Page.

The iiodbcadmin screen consists of a single form with the
following table fields:

  FIELD           SYNOPSIS
  -----           --------
       
  Cursor          A SELECT query generated via SQLExec, ExecDirect, or the 
  or Select       Execute method creates result sets.  If multiple rows are 
  Loops           to be fetched, the result set is traversed using a select 
		  loop or cursor loop. 

                  Select loops generally have the best performance, especially 
		  for fetching a large number of rows.  However, only one 
		  select loop can be active at a time.  Select loops may not 
		  be nested.  In direct ODBC code, SQLFreeStmt must be called 
		  before executing another select loop.

                  Cursors may be slower then select loops, but cursors place 
		  no limits on the number of active result sets.  Cursor loops 
		  may be nested.  

  Convert         Some applications fully qualify their column-name references 
  3-part          as ownername.tablename.columnname references.  Older Ingres 
  owner.table.-   6.4 based servers and gateways may not able to handle this 
  column to       form of the SQL syntax.  Selecting this option will cause 
  2-part          the ODBC driver to convert the ownername.tablename.columnname
  owner.table     references to tablename.columnname references.

  Include SYS*    By default, the ODBC driver filters out tables beginning 
  or "sys*"       with "SYS*" when the SQLTables() query is executed, as 
  SQLTables in    these are usually system (internal) tables.  Some users, 
  result set      however, wish to have such tables included in the result 
		  set, and therefore may select "Y" to enable the inclusion 
		  of "SYS*" tables.

  Return empty    By default, the ODBC driver returns the date value of 
  string date	  9999-12-31 23:59:59 for empty date values.  Some 
  values as       applications prefer to receive a more meaningful NULL value 
  NULL            when displaying an empty string date.

  Return DATE     Some MK (Manufacturing Knowledge) applications load their 
  "1581-01-01"	  database with a "magic" date of 1582-01-01 to indicate a 
  as NULL	  default beginning date.  However, this is meaningless to 
		  other applications that use the same date.  Selecting
		  "Y" means applications will receive a NULL value when 
		  fetching such a date.  

  Force separate  By default, the ODBC driver uses just one database session 
  session for	  for all ODBC functions.  Older releases of the ODBC driver 
  ODBC catalog	  used two sessions with a separate session for ODBC catalog 
  functions	  functions (SQLTables, SQLColumns, SQLPrimaryKeys, etc.).  
		  When selected, this option reverts to the older, less 
		  efficient behavior.  Only needed for compatibility issues 
		  where Select Loops were used and the application was 
		  relying on the separation of interleaved main and catalog 
		  function result sets.  Before using this option, try 
		  selecting the Cursor Loops option first to solve any 
		  compatibility issues.

  Ignore arith-   By default, a numeric overflow, underflow, etc. condition 
  metic errors    is an error.  When "IGNORE" is selected, the condition 
  overflow,       is ignored.  Equivalent to the -numeric_overflow=ignore 
  etc.		  command line flag.

  Support         When "Y" is selected, ODBC applications will evaluate the 
  II_DECIMAL      II_DECIMAL environment variable and use a comma if so 
		  specified.  In all other cases, the the ODBC defaults to 
		  a period character (".").

  Allow update    If selected, the ODBC driver will allow applications to 
  database	  execute database procedures that perform updates.  If the 
  procedures	  box is not checked, the default behavior is to reject 
  (Read-only	  execution of updating database procedures.  This applies 
  driver)	  only to Ingres databases later than Ingres II.

  Return NULL for This option causes the driver to return NULL for schema 
  SCHEMA columns  (owner) names for the ODBC catalog functions. 
  in result sets

		  WARNING:
		  
		  The option is not safe if a user has table t1 and the 
		  DBA also has a table t1 in the database.  There is no 
		  problem if user1 has a table t1 and user2 also has a 
		  table t1.  Table names returned are limited to those 
		  owned by the current user or DBA.  This avoids problems 
		  between user1 and user2, but not with the DBA.  Although 
		  SQLTables would work OK, ambiguities between user and DBA 
		  duplicate table names will cause failures on calls to 
		  SQLColumns, SQLPrimaryKeys, SQLSpecialColumns, etc. when 
		  this option is selected.

  Send Date/Time  Tells the Ingres ODBC driver acts as if the connection 
  as Ingres Date  target supports only Ingres dates; ANSI syntax for dates 
                  and timestamps will be ignored.
                  
                  WARNING:

                  This option must be specified if your application uses
                  empty dates! Failure to check this option may result in data
                  corruption or cause certain queries to return the wrong 
                  result.

                  Note: This option is intended primarily for customers
                  migrating from Ingres 9.1 and later, who use ingresdates.
                  This option will have no effect on Ingres releases prior to
                  Ingres 9.1. If the target table includes ansidates, your
                  query may not work if this option is enabled.

                  If this option is selected:
                      * All ODBC date and ODBC timestamp types are sent as 
                        strings.
                      * All ODBC date and ODBC timestamp escaped literals are 
                        sent as strings in the Ingres date format 
                        'YYYY_MM_DD 00:00:00' for dates and 
                        'YYYY_MM_DD HH:MM:SS' for timestamps.

                  If this option is not checked:
                      * All ODBC Date types are sent as the DBMS type ansidate.
                      * All ODBC Timestamp types are sent as DBMS type 
                        timestamp.
                      * All ODBC date escaped literals are sent as strings in 
                        ANSI format: DATE 'YYYY-MM-DD'
                      * All ODBC timestamp escaped literals are sent in
                        ANSI format: TIMESTAMP 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.[FFFFFF]'.

                  information about the ODBC's treatment of date and
                  timestamp sequence, including empty dates.
