You are looking at iiodbcadmin's Alternate Data Source Path Page.

The iiodbcadmin screen consists of a single form with an entry
field for specifying an alternate path for the ODBC data source
configuration file.  Enter the path and name of the target file.

All menu items apply to whichever tablefield contains the cursor when the 
item is activated.  The menu operations are:

        MENU COMMAND    SYNOPSIS
        ------------    --------

	Save            When data on the this page has been modified, a 
			popup menu appears asking for confirmation on whether 
			the specified path should be saved.  Entering "Y" 
			causes the path and file name to be referenced
			in further iiodbcadmin operations.

        Help            Displays this help screen.

        End             Exit iiodbcadmin.
