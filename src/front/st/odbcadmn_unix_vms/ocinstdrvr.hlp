You are looking at iiodbcadmin's Installed Drivers Page.

The iiodbcadmin screen consists of a single form with a table
listing the installed Ingres drivers found in the configuration path 
definition.  Non-Ingres ODBC drivers are not listed.

Note that new driver definitions may not be added in iiodbcadmin.  
Use the iiodbcinst utility to add new driver definitions.

The Path field lists the default path for the ODBC configuration files.
If the Ingres ODBC driver was installed with a path other than the
default, the Path field will display as "ALTERNATE".  Otherwise, the
default path is "SYSTEM".  

The Tracing field indicated whether or not ODBC tracing is enabled.

The Trace Path field indicates the current path and file used for ODBC
tracing.  You may edit this field to select a new path and file name.

All menu items apply to whichever tablefield contains the cursor when the 
item is activated.  The menu operations are:
