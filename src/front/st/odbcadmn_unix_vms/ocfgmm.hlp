/#-- ODBC configuration screen help file 
/#--
You are looking at iiodbcadmin's main menu.

The iiodbcadmin screen consists of a single form with a table
listing the ODBC data source definitions found in the configuration path 
definition.  Only Ingres data source definitions are displayed.

The Path field lists the default path for the ODBC configuration files.
If the Ingres ODBC driver was installed with a path other than the
default, the Path field will display as "ALTERNATE".  Otherwise, the
default path is "SYSTEM".  The "ALTERNATE" and "SYSTEM" paths indicate
the system-level definitions for the Ingres ODBC driver.  User-level
paths may be specified via the "Files" menu option.

All menu items apply to whichever tablefield contains the cursor when the 
item is activated.  The menu operations are:

        MENU COMMAND    SYNOPSIS
        ------------    --------

                        utility will provide popup displays for the
			data source name and driver name.  After
			successfully selecting the data source name and
			driver name, iiodbcadmin will display
			the ODBC Data Source Configuration Page.

                        If the response is positive, the entry under the 
                        cursor is destroyed.  Whenever a DSN entry is 
                        destroyed, all detail entries for the same DSN are 
                        automatically destroyed as well.

        Edit            Modify a DSN definition.  The ODBC Data Source
                        Configuration Page will be displayed for the entry 
                        under the cursor.

        Test            Test an ODBC connection.  The configuration data 
                        supplied in the ODBC Data Source Configuration Page 
                        will be used to attempt a connection to the database.  
                        A display popup will indicate success or failure of 
                        the connection attempt.
