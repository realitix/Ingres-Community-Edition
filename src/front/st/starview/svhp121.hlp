LDBHelp Command

This command is used to select a local database from a list of
local databases. The selected local database name is displayed in
the Database Name field of the Object Selection Criteria form.
The distributed objects displayed in the OBJECTS table field are limited 
to those whose underlying object is on the selected local database.
If asterisk ('*') is selected, all local databases are displayed.  

The SELECT command selects the highlighted local database 
and returns automatically to the Objects Selection Criteria form.  
The TOP/BOTTOM commands move the cursor to the top/bottom of the Local 
Databases list respectively. The FIND command searches for a specified 
string within the Local Databases list. The HELP command displays this 
screen, and the END command returns to the Objects Selection Criteria form 
without changing the Database Name field.
