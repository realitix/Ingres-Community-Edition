				'Node Name'. Use the NODEHELP command to 
				change this field.

Only distributed objects that meet all the criteria are displayed in 
the OBJECTS table field.

The Select command saves the current object selection criteria, updates
the display to meet the new criteria, and returns to the Distributed Database
Contents form.

The criteria may be modified by :

  1) Using the NODEHELP, LDBHELP, or OWNERHELP commands to modify
     the node name, local database name, or object owner respectively.
  
  2) Changing 'y' to 'n' (or 'n' to 'y') for any of the SHOW 
     criteria.

  3) Use SELECT to save the new criteria. The OBJECTS table field may change
     to meet the new criteria.
