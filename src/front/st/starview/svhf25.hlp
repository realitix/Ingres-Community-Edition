TEST LDB

This command is used to test the accessibility of local databases. Use
the SINGLELDB command to test the accessibility of the local database that
is currently highlighted. Use the ALLLDBS command to test the accessibility 
of all local databases of the current distributed database. 
The NEWLDB command can be used to test accessibility to a node or local
database that is not a part of the current distributed database. The NEWLDB
command prompts for a node and local database name. The SINGLELDB, ALLLDBS,
and NEWLDB commands return automatically to the Nodes and Local 
Databases menu when they have completed. The SINGLELDB, and ALLLDBS commands 
change the Stat field of the Nodes/Local Databases table from '?' to up/down 
if a local database is accessible or inaccessible.  The NEWLDB command displays
the accessibility of a local database in a separate popup dialogue box.  
The HELP command displays this screen, and the END command returns to the 
Nodes and Local Databases menu without performing any tests.
