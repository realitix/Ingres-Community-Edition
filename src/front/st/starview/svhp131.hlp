OwnerHelp Command

This command is used to select an object owner from a list of
object owners. The selected object owner name is placed into
the Object Owner field of the Object Selection Criteria form.
The distributed objects displayed in the OBJECTS table field
are limited to objects owned by the selected object owner.  
If asterisk (*) is selected, all owners are displayed.

The SELECT command selects the highlighted owner and returns automatically 
to the Objects Selection Criteria form.  The TOP/BOTTOM commands move the 
cursor to the top/bottom of the Owner list respectively. The FIND command 
searches for a specified string within the Owner list. The HELP command 
displays this screen, and the END command returns to the Objects Selection 
Criteria form without changing the Object Owner field.
