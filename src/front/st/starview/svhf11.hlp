STARVIEW

Select a distributed database by 1) typing in a name in the Distributed
Database field, or 2) listing distributed databases with the DDBHELP command and
moving the cursor to the desired distributed database. The Distributed Database
field reflects the current distributed database selected.  Once a distributed 
database has been selected, connect to it with the GO command. The GO command 
connects to the selected distributed database, and displays the Nodes and Local 
Databases form.

The TOP/BOTTOM commands move the cursor to the top/bottom of the Distributed
Database Name table field respectively. The FIND command searches for a 
string within the Distributed Database Name table field. The HELP command 
displays this screen. The QUIT command exits STARVIEW.
