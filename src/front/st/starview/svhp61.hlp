NodeHelp Command


This command is used to select a virtual node from a list of
virtual nodes. The selected node name is displayed in
the Node Name field of the Object Selection Criteria form.
The distributed objects displayed in the OBJECTS table field
are limited to objects whose underlying object is on the selected node.  
If asterisk ('*') is selected, all nodes are displayed.

The SELECT command selects the highlighted node and returns automatically 
to the Objects Selection Criteria form.  The TOP/BOTTOM commands move the 
cursor to the top/bottom of the Node Name list respectively. The FIND 
command searches for a specified string within the Node Name list. 
The HELP command displays this screen, and the END command returns to 
the Objects Selection Criteria form without changing the Node Name field.
