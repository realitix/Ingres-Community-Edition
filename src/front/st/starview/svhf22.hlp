TEST NODE

The TESTNODE command allows the testing of nodes that are part of
the current distributed database. The SINGLENODE command 
tests the accessibility of the virtual node currently highlighted.
The ALLNODES command tests the accessibility of all virtual nodes of the 
current distributed database. Both the SINGLENODE and the ALLNODES commands 
return automatically to the Nodes and Local Databases menu upon completion.
The Stat field of the Nodes/Local Database table changes from a '?' to
up/down if the node is accessible or inaccessible.
The HELP command displays this screen, and the END command 
returns to the Nodes and Local Databases menu without testing any nodes.

To test the accessibility of a node that is not part of the current distributed
database, return to the Nodes and Local Databases menu, and use the 
TESTLDB command, followed by the NEWLDB command. The NEWLDB command 
prompts for a node and local database name. Enter the name of the desired 
node when prompted for node name, and enter 'IIDBDB' when prompted for 
the local database name.  The accessibility of this node is displayed 
in a separate popup dialogue box.
