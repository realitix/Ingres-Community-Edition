Distributed Database Contents

The Distributed Database Contents form displays distributed object information 
of the current distributed database. The information displayed include the 
object name, object owner, and object type. The OBJATTR command displays
the object attributes of the highlighted object. Object attributes include 
information such as creation dates, and local/underlying object information. 
The BROWSE command allows the ISQL and/or Tables utilities to be invoked on 
a selected local database. Additionally, the BROWSE command allows
selected local objects to be registered in the current distributed database.
The REMOVE command deletes registrations from the current distributed
database (underlying local objects are not deleted). The CRITERIA command 
modifies the selection criteria of the displayed distributed objects - 
only objects meeting the all of selection criteria are displayed.
The TOP/BOTTOM commands move the cursor to the top/bottom of the OBJECTS 
table field. The FIND command searches for a specified string within the 
OBJECTS table field. The HELP command displays this screen, and 
the END command returns to the Nodes and Local Databases form.
