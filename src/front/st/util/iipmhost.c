**
**  Name: iipmhost.c -- writes string returned PMhost() to standard
**	output or a specified file. 
**
**  Usage:
**	iipmhost [[ -rad <radid> | -node <nodename> ] [ -local ]] [ outfile ] 
**
**  Description:
**	Writes local host name filtered by PMhost() to standard output or
**	a specified output file.  This executable is invoked as an external
**	procedure from the configuration rules system and is called by
**	package setup scripts to instantiate the host name component of
**	various configuration resources.
**
**	On a Clustered system, you may optionally pass a node name
**	(a not particularly useful identity operation ;-)), or a node alias,
**	with the '-node' parameter and the corresponding node name is echoed.
**
**	On a NUMA clustered host, you can pass a rad id with the -rad
**	parameter and the corresponding virtual node name is echoed.
**
**	For either of these options, if "-local" is passed, then valid
**	values for the '-rad' & '-node' arguments are restricted to
**	nodes defined on the local host machine.
**
**	If you do pass one of these three cluster options the status code
**	for this program will be set to FAIL on exit, and no hostname
**	is echoed if the values passed are not part of the cluster, or
**	if the local host is configured for NUMA clusters, and RAD context
**	was not set.  We take advantage of this in 'ipcclean' to make
**	sure that 'ipcclean' has a valid RAD context set before going
**	off and blitzing shared memory segments.
**
**
**  Exit Status:
**	OK	Succeeded.
**	FAIL	Couldn't open output file.
