;  SAMPLE INSTALLATION FILE WITH FORMAT NOTES
;
;  General Rules:
;       1) Items in brackets '[' or ']' denote keywords used to define
;	   sections of the install script or used to set internal flags.
;       2) Comment lines begin with ';'
;	3) Several pre-defined variables exist:
;	    %0% : Target directory for the installed product.
;	    %1% : In WINDOWS, the Windows directory; in OS2, the
;		  current directory on the active hard disk.
;	    %2% : In WINDOWS, the Windows System directory; in OS2, the
;		  OS2 DLL directory
;	    %3% : This is a bit flag representation of up to 32
;		  components (groups) that show up on the selection
;		  dialog.  Each bit, when 1 (starting from the lowest
;		  bit) represents the respective option selected.
;		  This can be used to pass the selection information
;                 to another program when EXEC'd by the installer.
;	    %4% : This is the drive of the target directory, to pass
;                 to exec's or calls primarily.
;	    %5% : The directory of the CA-APPS common tools.  Use this
;		  as the target drive when installing common tools such
;		  as CABL.DLL, etc.
;	    %6% : The source subdirectory.
;	    %7% : The boot drive.
;	    %8% : The response file name.
;           %9% : The machine (host) name for NT and Win95
;	    %{any letter}% : The directory specified in the [directory]
;		  section that matches that letter.
;	4) MAX Disks	   = 100
;	5) MAX Files	   = 10000
;	6) MAX Directories = 625
;
;   NOTE:   If you are using help in a multi-product installation and using
;           sub-scripts then you must have instos2.hlp file on the disk.
;	    CA-Install will look on the disk and will Initialize the help
;	    manager if it finds instos2.hlp. Otherwise, it will hide the help
;	    button.
;
;   NOTE:   The new version of CA-INSTALL (3.2) is mostly backward compatible
;	    with 3.0 and old scripts should be able to run without a problem.
;	    Largest number of changes are made in the products section for
;	    multi-product installation.
;	    If you are moving from 3.0 to 3.2 the following sections are
;	    changed. Please read the full discriptions of each section,
;	    compare the changes and then update your 3.0 script files.

; The BYPASSUI flag, when present, prevents the user info dialog box
; to come up.
;
;[bypassui]


; The BYPASSPID flag, when present, prevents the product ID field from
; being requested and displayed when asking for user info.
;
;[bypasspid]

; The NOTCOMPLETE keyword specifies that after the install product is
; finished we don't want to display an "Install Complete" message, since
; the user will be doing more installation work via execs.
;
;[not_complete]

; The SKIPWRITEKEY  keyword skips writing the keyfile information back
; to the ORIGINAL keyfile on the source disks.	This is important for
; products that will be installed from CD-ROM or other non-writable media.
; This flag is set automatically if cd-rom key word is used.
;
[skipwritekey]

; The CD-ROM  keyword makes all the destination files writeable and
; does not allow the writeback of key file and the log files.
; In other words it automatically sets the skipwritekey flag and
; overrides the creation of the log files.
;
;[CD-ROM]


; Use the BASIC_DLG key to bring up a dialog with the basic/advanced
; selection.

; The RESPONSE command specifies a filename which contains canned responses
; for the installer.  Look in the file RESPONSE.RSP for the syntax of
; response files.
;
[response]
"C:\RESPONSE.RSP"

; The SKIPCAPPS command bypasses the prompt for CA-APPS common directory.
; This should only be used if there are no common CA tools in your product,
; and you do not wish the product to be "registered" in CAI.INI.
;
[skipcaapps]

; The SKIPPLUGMSG skips the first message telling user to have a plug
; ready if the installation method requires plugs.
;
[skipplugmsg]

; The NOBACKLEVEL flag does not allow older versions of files to be
; installed - the user gets no indication that files have been skippped.
;
[nobacklevel]

; The USEMULTITITLE is used in multi-product installation. If it is used
; then "CA-Multiple product installation" is displayed as title on the
; product selection screen rather than the baseapp installation.
;[usemultititle]


;  The PRODUCTS keyword specifies which products are to be installed
;  for multiple product installations.	If there is only one product
;  to be installed, this keyword/section can be skipped, or it may

;  Once specified at least one pattern at offset 1-n must match.
;
;  If your product is compressed use the compressed offset and match
;  pattern as one pattern and the uncompressed as the other. This allows

;
; This is where you place the information about each file to be
; copied.
;
;
; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; NOTE:  There are two types of setup: Simple and Complex.
;
;        Simple:  Installs ALL files, like a batch file.  For this       
;                 setup, do not worry about "D" flags, "R" flags,
;                 or the <nn> flag.
;
;        Complex: Presents the user with a dialog box allowing
;                 them to install certain files.  All flags apply
;                 in this case.                
;
;        For Group (or Component) definitions, ALL fields are required.
;           For files following each group definition, only the first 6
;           fields are required.  There should always be at least one
;           group defined, using either the D, T, or R flag (these are
;           mutually exclusive).
;
; NOTE:  To install files spanning multiple disks the first file should have
;        normal paramter; e.g. "C" or "CD10IA" or "CR" etc. The remaining files
;        must have "S" in their parameter list; e.g. "CS". The "S" flag tells
;        CA-Install that this file is a part of a spanned file.
;
; Example of a spanned file:
;
;    "3","A","C","0","","BIGFILE.TXT","BIGFILE.001",""
;    "4","A","CS","0","","BIGFILE.TXT","BIGFILE.002",""
;    "5","A","CS","0","","BIGFILE.TXT","BIGFILE.003",""
;    "6","A","CS","0","","BIGFILE.TXT","BIGFILE.004",""
;
; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; Format:
;
; "n","prod","flags","d","idir","destfilename","srcfilename","PName",
;     "Description","Comment","size","finalsize", "iconfile","paramstr"
;
; n          : The disk number this file resides on
;
; prod	     : Product code which matches the product codes defined in the
;	       [products] section.  If there is no products section, this
;              value should be "A".
;
; flags      : Can be none, one, or many of the following:
;
;              R     : Required GROUP - Setup **will** copy all files
;                      in this group.
;              D     : Display this GROUP in the User Selection Listbox.
;              T     : Turn off selection of this item as a default, but
;                      show this in the list box as a group.
;              C     : Compressed file. Use the "real" filename in this .ISC
;		       file, setup will look for a filename with the last
;                      character of the extension == '_'.
;              Ic[t] : Add this program to ProgMan, group c. Group is A-Z
;		       t is an optional parameter that can be either W, P,
;		       or M (Windows, PM, or MS-DOS).
;              N     : Minimize the executeable on start. Only valid if 'I'
;                      paramter is specified to create icons. (Only for Windows)
;	       nn    : The next nn entries are part of the group to copy,
;		       for example, if there are four files for KillerApp,
;		       all of which you copy or you dont, then you
;		       would place 03 in this spot, and make the next
;		       three entries be the other three files. The user
;		       will see this entry as only one Object though.
;	       On    : (Optional) If the product already exists on the
;                      users computer this flag can be used to determine
;		       CA-Install actions:
;				    n = 0   Check time and dates of the
;					    source and destination files
;					    and then ask display a dialog
;					    box for overwrite instructions if
;					    the source file is older otherwise
;					    copy file. (default).
;				    n = 1   Always display a dialog box for
;					    instructions.
;				    n = 2   Replace destination file
;					    with source file.
;				    n = 3   Do not replace destination file
;					    with source file.
;	       V=n.nn: Install only if the operating system (i.e. Windows)
;                      is this version or later. If n='S', then this will
;                      check for the existence of Win32s, if n='N' this
;                      will check for NT, if n='C' this will check for
;                      Windows95 (Chicago).
;
;		       Examples:
;
;                      This example says "if running under Windows 3.0 then copy SPJWIN.EXE".
;                      "0","A","C07DIAV=3.0","0","","SPJWIN.EXE","CA-SuperProject","Program Files","CA-SuperProject program, help and report files","2550", "2550"
;
;		       Copy this file if the version number greater than 2.0
;                      "0","A","CV>2.0","0","","SPJLOGO.DLL",""
;
;		       The following is WRONG beacuse the version number and
;                      file count can't go together.
;                      "0","A","CV=3.007DIA","0","","SPJWIN.EXE","CA-SuperProject","Program Files","CA-SuperProject program, help and report files","2550", "2550"
;              S     : Necessary if the file is spanning multiple disks and this
;                      is not the first portion of the spanning file.
;
; d          : The destination directory. 0 = Parent, A-ZZ = Children, %5%
;              for common tools
;
; idir       : The directory on the install disk
;
; destfilename: The actual name of the file. 12 chars MAX. This can be blank
;               for the creation of empty sub-directories.
;
; srcfilename: The name of the file on disk. 12 chars MAX. (optional)
;
; PName      : The name of the Icon in Progman (required if D flag)
;              32 chars MAX.
;
; Description: (Group Definitions Only)
;              A short description, for the listbox entry (only if D flag)
;              20 chars MAX.
;
; Comment    : (Group Definitions Only)
;              The lengthy text displayed in the Comment box (only if D flag)
;	       80 chars MAX.
;
; size       : (Group Definitions Only)
;              Size of file/group actually copied in K
;
; finalsize  : (Group Definitions Only)
;              The ulitmate file size of file/group in K. Usually different if
;	       there are other processes which will expand or implode files
;	       after the install program is finished.  Another use is to
;	       account for the sector size of hard disks; for instance,
;	       20 files with a length of 10 bytes would show up in the
;              "size" parameter as 200 bytes (1K), but if installed on a hard
;	       disk with an 8K sector size the actual used space would be
;	       20 * 8K = 160K.
;
; iconfile   : Fully qualified path to an icon file name. It is only valid if
;              'I' parameter is used in the flags section. ( optional )
;
; paramstr   : The command-line parameters to attach to the program when
;              associating with an icon. (optional)
;

; This defines the progman groups that the apps above will be added to
;
; Format:
;
; "n", "Parameter String", "icon caption", "Class", "Title","filename","flags","iconfile"
;
; n		  : The number of the group, A-Z, or the name of the .exe
;		    file with path.
; parameter string: The default parameters (in a string)
; icon caption    : The string displayed below the icon.  Only needed if
;		    an external program is set up (such as winhelp).
;                   Should be empty if not an external program.
; class (OS2 ONLY): A user specified object class for objects owned by this
;                   group.  The default should be "WPProgram".
; title           : The caption on the group window
; filename	  : The name of the .GRP file.
; flags           : Can be none, one, or many of the following:
;
;                   N   :   Minimize the executeable on start. Only valid if
;                           if a name of an .exe was provided in 'n' parameter.
;                           (Only for Windows)
; iconfile        : Fully qualified path to an icon file name. It is only valid
;                   if a name of an .exe was provided in 'n' parameter. (optional)
;
; NOTE:     There are two ways for creating icons. Either by putting using 'I'
;           flag in the flags parameter of the files section or providing an exe
;           name in the 'n' paramter of the progman section. If files section was
;           used to specify the progman id then icon file name will be taken from
;           there. Otherwise, if exe name was provided in the 'n' paramter the
;           'iconfile' paramter in progman section will be used.
;

; The [ini] section defines all of the settings that will go into the app's
; .INI file.
;
; The line following the [ini] header contains the name of your .INI file.
; It should be name.extension followed by the PRODUCT IDENTIFIER.
; By default it is placed in the app's main directory.
;
; Following the Product Identifier is an optional flag 'F', which forces
; the sections to be overwritten even if they already exist (normal
; behaviour is described below).
;
; Remaining lines, to end of SETUP.ISC file, are settings for your INI file.
; All settings MUST be preceded with a group name in square brackets.
;
; If INI file does not exist, it is built with these lines verbatim.
;
; If INI file DOES exist, only new settings (right hand side) are added.
; Existing keys with different values are NOT modified in the INI file.
;
; You may substitute params into the text with %token%.  Valid tokens:
;   - single char "0", and A-Z.  Refers to token in [directories] section.
;     Note that this always substitutes a fully qualified pathname, NOT
;     terminated with a backslash.  That is, specifying a child directory
;     id token will result in: drive, colon, slash, parent, slash, child.
;
;   - "PACKAGENAME", "CAPTIONNAME", "APPNAME", "RELEASESTRING", "BASEAPP"
;       These are defined in the [setup] section.
;       Do not specify the token name within quotes.  See example.
;
; Text is substituted exactly as declared within quotes.  No blanks added.
; See example "setting6" below; see it expand when you generate INI file.

; The REGISTRY keword is available only under NT and Windows95.  This
; section replaces the INI section for these operating systems.
;
; Format:
;   Line 1:                [registry]
;   Line 2 (Group Key):    Software: A
;   Line 3..n (Keywords):  {subkey},keyword {, type, value}
;   Line n+1 (Group Key):  Environment: A
;   Line n+2..m            {subkey},keyword {, type, value}
;   Line m+1 (Group Key):  Software: B
;
; Line 2 has several options:
;       Software:    The stuff that used to go in your .ini file
;       Environment: The stuff that used to go in autoexec.bat
;   This line always contains the Product Identifier as well.
;   There can only be one software group and environment group for
;   each product.
;
; Keyword lines contain keywords with optional values to be put
; into the registry for this product.  For CASoftware, CA-Install puts this
; info in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\ComputerAssociates\{ProductName}\ and
; HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ComputerAssociates\{ProductName}\ sections
; of the Registry, where ProductName is defined in the [products] section.
;
; For Environment, these values are put in the HKEY_USERS\Environment and
; HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment sections.
;
; Subkeys can be defined, with multiple levels.  For example, to create the
; subkey Preferences\CalculationOptions you would specify
; "Preferences\\CalculationOptions","Option",REG_SZ,Value
;
; FOR THE DE-INSTALL TO WORK, YOU MUST CREATE A KEY THAT DEFINES "Root" as
;   the root directory of your application (i.e. %0%).  CA-Install will
;   also write to a file called CAREGENV.LOG which will provide de-install
;   information.
;
; All other specialized Registry installation needs will have to be handled by
; post-install processes.
;
; Types can be any one of the following values, but only 3 types are
;   fully supported (REG_SZ, REG_EXPAND_SZ, REG_NONE, and REG_DWORD - all
;   others are treated as REG_SZ for now):
;       REG_BINARY
;       REG_DWORD
;       REG_DWORD_LITTLE_ENDIAN
;       REG_DWORD_BIG_ENDIAN
;       REG_EXPAND_SZ           - A string that needs to be expanded by system
;       REG_LINK
;       REG_MULTI_SZ
;       REG_NONE
;       REG_RESOURCE_LIST
;       REG_SZ                  - Normal strings
;
; For more information on the types, see the RegQueryValueEx function
; in the Win32 SDK documentation.
