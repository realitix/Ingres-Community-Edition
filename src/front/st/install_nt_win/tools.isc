;
;  SAMPLE INSTALLATION FILE WITH FORMAT NOTES
;
;  General Rules:
;       1) Items in brackets '[' or ']' denote keywords used to define
;	   sections of the install script or used to set internal flags.
;       2) Comment lines begin with ';'
;	3) Several pre-defined variables exist:
;	    %0% : Target directory for the installed product.
;	    %1% : In WINDOWS, the Windows directory; in OS2, the
;		  current directory on the active hard disk.
;	    %2% : In WINDOWS, the Windows System directory; in OS2, the
;		  OS2 DLL directory
;	    %3% : This is a bit flag representation of up to 32
;		  components (groups) that show up on the selection
;		  dialog.  Each bit, when 1 (starting from the lowest
;		  bit) represents the respective option selected.
;		  This can be used to pass the selection information
;                 to another program when EXEC'd by the installer.
;	    %4% : This is the drive of the target directory, to pass
;                 to exec's or calls primarily.
;	    %5% : The directory of the CA-APPS common tools.  Use this
;		  as the target drive when installing common tools such
;		  as CABL.DLL, etc.
;	    %6% : The source subdirectory.
;	    %7% : The boot drive.
;	    %8% : The response file name.
;           %9% : The machine (host) name for NT and Win95
;	    %{any letter}% : The directory specified in the [directory]
;		  section that matches that letter.
;	4) MAX Disks	   = 100
;	5) MAX Files	   = 10000
;	6) MAX Directories = 625
;
;   NOTE:   If you are using help in a multi-product installation and using
;           sub-scripts then you must have instos2.hlp file on the disk.
;	    CA-Install will look on the disk and will Initialize the help
;	    manager if it finds instos2.hlp. Otherwise, it will hide the help
;	    button.
;
;   NOTE:   The new version of CA-INSTALL (3.2) is mostly backward compatible
;	    with 3.0 and old scripts should be able to run without a problem.
;	    Largest number of changes are made in the products section for
;	    multi-product installation.
;	    If you are moving from 3.0 to 3.2 the following sections are
;	    changed. Please read the full discriptions of each section,
;	    compare the changes and then update your 3.0 script files.

; to come up.
;
;[bypassui]


; The BYPASSPID flag, when present, prevents the product ID field from
; being requested and displayed when asking for user info.
;
;[bypasspid]

; The NOTCOMPLETE keyword specifies that after the install product is
; finished we don't want to display an "Install Complete" message, since
; the user will be doing more installation work via execs.
;
;[not_complete]

; The SKIPWRITEKEY  keyword skips writing the keyfile information back
; to the ORIGINAL keyfile on the source disks.	This is important for
; products that will be installed from CD-ROM or other non-writable media.
; This flag is set automatically if cd-rom key word is used.
;
[skipwritekey]

; The CD-ROM  keyword makes all the destination files writeable and

;
;[CD-ROM]


; Use the BASIC_DLG key to bring up a dialog with the basic/advanced

; The RESPONSE command specifies a filename which contains canned responses
; for the installer.  Look in the file RESPONSE.RSP for the syntax of
; response files.
;

; The SKIPCAPPS command bypasses the prompt for CA-APPS common directory.
; This should only be used if there are no common CA tools in your product,
; and you do not wish the product to be "registered" in CAI.INI.
;
[skipcaapps]

; The SKIPPLUGMSG skips the first message telling user to have a plug
; ready if the installation method requires plugs.
;

; The NOBACKLEVEL flag does not allow older versions of files to be
; installed - the user gets no indication that files have been skippped.
;
[nobacklevel]

; The USEMULTITITLE is used in multi-product installation. If it is used
; then "CA-Multiple product installation" is displayed as title on the
; product selection screen rather than the baseapp installation.
;[usemultititle]


;  The PRODUCTS keyword specifies which products are to be installed
;  for multiple product installations.	If there is only one product
;  to be installed, this keyword/section can be skipped, or it may

;  The SIGNATURE keyword checks for the existance of a file before

;
;  If there is more than one file specified a list box will display the
;  descriptions then ask the user to specify which product or file they have.
;  Once specified at least one pattern at offset 1-n must match.
;
;  If your product is compressed use the compressed offset and match
;  pattern as one pattern and the uncompressed as the other. This allows
;  the user to just insert the original disk without the need to install
;  the product. Also use multiple patterns for revisions of the product that
;  have the same file name (i.e Rev SC4 Rev A,B,C).

;                   if a name of an .exe was provided in 'n' parameter. (optional)
;
; NOTE:     There are two ways for creating icons. Either by putting using 'I'
;           flag in the flags parameter of the files section or providing an exe
;           name in the 'n' paramter of the progman section. If files section was
;           used to specify the progman id then icon file name will be taken from
;           there. Otherwise, if exe name was provided in the 'n' paramter the
;           'iconfile' paramter in progman section will be used.

; The CHANGEDIR command resets the current directory to the specified

;
; The [ini] section defines all of the settings that will go into the app's
; .INI file.
;
; The line following the [ini] header contains the name of your .INI file.
; It should be name.extension followed by the PRODUCT IDENTIFIER.
; By default it is placed in the app's main directory.
;
; Following the Product Identifier is an optional flag 'F', which forces
; the sections to be overwritten even if they already exist (normal
; behaviour is described below).
;
; Remaining lines, to end of SETUP.ISC file, are settings for your INI file.
; All settings MUST be preceded with a group name in square brackets.
;
; If INI file does not exist, it is built with these lines verbatim.
;
; If INI file DOES exist, only new settings (right hand side) are added.
; Existing keys with different values are NOT modified in the INI file.
;
; You may substitute params into the text with %token%.  Valid tokens:
;   - single char "0", and A-Z.  Refers to token in [directories] section.
;     Note that this always substitutes a fully qualified pathname, NOT
;     terminated with a backslash.  That is, specifying a child directory
;     id token will result in: drive, colon, slash, parent, slash, child.
;
;   - "PACKAGENAME", "CAPTIONNAME", "APPNAME", "RELEASESTRING", "BASEAPP"
;       These are defined in the [setup] section.
;       Do not specify the token name within quotes.  See example.
;
; Text is substituted exactly as declared within quotes.  No blanks added.
; See example "setting6" below; see it expand when you generate INI file.

; The REGISTRY keword is available only under NT and Windows95.  This
; section replaces the INI section for these operating systems.
;
; Format:
;   Line 1:                [registry]
;   Line 2 (Group Key):    Software: A
;   Line 3..n (Keywords):  {subkey},keyword {, type, value}
;   Line n+1 (Group Key):  Environment: A
;   Line n+2..m            {subkey},keyword {, type, value}
;   Line m+1 (Group Key):  Software: B
;
; Line 2 has several options:
;       Software:    The stuff that used to go in your .ini file
;       Environment: The stuff that used to go in autoexec.bat
;   This line always contains the Product Identifier as well.
;   There can only be one software group and environment group for
;   each product.
;
; Keyword lines contain keywords with optional values to be put
; into the registry for this product.  For CASoftware, CA-Install puts this
; info in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\ComputerAssociates\{ProductName}\ and
; HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ComputerAssociates\{ProductName}\ sections
; of the Registry, where ProductName is defined in the [products] section.
;
; For Environment, these values are put in the HKEY_USERS\Environment and
; HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment sections.
;
; Subkeys can be defined, with multiple levels.  For example, to create the
; subkey Preferences\CalculationOptions you would specify
; "Preferences\\CalculationOptions","Option",REG_SZ,Value
;
; FOR THE DE-INSTALL TO WORK, YOU MUST CREATE A KEY THAT DEFINES "Root" as
;   the root directory of your application (i.e. %0%).  CA-Install will
;   also write to a file called CAREGENV.LOG which will provide de-install
;   information.
;
; All other specialized Registry installation needs will have to be handled by
; post-install processes.
;
; Types can be any one of the following values, but only 3 types are
;   fully supported (REG_SZ, REG_EXPAND_SZ, REG_NONE, and REG_DWORD - all
;   others are treated as REG_SZ for now):
;       REG_BINARY
;       REG_DWORD
;       REG_DWORD_LITTLE_ENDIAN
;       REG_DWORD_BIG_ENDIAN
;       REG_EXPAND_SZ           - A string that needs to be expanded by system
;       REG_LINK
;       REG_MULTI_SZ
;       REG_NONE
;       REG_RESOURCE_LIST
;       REG_SZ                  - Normal strings
;
; For more information on the types, see the RegQueryValueEx function
; in the Win32 SDK documentation.
