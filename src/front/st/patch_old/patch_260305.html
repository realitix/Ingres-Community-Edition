<P>
Providing the patch was installed with the 'Backup.....' option checked the 
patch may be uninstalled using the following procedure:<ol>
  <li>Start the Windows Explorer.</li>
  <li>Locate the directory used as the backup during patch installation, e.g. %II_SYSTEM%\ingres\install\backup.</li>
  <li>Click and hold on the Ingres directory, e.g. %II_SYSTEM%\ingres\install\backup\pre-pNNNN\ingres 
  where NNNN is the patch number.</li>
  <li>Drag this directory to the %II_SYSTEM% directory and release.</li>
  </ol>
<P>
Answer 'Yes to all' when prompted.<br>
<br>
This sequence of steps moves the backup files back into the %II_SYSTEM% 
directory structure and overwrites those files that are already present.<br>
<br>
If you have multiple backup directories from multiple patch installations care 
should be taken when deciding which directory to use. For example, if patch 1 
was installed, and then later patch 2 was installed, uninstalling using the 
patch 1 backup will cause both patch 1 and 2 to be uninstalled.<br>

reference, each problem is listed with its published STARTRAK problem identifier, and the 
operating systems to which it applies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please note, that in 
contrast to patches supplied for SP1 and before, problems are labelled with the

TID joins currently process the rows in whatever sequence
the TIDs arrive from the subplan below. In most cases, this
sequence bears no relationship to the physical order of the
rows in the target table. For Tjoins on large numbers of rows,
this means the rows are read randomly and the join may
perform up to one disk read for each. This SIR proposes to
presort the TID list into TID sequence to reduce the amount of
disk access required for a Tjoin.

Display of session ID values in IMA tables is inconsistent with Ingres
utilities which display session identifiers, in that IMA will display the
value as a decimal number, while ipm, and iimonitor will display this in
hexadecimal. The normal work around of converting the returned value to
an integer, and then displaying the integer's hex value (E.g. SELECT
HEX(INT4(session_id))) FROM ima_server_sessions) does not work on 64 bit
platforms since the session ID will overflow a four byte integer.
<br>
<br>
A new configuration parameter (hex_session_ids) has been provided to allow
columns in IMA tables which contain session identifiers to return these
values using hexadecimal notation.  Columns effected by this parameter are:
<br>
<br>
System Component        Table Name                      Column Name
DBMS Server             ima_server_sessions             session_ptr
DBMS Server             ima_server_sessions             session_id
DBMS Server             ima_server_sessions_desc        session_id
DBMS Server             ima_server_sessions_extra       session_id

DBMS Server             ima_log_processes               force_abort_session
DBMS Server             ima_log_processes               group_commit_session

ICE Server              ice_user_transactions           trn_session
<br>
<br>
This parameter may be added to your config.dat by executing "iigenres
`iipmhost`".   Value for this parameter can then changed using cbf or
vcbf with the configure option for the listed System Component.

(GENERIC)
The execution of a row_producing procedure that returns enough rows
to require more than one GCA_TUPLE (pre-fetch) buffer will incorrectly
leave a positive lock count in the QSF object descriptor for the cached
query plan. This causes the query plan to become "stuck" in QSF.

occurrence is dependent on unknown environmental factors.
<h3>INGSRV2273 (Linux)</h3>
<p>On Linux IPCCLEAN does not catch both versions of
'resource deleted' from IPCRM.
<h3>INGSRV2277 (Generic)</h3>
<p>SQL commands contained with environment variables
ING_SET, ING_SYSTEM_SET, or ING_SET_DBNAME will be executed
using applications privileges when that application is run.
Behavior has been changed to ignore DROP, CREATE, DELETE,
UPDATE, INSERT, MODIFY, or SELECT commands and to issue a
warning.
<h3><a name="INGSRV2279">INGSRV2279</a> (ATTENTION, Generic)</h3>
<p>Hash joins are well known to be an alternative to sort
merge join, and have been implemented in 2.6, but since
Service Pack 1 (SP1) have been disabled by default.&nbsp;A
hash join algorithm should perform at least as well as an
equivalent sort merge or partial sort merge join, and
usually much better, and the change associated with this
SIR enables Hash Joins by default.&nbsp;However, in certain
cases, the performance of certain queries has been seen to
suffer.&nbsp;If this is the case, the global default for
this feature may be set to off by adding
"<b style="font-weight: bold">ii.</b><i style="font-style: italic">machinename</i><b style="font-weight: bold">.dbms.*.opf_hash_join:
off</b>" to
<b style="font-weight: bold">$II_SYSTEM/ingres/files/config.dat</b>.&nbsp;Control of
this at the session level may be managed with TRACE POINT
OP162.&nbsp;Setting this trace point sets the activation
state for this feature opposite to the value set in
<b style="font-weight: bold">config.dat</b>,&nbsp;clearing the trace point restores
the feature activation state to the global default.
<h3>INGSRV2280 (UNIX)</h3>
<p>The DBMS server crashes when inserting 46 characters
into a LONG BYTE column when the page_size is 8K and the
stack_size is the default (65536).
<h3>INGSRV2281 (Generic)</h3>
<p>The transform of "not exists" to outer joins is too
restrictive, even when a simple restriction predicate is
ANDed to a correlation predicate. The transform is not
applied in other cases when it should. Specifically, if the
where clause contains other restriction predicates, the
flattening potential is sometimes missed.
<h3>INGSRV2282 (Generic)</h3>
<p>Poor memory management in the parameter manager facility
may cause a gradual increase in the virtual memory size of
the DBMS server process.
<h3>INGSRV2283 (Windows)</h3>
<p>The Advantage Ingres Service does not register for the
shutdown event. It also does not shutdown Ingres when there
are active sessions spawned from another service.
<h3>INGSRV2287 (Generic)</h3>
<p>New releases of Ingres that introduced additional
reserved words inevitably result in syntax errors in
applications written long before that use one of the
reserved words as an entity name (table, column, etc.). The
request is to make Ingres parsers treat reserved words in a
context sensitive manner so they only cause errors when
used in an ambiguous context.
<h3>INGSRV2289 (Generic)</h3>
<p>Right outer hash joins may produce extraneous result
rows.
<h3>INGSRV2290 (Generic)</h3>
<p>If a hash join is performed in which the join columns
are VARCHAR or TEXT type and one or more of the columns has
trailing blanks though a matching value does not (or the
number of trailing blanks is different), pairs of matching
rows may not be found. Change to trim only for VARCHAR (and
NVARCHAR). Trailing blanks are significant for TEXT.
<h3>INGSRV2292 (Generic)</h3>
<p>A hash outer join generating enough rows in the outer
source of the join to overflow onto disk can omit some of
the non-joined rows from the outer join.
<h3>INGSRV2293 (Generic)</h3>
<p>The SET [NO]OPTIMIZEONLY statement currently requires
the executing user to have tracepoint authorization. This
is not consistent with other OPF set statements (e.g. SET
[NO]QEP) that do NOT require tracepoint authorization.
<h3>INGSRV2295 (Generic)</h3>
<p>A view was created that selects a case expression from
the result of an outer join. When a query is issued on the
view with a where clause restriction on the case
expression, the wrong number of rows may be returned. The
same problem may occur without views, when a case
expression is used in the where clause of an outer join
query, and a column referenced in the case expression comes
from the inner side of the outer join.
<h3>INGSRV2296 (Generic)</h3>
<p>Repeat queries run in a tight loop in a highly
concurrent environment with other instances of the query
may very occasionally return incorrect results.
<h3>INGSRV2297 (Generic)</h3>
<p>A hash join between 2 sources, one of which has a row
size in excess of 8K can cause an exception (SIGSEGV).
<h3>INGSRV2299 (Generic)</h3>
<p>Some complex queries may get OP0889 errors. The queries
observed so far with this problem are big enough to be
compiled with the new enumeration heuristic and contain 2
or more subselects OR'ed together in the where clause.
<h3>INGSRV2300 (Generic)</h3>
<p>A join between a TEXT column and a VARCHAR column
returns fewer rows than expected. The problem could occur
joining a TEXT column to other data types, too (including
another TEXT column), and could also occur in an
aggregation query in which one of the grouping columns is
TEXT.
<h3>INGSRV2304 (Generic)</h3>
<p>Incorrect results may be produced by complex queries
with numerous nested joins in which a FSM join is placed
above a hash join.
<h3>INGSRV2305 (Generic)</h3>
<p>A hash join or aggregation using columns of C data type
may produce incorrect results. Hash join/aggregates on
Unicode columns or CHAR/VARCHAR columns with alternate
collation may also produce incorrect results.
<h3>INGSRV2306 (Generic)</h3>
<p>An outer join query in which the inner table of the
outer join is a view that itself contains an outer join
will generate an E_OP0395 error (unexpected outer join ID
found).
<h3>INGSRV2307 (Generic)</h3>
<p>An aggregate query in which a grouping column also
appears in an equijoin predicate in which the other column
is not exactly the same type (the columns were i2 and i4 in
the problem script) may produce apparent garbage for the
grouping column.
<h3>INGSRV2310 (Generic)</h3>
<p>A select in a for-loop in a procedure in which an order
by clause contains the same column more than once, and that
column does NOT appear in the select-list, will cause an
exception (SIGSEGV) in QEF. A SEGV may also happen when an
"order by" in a database procedure select statement
references a column not in the select list (or redefined by
"AS" clause).
<h3>INGSRV2312 (Generic)</h3>
<p>XA global transaction may be rolled back if first
updating statement of any participating transaction aborts,
possibly resulting in lost updates.
<h3>INGSRV2313 (Generic)</h3>
<p>Error message E_US1594 incorrectly reports table name
and composite key length when one of the columns is greater
than the maximum btree key length.
<h3>INGSRV2314 (Generic)</h3>
<p>The DBMS error handling for the ENABLE SECURITY_AUDIT
statement has been fixed.
<h3>INGSRV2315 (Generic)</h3>
<p>There are various problems with parallel sort
synchronization and sort work file usage, leading to
SRopen() errors, un-initialized semaphore errors,
exceptions (SIGSEGV), and/or stuck parent/child threads.
<h3>INGSRV2316 (Generic)</h3>
<p>The E_DMA464_LGREAD_BADFORMAT error is reported by the
Archiver.
<h3>INGSRV2317 (Generic)</h3>
<p>When running Ingres with Tuxedo, the following errors
may be seen in the tuxedo log: "ERROR: Service xa_start
returned XAER_RMERR, ERROR: Service xa_start returned
XAER_PROTO". These errors will no longer occur. NOTE that
the number of transaction entries allocated per application
server in the Ingres-Tuxedo shared memory segment used to
be II_TUX_XN_MAX/II_XA_SESSION_CACHE_LIMIT but it is now
II_TUX_XN_MAX/II_TUX_AS_MAX which allows tuxedo users to
lower II_XA_SESSION_CACHE_LIMIT and increase the number of
transaction entries allocated per application server.
<h3>INGSRV2318 (Generic)</h3>
<p>An exception could occur in LG_abort_transaction()
trying to abort an XA transaction after a log full
condition.
<h3>INGSRV2319 (Generic)</h3>
<p>AUDITDB reports E_DM1206_ATP_TOO_MANY_TX and
E_DM1205_ATP_NO_BT_FOUND errors when the -b and/or -e
options (timestamp constraints) are used.
<h3><a name="INGSRV2320">INGSRV2320</a> (ATTENTION, Generic)</h3>
<p>Tuxedo server may crash or get the following error
during shutdown: "E_CX0003 Unable to free memory: cl_status
= 70155 for control block = cx_cb_p". The application and
TMS servers need to be re-linked after applying this patch.
<h3>INGSRV2321 (Generic)</h3>
<p>Updating a VARCHAR column with a greater than 2K string
in a database created with a custom collation sequence
causes the DBMS server to crash silently with no error
reported in the errlog.log.
<h3>INGSRV2322 (Generic)</h3>
<p>Using Tuxedo for distributed transaction management, the
following errors are reported in errlog.log:
E_DM904A_FATAL_EXCEPTION, preceded by other errors
indicating failure to PREPARE/SECURE or failure to ROLLBACK
a distributed transaction. The errors can occur if a Tuxedo
TMS server sends a rollback for a transaction while another
Tuxedo TMS server is preparing the same transaction. Other
errors might include: E_DMA406_LG_WRITE_BAD_STAT,
E_DM9370_DM0L_SECURE, E_DM9505_DMXE_WILLING_COMMIT,
E_DM9503_DMXE_ABORT.
<h3>INGSRV2323 (Generic)</h3>
<p>E_DM9049_UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION is generated in the DBMS
server (and then the RCP server) In the errlog.log you will
also see the following stack dump: aduucmp, adt_kkcmp,
dmv_compare_key, dmve_bid_check, dmve_btput The errors
happen during REDO or UNDO (rollback) of an update to a
btree table with NCHAR/NVARCHAR data, where the
NCHAR/NVARCHAR column is part of the btree key.
<h3>INGSRV2324 (UNIX)</h3>
<p>The 'Move Log to Journals' button in IJA UNIX fails with
"E_US1A22 Database name starting with ' ' contains invalid
characters".
<h3>INGSRV2325 (Generic)</h3>
<p>Upgrading a 32-bit database to Ingres 2.6 64-bit using
UPGRADEDB succeeds, but then an insert/update of a table
upgraded fails with E_RD0132_QUERY_TREE,
E_PS0D15_RDF_GETINFO. The problem happens if the table has
a check constraint, e.g. "CREATE TABLE T (col1 INT NOT
NULL, CONSTRAINT ccc CHECK (col1 &gt; 0))". During
UPGRADEDB the check constraint which has a stored query
tree should have been dropped and recreated, but it wasn't.
<h3>INGSRV2326 (Windows client, HP-UX server)</h3>
<p>IIACCT ACCOUNTING: On a client(Windows)/server(HP-UX)
instance, the accounting reports produced by iiacct +
convacct + acctcom -h show all the activity belonging to
the user "ingres" even when this activity belongs to other
users.
<h3>INGSRV2327 (UNIX)</h3>
<p>The archiver ACPEXIT script in
<i style="font-style: italic">$II_SYSTEM/ingres/files</i> is not called if you kill
the DMFACP process or if you execute "ingstop &#150;dmfacp".
<h3>INGSRV2328 (UNIX)</h3>
<p>When performing an "insert as select" against a STAR
database, where the source table is in a remote database
being accessed through a VNODE, the GCC server will hang if
the OS IPC buffer subsystem becomes full.
<h3>INGSRV2329 (Generic)</h3>
<p>The INGSTART utility now prints out a GCC's port
information when starting up a GCC. It also waits for a GCC
to accept connections before continuing on.
<h3>INGSRV2330 (Generic)</h3>
<p>"copydb -with_proc -add_drop ..." may add more than one
drop procedure statement for each procedure.
<h3>INGSRV2331 (Generic)</h3>
<p>USERMOD fails when executed with II_TEMPORARY set to an
embedded spaced location with "E_US1A22 Database name
starting with 'files\' contains invalid characters".
<h3>INGSRV2332 (UNIX)</h3>
<p>MKRAWLOG fails with message "Symbol II_LOG_FILE_NAME
must be defined" on hosts with fully qualified hostnames
(i.e., machinename.domain).
<h3>INGSRV2333 (Windows)</h3>
<p>A database could become inconsistent through a COPY IN
of variable length data (i.e., varchar) which fails (i.e.,
due to a bad data file).
<h3>INGSRV2334 (HP-UX)</h3>
<p>VDBA fails to properly create HTTP type ICE locations
when using 64-bit Ingres as the server.
<h3>INGSRV2335 (Solaris)</h3>
<p>SYSCHECK may fail on a release of an operating system if
it is newer than the one Ingres was compiled on.
<h3>INGSRV2336 (Generic)</h3>
<p>The Replicator service internally gets an exception
(SIGSEGV) with a stack overflow. This causes the Replicator
server to not shut down properly unless a reboot is
performed. This happens when a two-phase commit is in
progress and it fails.
<h3>INGSRV2337 (Generic)</h3>
<p>Queries containing decimal to integer comparisons fail
withE_OP0791_ADE_INSTRGEN and E_AD200B, e.g.:
<p>create table foo (deccol decimal(9,0), intcol integer);
<p>select * from foo where deccol = 1;
<p>select * from foo where deccol = intcol
<h3>INGSRV2339 (Generic)</h3>
<p>The CACHEUTIL banner text is now displayed properly.
<h3>INGSRV2340 (Windows)</h3>
<p>The LIST output from CACHEUTIL now does not wrap around
by one character.
<h3>INGSRV2341 (HP-UX)</h3>
<p>Performance enhancements have been made to OS threading
in Ingres on HP-UX.
<h3>INGSRV2342 (Solaris)</h3>
<p>CS_su4_dump_stack() does not print the PC addresses at
which functions are called if the function name is found.
<h3>INGSRV2343 (Generic)</h3>
<p>The cache_lock help description in CBF under DBMS is
incorrect. It should read: "The cache_lock status
determines whether or not the cache pages will be locked
into physical memory. This will help to avoid swap file
paging. Attempts to lock more cache into memory than a
system-specific limit will fail. Because of the impact on
system resources, the use of cache locking is restricted to
the super-user."
<h3>INGSRV2344 (Generic)</h3>
<p>SYSCHECK incorrectly reports the number and size of
shared memory segments required when dmf_separate is on.
<h3>INGSRV2355 (Linux)</h3>
<p>Optimization of complex query takes a very long time
when the system is running under load (Linux OS threading).
<h3>INGSRV2364 (Generic)</h3>
<p>Seemingly simple query ignores obvious secondary index,
choosing to do much more expensive table scan.
<h3>INGSRV2365 (Generic)</h3>
<p>The user environment variable II_CKTMPL_FILE can be use
to set the location of the checkpoint template file.
<h3>INGSRV2369 (64-Bit)</h3>
<p>The 64-bit versions of Advantage Ingres did not allow
allocation of more that 2GB of memory for the DMF buffer
manager.
<h3>INGSRV2370 (Generic)</h3>
<p>Sporadic occurrences of exceptions (SIGSEGV or SIGBUS)
are seen within the OPF facility. This is seen on busy
systems with queries that perform joins on columns with
histograms.
<h3>INGSRV2371 (AIX)</h3>
<p>While running OPTIMIZEDB, the client received an error
"iiCLfdreg FATAL: fd 8535 surpasses max fd 8192" and the
DBMS server then hung.
<h3>INGSRV2377 (Generic)</h3>
<p>The USERMOD utility does not display the usage message
when the input string is just a '-' character.
<h3>INGSTR47 (UNIX)</h3>
<p>Errors in STARVIEW are generated when a failure occurred
during a select of the SQL and TESTNODE.
