                                                       17-July-2000
			   Ingres Patch Notes 

			II 2.0/9808 (int.wnt/00)

			      Patch ID m1050



				  NOTES 
				  -----

	a) This document assumes the Ingres 2.0/9808 (int.wnt/00)
	   product has been fully installed before this patch is
	   subsequently installed.

	b) Please read the complete document before installing
	   this patch.

	c) Ensure you are running with minimum patch LO80296 
	   for LicenseIT.  This particular patch can be found
	   in the ftp://ftp.ca.com/pub/License98/lo80296 directory.

	To install this patch
	---------------------

	Perform the following patch procedure for your Ingres
	installation. The patch is supplied on one cd.

	1. Insert the CD if you have one.

	2. If you have downloaded the patch from our WEB site or if the CD you
	   received contains a ZIP file, then you should first unZIP the ZIP file
	   to a temporary directory on a hard drive.

	3. Type the following commands at a command prompt:

	   cd <drive containing unzipped version of the patch>
           install

	4. Follow the instructions displayed on the screen to complete
	   the patch installation.

	During installation the following options are available :-
	1. 'Force execution of patch install even if cdimage verification fails'
	   This option forces the patch to be installed despite the verification
	   of the files to be installed failing. This option should only be used
	   on the advice of CA technical support.

	2. 'Backup files to be replaced in the installation'
           Any files that will be replaced during the installation of this patch
	   will be backed up to a specified directory. The default directory is
	   II_SYSTEM\ingres\install\backup
	   It is recommended that this option be chosen as it allows the patch 
	   to be uninstalled should that prove necessary.

	3. 'Install Patch'
	   Clicking this button will install the patch

	4. 'View Patch Notes'
	   Clicking this button allows you to view the patch notes for this patch
	   release

	5. 'Exit Installation'
	   Clicking this button will terminate the patch installation without
	   installing the patch

	
	
	To UnInstall this patch
	-----------------------

	Providing the patch was installed with the 'Backup.....' option checked 
	you can uninstall the patch by using the following procedure.

	1. Start the WindowsNT Explorer

	2. Locate the directory used as the backup during patch installation
	   e.g. %II_SYSTEM%\ingres\install\backup

	3. Click and hold on the Ingres directory
	   e.g. %II_SYSTEM\ingres\install\backup\pre-pNNNN\ingres
	   where NNNN is the patch number

	4. Drag this directory to the II_SYSTEM directory and release

	5. Answer 'Yes to all' when prompted.
	 
	This sequence of steps moves the backup files back into the II_SYSTEM directory
	structure and overwrites those files that are already present.
	
	If you have multiple backup directories from multiple patch installations care
	should be taken when deciding which directory to use. For example, if you installed
	patch 1 and then installed a later patch, patch 2, but decided to uninstall 
	using the patch 1 backup then this will cause both patch 1 and 2 to be uninstalled.

	If you have any doubts please contact your local CA Technical Support.


			Problems Solved in Patch m1030
			-----------------------------


		      Problems Solved in Previous Patches
		      -----------------------------------

	(GENERIC)
	optimizedb -zs100.0 is rejected with error E_OP094E '-zs' flag
	must be followed by a number in the (0.0, 100.0) range expressing
	percentage of table rows to be sampled.
	(38890)


	(GENERIC)
	Copying into a table which is being accessed by a session
	with readlock set to nolock may get a "table access conflict"
	message.
	(39343)


	Rollforwarddb aborts when it is used against a multi-location
	database in which two locations point to the same physical area.
	(39563)


	(GENERIC)
	Embedded SQL statement names used in PREPARE and DESCRIBE for example, can now be set to 32
	characters without resulting in error E_US0900.
	(43805)


	(GENERIC)
	Rollforwarddb will not apply valid journals after alterdb has been 
	used to set nojournaling on a database, even when the #f flag is
	used, as recommended in the reported message E_DM93A0
	(44250)


	Shadow password validation fails if the password contains more 
	than eight characters, because some Unix platforms append "noise" 
	characters to the entries in the password file.
	(44829)


	Shadow password validation fails if the password contains more 
	than eight characters, because some Unix platforms append "noise" 
	characters to the entries in the password file.
	(44829)
 

	AUDITDB: logical_key column updates print in binary. That is,
	when auditing an Update/Replace of a logical key it prints as
	binary control characters rather than \XXX or Hex. This makes
	using the audit trail awkward.
	(45752)


	(GENERIC)
	Using the "newrow" command, <CTRL>N, in a READONLY tablefield that
	has an invisible first column, will cause the application to abort.
	(48278)


	(GENERIC)
	The following errors can occur after SYSMOD of a core catalog:
	(iirelation, iiattribute, iindexes)
	E_DM9335_DM2F_ENDFILE, E_DM920D_BAD_GROUP_FAULTPAGE errors in errlog.
	(52131)


	(GENERIC)
	The DBMS server locks up with one session in LOCK_WAIT, another
	in DIO_WAIT, and a third in CS_MUTEX.  
	(55788)


	(GENERIC)
	The following errors can occur after SYSMOD of a core catalog:
	(iirelation, iiattribute, iindexes)
	E_DM9335_DM2F_ENDFILE, E_DM920D_BAD_GROUP_FAULTPAGE errors in errlog.
	(57674)


	During an escalation to a table lock (thus generating
	E_DM9041_LK_ESCALATE_TABLE), the DBMS server may not release
	all the page level locks on the table. This has been
	corrected.
	(63389)


	(Generic)
	Online checkpoint can stall with undetectable deadlock between LK and LG. Fixed.
	(67888)


	Numeric format field templates which contain spaces in them will now
	function correctly.  When the user types data into a field, and the
	data conforms to the template, the data will be accepted and no error
	message will be displayed.
	(68819)


	REPLICATOR: When vertical partitioning is setup, even if a
	non replicated column is updated, replicator performs
	data capture, creates shadow and archive table records, etc.
	This is not necessary and leads to performance overhead.
	(69562)


	(GENERIC)
	While there is another session connected to database, aborting
	a two phase commit transaction via lartool, results in the
	transaction being committed instead of being aborted.
	(72386)


	SQL: SELECT on table with ORDER BY can fail
	with "E_DM9713  Error occurred writing to sort work file",
	even though multiple work locations are available
	with enough space for sort.
	(75831)


	(GENERIC)
	Fortran pre-compiler (eqf) now allows Fortran union/structure declarations.
	(76361)


	Added the "\nomacro" command to the end of the iiud* quel scripts
	supplied in the $II_SYSTEM/ingres/files directory. This terminate
	quel-style processing of escape characters, and allows the
	quel scripts to be safely included in sql scripts that reference
	their own escape characters.
	(76403)


	(Generic)
	Possible Segmentation Violation during rollforwarddb when
	applying log records for multi-location btree tables.
	(76729)


	(Generic)
	Recovery of a BTREE association record when the
	relation resides on multiple locations could fail.
	Application of log records during rollback or rollforward 
	could fail for multi-location btree tables. This could 
	potentially crash the database with a failed pass abort, 
	cause database to be marked inconsistent on startup, and/or 
	prevent a successful rollforwarddb when applying journals.
	Also bug 76729
	(76748)


	The IPM session detail display showed "Performing Force Abort
	Processing" as "Activity" for sessions that were executing normal
	rollback.
	(77435)


	(GENERIC)
	The following errors can occur after SYSMOD of a core catalog:
	(iirelation, iiattribute, iindexes)
	E_DM93A7_BAD_FILE_PAGE_ADDR, E_DM9206_BM_BAD_PAGE_ADDR
	OR
	E_DM9335_DM2F_ENDFILE, E_DM920D_BAD_GROUP_FAULTPAGE errors in errlog.
	(78889)


	The FASTLOAD utility will properly work with complex User Defined
	Datatypes. Remember that if a new UDT is created, it should have a
	defined length function.
	(79167)


	If a single session executes many repeated update queries, a QEF
	memory leak will surface. In the errlog.log, there will be a constant
	display of errors E_UL0005_NOMEM and E_QE000D_NO_MEMORY_LEFT.
	Sessions will find it hard to connect to the DBMS server (if it can
	be done at all).
	(79195)


	The bug script involves an SQL script which declares Global
	Temporary Tables with long varchar/byte columns, inserts into those
	tables via INSERT statements and procedures, and then drops the
	temporary tables (with autocommit turned on). After running the
	script in one session multiple times, the SQL session eventually
	hangs. In the errlog.log, there are errors E_DM0010_BAD_DB_ID,
	E_DM002A_BAD_PARAMETER, E_PS0D20_QEF_ERROR, E_SC0215_PSF_ERROR,
	E_PS0007_INT_OTHER_FAC_ERROR, and E_SC0206_CANNOT_PROCESS.
	(79203)


	(GENERIC)
	QBF: Issuing 'qbf <dbname> -l <querytarget>' will not find joindefs
	or qbfnames called <querytarget>. Error - "No QBFName, JoinDef or
	Table name '<querytarget>' exists or is owned by you. (E_QF0120)".
	(79348)


	(NT ONLY)
	iigcc.exe crashes with pop-up message "iigcc.exe - application error".
	(79609)


	QBF: Appends garbage when column is defined as "with null with
	default null". If the column is integer it appends 0 or somtimes
	the value of the previous row instead of the default. If the 
	field is varchar it appends allways the string NULL.
	This has now been corrected.
	(79618)


	Ingres servers would run out of memory when handling request againts 
	many tables (a few thousand).  This has been resolved by re-using 
	resources when a certain number of tables have been opened. 
	(80050)


	(GENERIC)
	The following error is reported when a cursor attempts to delete a row after
	updating a row:
	Generic sql error=34000, E_US08A3 Cursor 'xx' does not have delete permission
	Problem only occurs when there are more than 19 permissions against a table.
	(80064)


	(GENERIC)
	When copying a table which has a column of data type long polygon,
	the output file grows in size until it fills up the disk, at which
	point it fails.
	(80955)


	"insert into table_a(col1, col2) select col3, long_polygon(col4)
	from table_b" generates error E_DM005D_TABLE_ACCESS_CONFLICT in 
	errlog.log, even though the transaction is successful. Note that
	col4 in table_b is a blob column.
	(80957)


	(GENERIC)
	In ACCESSDB create a user with permissions security and
	maintain_users. Then as that user you then you try to
	edit users in accessdb (change permissions and or group).
	This results in E_US18D5 you do not have privileges to issue
	form of ALTER USER/PROFILE statement.
	(81618)


	A query of the form 'select ifnull(tab1.col1, -2), count(tab2.col2)
	from ((tab1 join tab2 on ... ) left join (tab2 on ...) will produce
	spurious values in the ifnull() result column for non-null
	values. The usual result is 256. Null values will be handled
	correctly by ifnull().
	(82496)


	Optimizing exist clauses with compound aggregates 
	will no longer generate E_OP0901_UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION
	and E_OP08A2 Unexpected exception occurred within 
	query compilation
	(83929)


	(GENERIC)
	In a shared cache, fast commit environment bursts of the following
	errors are reported to the errlog.log;
	E_DM0054, E_DM9C84, E_DM9C81
	(83999)


	Using VISION, a decimal value of 0.0484 displayed with a format
	of f6.3 showed 0.484 as the result.
	(84158)


	Re-inserting or updating of a record in a replicated table, which caused the
	replication key to be set to a previously used value (which no longer existed)
	could cause there to be multiple qaulifying un-archived shadow table records.
	This could result in error 1556 -- D_DELETE in the replication server
	log. This will no longer happen.
	(85136)


	QUERY: Join on 2 or more tables where QEP is FSM join
	can fail with E_QE000D "QEF is out of memory",plus
	E_UL0005 if query is executed in DBMS with CBF default 
	settings for qef_sort_mem.
	(85267)


	When ABF uses the command "imageapp <dbname> <application name>
	-constants_file='<filename>', varchar constants defined in the file
	are truncated to the size of the constant's value initialized on
	the ABF scripts. This problem occurs when the ABF application is
	developed in OpenIngres 1.2/01. This fix overrides the constant's
	value initialised on the ABF script with the varchar constant's
	string defined in the file.
	(86115)


	Rollforwarddb:  The addition of 2 environment variables (logicals)
	to give more details on the progress of journal application.
	
	Currently, a message is displayed for every 100 transactions
	applied. However, in the case of transactions containing huge
	amounts of journal records, the user might have the feeling that
	Rollforwarddb is not progressing, since there has been no output
	for a long time.
	
	The 2 environment variables/logicals to be checked for are:
	
		II_RFP_JNL_RECORD_INTERVAL n
	
	where n is a numeric value typically in a multiple of 1000.
	This logical, if set, will cause a date/time stamp message with the
	number of records processed in the current journal file to be output
	every 'n' records. If not set, no output will be generated.
	
		II_RFP_JNL_BYTE_INTERVAL n
	
	where n is a numeric value typically in a multiple of 10000.
	This logical, if set, will cause a date/time stamp message with the
	number of bytes processed in the current journal file to be output
	every approximately 'n' bytes. The total number of bytes for the
	journal file displayed may be less than the actual physical size of
	the file due to blocking factors. If not set, no output will be
	generated.
	
	If journal processing is to be monitored, you can set either or both
	of these values. These need to be set prior to starting the
	Rollforwarddb process.
	(86486)


	Performing a Distributed Select Query that contains the
	NOT EXISTS clause causes error codes 2716 and E_RQ0042
	to be reported and the query fails.
	(87493)


	The test case involves creating a database, checkpointing the
	database, and then extending the database to a location which is
	in the same physical location as ii_database. Rollforwarding the
	database will fail with E_DM130D and E_DM1301.
	(87552)


	(Generic)
	When a user other than "ingres" tries to create a location in accessdb, no error is reported and the 
	location will be created successfully even though the location path does not exist. 
	(87619)


	Changed the misleading message text for the error E_QE0236.
	(87839)


	An exception caused by selecting limit values for float and real 
	types now displays the correct value.
	(88843)


	For tables greater than 1 gig, a variety of errors may be
	seen when running verifydb in report mode. These errors
	on btree and isam tables are bogus since the table does not
	actually seem to have any corruption. As evidenced by the
	fact that they can be modified to other structure types
	without error.
	(88922)


	Performing a select on a decimal datatype in an ABF application
	would generate a Decimal Overflow error. This has been corrected.
	(88975)


	The IPM "Session Detail" screen shows corrupted information during
	the DBMS recovery of a session.  This has been corrected.
	(89176)


	Added VDBA support.
	(89252)


	When a SEGV occurs in a Unix server, the information placed in 
	the errlog.log is minimal and does not provide a useful stack dump.
	(89582)


	(Generic)
	E_DU3004 NO_ALIAS_FLAG You are not authorised to use the alias flag, '-u'
	is reported when a user other than INGRES tries to create a database in
	an SQL-92 installation. The user has the 'Create Database' permission.
	(89657)


	Since the fix to bug 82496 - ABF applications using
	the ifnull() function have (on certain platforms)
	experienced data corruption within the application.
	(89868)


	When using "EXEC SQL CALL ISQL (database ='dbname')", the ISQL
	session is not started.
	(90022)


	When running rollforwarddb dbname -table=<table> and <table>
	does not exist in the checkpoint, an IX lock will remain in
	place on the dbname's journal file. This lock may be escalated
	to an X lock and cause subsequent rollforwards to wait. This 
	situation has been corrected.
	(90140)


	The ABF compiler will fail if a 4GL procedure call is in lowercase
	and the procedure declaration is in uppercase. The error is
	"Undefended Symbol .... when trying to image.". This is also a
	problem when using CALLPROC.
	(90148)


	Multiple executions of a prepared statement in which a view is
	used (and the user does not have base table access) fails with
	"E_US0DAE SELECT on table: no GRANT or GRANT compatible permit
	exists" on each successive execution after the first.
	(90168)


	Added support for 'for read only' cursor loops and set cursor
 	rows <count>.
	(90302)


	Errors E_CL1039, E_CL1003 followed by SIGSEGV. Only able
	to reliably reproduce in a clustered ingres environment in
	which one of the clustered nodes is a dual (or better)
	processor machine. The erros indicate a bad param
	in LKrelease. Potentially seen in any environment
	especially those running on dual or multi CPU machines.
	(90388)


	(GENERIC)
	On transaction abort, resulting from removing the session via
	ipm, the errors reported to the errlog.log are incorrect. The
	errors reported are E_DM010C, E_QE0024 and E_DM9059. These errors
	indicate that the abort is being performed due to a logfile 
	full situation which is not the case.
	(90402)


	If, while initializing a new session, the front-end application
	terminates the connection to the DBMS server, a ULE_FORMAT error 0
	can be generated in the errlog.log . Approximately 10 seconds later
	the DBMS server could ACCVIO.
	(90634)


	(GENERIC)
	The optimizer does not make use of the index structure
	on a secondary index when it would be more efficient
	to do so for a query containing a 'not in' predicate.
	(90889)


	The optimizedb utility hangs and SEGV's when it is executed with
	the -zx (minmax stats) option against a table with a char(3)
	hash key.
	(90917)


	(GENERIC)
	iiexport <dbname>/star <appname> -record=<name> -intfile=<filename>
	fails with the following error messages :-
	E_US0846 Invalid qualifier 't1'. 't1' must be declared in the FROM
	clause or equivalent. If used in a target list, 't1' must be declared
	at the current scope.
	E_SC021E Specified cursor is not known to the server.
	(90928)


	(NT ONLY)
	Memory leak in the DBMS or server-side GCC may occur when a client 
	disconnects.
	(90952)


	Running "copy table <table name> from 'filename'" into a unique
	btree only reports "E_CO0029 COPY: Copy terminated abnormally, 0
	rows successfully copied". It does not report "E_CO003F COPY:
	Warning: <n> rows not copied because duplciate key detected" when
	duplicates are encountered during the copy.
	(90968)


	(Generic)
	When creating a table as select field = :variable where variable is declared
	as varchar with NULL and NULL is assigned as value, it will create a table with
	a varchar column of length 0.
	(90970)


	The readlock=nolock lock mode is not honored when executing a
	select count(*) query against a btree table.
	(90993)


	Executing a select query with an outer join and a 'not in' subselect
	gives the wrong results back if the subselect is on a date field.
	(91007)


	The archive process fails to restart and issues message E_DMA464
	which indicates an invalid record exists in the transaction log.
	The situation may be caused when Ingres is killed (possibly during
	operating system failure) after a force abort when the previous
	consistency point occurred during the writing of a log record that
	spans log pages. Issuing logdump after the described force abort
	may also result in E_DMA464.
	(91054)


	Added support fo I2 and F4 datatypes, needed by Star.
	(91086)


	Oracle catalog owner is now INGRES, not SYSTEM.
	(91088)


	Fixed parser to handle many DATE() calls.
	(91089)


	Fixed parser to convert all DATE().
	(91090)


	(Generic)
	DBMS server sigsegv in gforce_page(), E_DM9049_UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION.
	This only happens when group buffers are enabled.
	(91094)


	Removed obsolete envviroment variables from replicator upgrades.
	(91211)


	(GENERIC)
	A subselect containing a correlated aggregate which is placed
	inside an "ifnull" statement causes the main query to return
	the wrong number of rows.
	E.g. query format;
	SELECT * FROM T1 ,T2 WHERE T1.col1 = T2.col1
	AND T1.date > (SELECT IFNULL(MAX(T1.date),'010198') from T1
	WHERE T1.col1=T2.col1 and T1.date > '010198'
	AND T1.col2 IN ('string'));
	(91232)


	A dynamic cursor, when opened, gives the errors
	"E_OP0795_ADF_EXCEPTION ADF exception - non-user error, ADF error
	return code returned in error block..." and "E_AD2004 ADF routine
	was passed an invalid datatype id." .
	(91409)


	(GENERIC)
	Executing a "select * from <table> ..." against large byte varying
	columns in the SQL Terminal Monitor  or ISQL causes the output to
	scroll over many lines. This may generate a SIGSEGV in either ISQL
	or an "unknown exception 10A65" in the SQL Terminal Monitor session.
	No errors are written to the error log file. This has been corrected.
	(91411)


	Issuing "help table <tablename>" causes an "E_OP078B consistency
	check" error. This happens when the Spanish collation sequence
	is used and statistics are applied with the "-zc" option of the
	optimizedb utility.
	(91425)


	The ABF READFILE function was unnecessarily using up system memory.
	(91439)


	OpenROAD no longer hangs on Win95 when issuing a COPY FROM and 
	connected locally to OpenIngres Desktop and running the OpenROAD
	application from an image (that is, using runimage).
	(91467)


	A display format of "zzz.nn" for a decimal field (5,2) would
	result in a 'Decimal overflow' error. Also, a display format of
	"f6.2" would display an incorrect value. This situation has now
	been corrected.
	(91491)


	(GENERIC)
	Verifydb reports W_DM500C orpahn data pages, on large heap tables,
	when in reality these are the second and subsequent FMAP pages.
	This is non-fatal, but verifydb should report correctly.
	Workaround: run a modify on the table, this recreates the table
	and the FMAP pages will then be interpreted correctly by verifydb.
	(91567)


	(GENERIC)
	Relocatedb db1 -new_database=db1.a will create a new local
	database called db1.a, which is syntactically wrong due to
	the special character dot.
	(91603)


	Error messages E_DU3150 and E_US0014 were changed to remove any
	references to CONVTO60. This is no longer relevant in this release
	of OpenIngres.
	(91643)


	On Windows NT, the ComSpec environment variable takes precedence over the SHELL environment variable.
	(91752)


	Setting work locations in a session to auxiliary work locations
	with 'set work location use (loc_name)' causes 'drop table' to fail
	with E_SC0206 (front-end) and E_DM001D, E_DM901F, E_QE0074, E_PS0D20,
	E_SC0215, E_PS0007, E_SC0206 (back-end). 'help table <table name>'
	fails with 'Sorry, Errors occured obtaining Help from iicolumns'
	(front-end) and E_DM001D, E_DM901F (back-end). Modifying the table

	(WindowsNT)
	This problem is a manifestation of a problem with parallel
	checkpointing on WindowsNT. 
	
	Parallel checkpointing has not been implemented on Windows NT.
	If the ckpdb command is issued with the #m[n] flag on Windows NT,
	the checkpoint will proceed and reports a succesfull completion but without
	having checkpointed the database. The result is an empty checkpoint
	location.
	When the rollforwarddb is attempted, with or without the #m[n], flag
	the database will become corrupted because of the missing files in the
	checkpoint location.
	
	The current problem will be resolved by preventing the use of the #m[n]
	flag on both ckpdb and rollforwarddb, in OpenIngres 2.0 and IngresII 2.0.
	If the #m[n] flag is used the following messages will be displayed and the
	checkpoint/rollforward will continue synchronously :-
	
	%@ CPP: Parallel checkpointing is not currently supported on WindowsNT.
		Proceeding with synchronous checkpoint
	
	%@ RFP: Parallel rollforward is not currently supported on WindowsNT.
		Proceeding with synchronous rollforward
	
	To prevent any future problems, all clients currently running OpenIngres 2.0
	and IngresII 2.0 on WindowsNT using the #m[n] flag, are strongly advised to 
	perform non-parallel checkpoints on all their databases including the system
	databases immediately.
	
	Parallel checkpointing for Windows NT will be implemented in Ingres 2.5.
