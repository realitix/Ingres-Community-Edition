<h2><a name="welcome">1.0  Welcome</a></h2>
<p>Welcome to Patch 8902 for Advantage Ingres 2.6 on windows.
This patch may be installed over any Advantage Ingres 2.6 Windows 
release, currently including 2.6/0201 and 2.6/0207.
This Readme contains important information about patch 8902 
, including how to install it on Windows
platforms, a list of all the problems that the patch
addresses, and technical support contact information. You

<h2><a name="installation_considerations">2.0  Installation Considerations</a></h2>
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="installation_on_windows_platforms">2.1  Installation on windows platforms</a></h3>
<p>To install this patch on windows platforms:
<ol>
	<p><li> Login as the INGRES super-user using  the "ingres" account.

        <p><li> Stop all INGRES processes;

	 <p>  a) If Ingres was started as a service then stop all related
              Ingres service(s) under Control Panel \ Services.

           <p>b) If Ingres was not started as a service use:

                ingstop

	  <p> c) if IVM is running, issue:

	        ivm -stop

	<p><li> If patch supplied on CD media then load into drive.

	<p><li> If you have downloaded the patch from the CA WEB site or if
           the CD you received contains a ZIP file, then you should 
           first unZIP the ZIP file to a temporary directory on a hard 
           drive.

	<p><li> Enter the following commands at a command prompt:

	   cd <drive containing unzipped version of the patch>
           install

	<p><li> Follow the instructions displayed on the screen to complete
	   the patch installation.

        <p><li> Restart the INGRES installation.

        <p>   a) If Ingres was stopped as a service then restart the
              related Ingres service(s) under Control Panel \ Services.

          <p> b) If Ingres was shutdown using ingstop use:

                Ingstart
</ol>
<p>
<p>During installation the following options are available :
<ol>
	<p><li> 'Force execution of patch install even if cdimage 
            verification fails'

	   This option forces the patch to be installed despite the 
           verification of the files to be installed failing. 
           This option should only be used on the advice of CA 
           technical support.

	<p><li> 'Backup files to be replaced in the installation'

           Any files that will be replaced during the installation 
           of this patch will be backed up to a specified directory. 
           The default directory is %II_SYSTEM%\ingres\install\backup.

	   It is recommended that this option be chosen as it allows 
           the patch to be uninstalled should that prove necessary.

	<p><li> 'Install Patch'

	   This option installs the patch.


	<p><li> 'View Patch Notes'

	   This option allows you to view the patch notes for this 
           patch release

	<p><li> 'Exit Installation'

	   This option will terminate the patch installation without
	   installing the patch

</ol>
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="de_installation_on_windows_platforms">2.2  De-installation on Windows Platforms</a></h3>
<p>Provided the patch was installed with the 'Backup.....' option checked
        you can uninstall the patch by using the following procedure.
<ol>
<p><li>Start the WindowsNT Explorer
<p><li>Locate the directory used as the backup during patch installation
           e.g. %II_SYSTEM%\ingres\install\backup
<p><li>Click and hold on the Ingres directory
           e.g. %II_SYSTEM%\ingres\install\backup\pre-pNNNN\ingres
           where NNNN is the patch number
<p><li>Drag this directory to the %II_SYSTEM% directory and release
<p><li>Answer 'Yes to all' when prompted.
<p>This sequence of steps moves the backup files back into the %II_SYSTEM%
	directory structure and overwrites those files that are already present.
<p>If you have multiple backup directories from multiple patch 
	installations care should be taken when deciding which directory to 
	use. For example, if you installed patch 1 and then installed a later 
	patch, patch 2, but decided to uninstall using the patch 1 backup 
	then this will cause both patch 1 and 2 to be uninstalled.
<p>If you have any doubts please contact your local CA Technical Support.
</ol>

        ABF/REPORT/SQL: Calculations which involve the division of a packed
        decimal datatype by an integer datatype may fail with E_AD1127
        (packed decimal overflow).

        When two decimals are being multiplied, it is assumed that the
        precision number indicates the exact number of significant digits
        of the decimal causing an overflow or unnecessary truncation.

        Hash joins are well known to be an alternative to sort merge join.
