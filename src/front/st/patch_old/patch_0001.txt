                Section 1 - General Notes
                -------------------------                         


        a) Please read the complete document before installing this
           patch. Ensure that the section 'Special Notes' is examined and
           an assessment made concerning the affect of notes headed
           'ATTENTION' and 'WARNING' for the specific installation. These
           notes contain special instructions that should be followed if
           your installation uses the associated product or feature.

        b) This patch may be installed over the following release
           versions only :

                II 2.0/0001 (int.w32/00)
                II 2.0/9808 (int.w32/00)
                II 2.0/9905 (int.w32/00)

           In all cases, once installation is complete the release
           identifier will be II 2.0/0001 (int.w32/00). This change
           will not affect system catalogs or user data.         

        c) Ensure you are running with minimum patch LO80296
           for LicenseIT Runtime.  Patches for LicenseIT
	   Runtime can be found on the download area of the
	   CA Support Web Site (http://support.ca.com).

        d) Although the patch installer saves overwritten files by
           default it is still recommended that a system backup is
           performed prior to the installation.



                Section 2 - Installation Instructions
                -------------------------------------


	Perform the following patch procedure for your Ingres
	installation. The patch is supplied on one cd.

        Perform the following patch procedure for your Ingres
        installation. The patch is supplied on one CD.

        1. Login as the INGRES super-user using  the "ingres" account.

        2. Stop all INGRES processes with the "ingstop" utility.

                ingstop

        3. Insert the CD if you have one.

        4. If you have downloaded the patch from the CA WEB site or if the 
	   CD you received contains a ZIP file, then you should first unZIP 
	   the ZIP file to a temporary directory on a hard drive.

        5. Type the following commands at a command prompt:

           cd <drive containing unzipped version of the patch>
           install

        6. Follow the instructions displayed on the screen to complete
           the patch installation.

        7. Restart the INGRES installation with the "ingstart" utility.

                Ingstart

        During installation the following options are available :-
        1. 'Force execution of patch install even if cdimage verification fails'
           This option forces the patch to be installed despite the verification
           of the files to be installed failing. This option should only be used
           on the advice of CA technical support.

        2. 'Backup files to be replaced in the installation'
           Any files that will be replaced during the installation of this patch
           will be backed up to a specified directory. The default directory is
           %II_SYSTEM%\ingres\install\backup
           It is recommended that this option be chosen as it allows the patch
           to be uninstalled should that prove necessary.

        3. 'Install Patch'
           Clicking this button will install the patch

           Installing this patch over previous releases II 2.0/9808 (int.wnt/00)
           II 2.0/9905 (int.wnt/00) will cause the installer to issue a warning
           that the installation will be upgraded to II 2.0/0001 (int.w32/00).
           The Y box must be selected to continue with the install.

        4. 'View Patch Notes'
           Clicking this button allows you to view the patch notes for this 
	   patch release.
 
        5. 'Exit Installation'
           Clicking this button will terminate the patch installation without
           installing the patch



                Section 3 - De-Installation Notes
                ---------------------------------

	
        Providing the patch was installed with the 'Backup.....' option checked
        you can uninstall the patch by using the following procedure.

        1. Start the WindowsNT Explorer

        2. Locate the directory used as the backup during patch installation
           e.g. %II_SYSTEM%\ingres\install\backup

        3. Click and hold on the Ingres directory
           e.g. %II_SYSTEM%\ingres\install\backup\pre-pNNNN\ingres
           where NNNN is the patch number

        4. Drag this directory to the %II_SYSTEM% directory and release

        5. Answer 'Yes to all' when prompted.

        This sequence of steps moves the backup files back into the %II_SYSTEM%
	directory structure and overwrites those files that are already present.


        If you have multiple backup directories from multiple patch 
	installations care should be taken when deciding which directory to 
	use. For example, if you installed patch 1 and then installed a later 
	patch, patch 2, but decided to uninstall using the patch 1 backup 
	then this will cause both patch 1 and 2 to be uninstalled.

        If you have any doubts please contact your local CA Technical Support.



                Section 4 - Special Notes
                -------------------------

                                                                               
        WARNING:  This patch contains fixes that render existing online
        checkpoints unusable (see bugs 97500 and 91957).  Once this patch
        is installed, checkpoints should immediately be performed on all
        applicable databases.

        If this patch is uninstalled and the installation is reverted to a
        previous version ( 2.0/9808 or 2.0/9505 ) then checkpoints taken
        between the patch install and uninstall will be invalidated.
                                                                            
        WARNING:  The following bug was found during the QA cycle:

	it was waiting for completed. Typical errors are
	E_CL0605 and E_CL0607.
	(48904)


	(GENERIC)
	Invocation of a select/retrieve query that uses the incorrect
	syntax of an aggregate function name, may result in invalid
	results or a SIGSEGV/SIGBUS in the dbms server.
	(74997)


	(GENERIC)
	Query with (inner) join and left join does not have

	Ambiguous Replace. Ambiguous Replace errors
	should not occur on Select statements.
	(83046)


	(VMS)
	Ingres start up stalls for 1 minute after the Recovery
	server is started.
	(86579)


	The test case involves creating a database, checkpointing the
	database, and then extending the database to a location which is
	in the same physical location as ii_database. Rollforwarding the
	database will fail with E_DM130D and E_DM1301.
	(87552)


	(GENERIC)
	IF a DBMS server is killed whilst holding a locking facility mutex,
	the DMFRCP server will SIGSEGV while reporting the errors E_DMA469,
	E_CL2529 and E_DMA009.
	(87612)

	Trace point qe90 causes various processes to crash when certain
	queries are executed using unions. The user may see the error
	E_DMA469 in the errlog.log .
	(93384)


	(GENERIC)
	Sporadic installation hangs in a heavily loaded multiple server
	installation due to an undetected mutex / scheduling deadlock.
	Not all servers will be accessible to iimonitor.    Problem is more
	likely if feature of altering session priority higher than the
	default value is used.    Most common scenario has most blocked
	sessions for visible servers in CS_COMPUTABLE/CS_MUTEX_MASK state
	spinning on a "RSH mutex".
	(95607)


	(MSSQL ONLY)
	EXECUTE PROCEDURE: Gateways do not support BYREF on parameters.
	This support is needed in some OpenROAD applications.  Support
	of BYREF is a requirement in order for some clients to migrate
	to OpenROAD 4.0 and gateways from OpenROAD 3.5 and drivers.
	Fixed for MSSQL Gateway 2.1 only.
	The Oracle gateway portion of this bug is now fixed in 103965.
	(95900)


	(GENERIC)
	When the OpenRoad ifnull() procedure is passed the same variable as
	is being assigned, the variable is set to an incorrect value. For
	example, var1 = ifnull(var1, '06/06/99').
	(96079)


	(GENERIC)
	With OR 3.5/03, setting the ING_SET=printqry redirected the PRINTQY
	output to the trace window. This is no longer possible with OR
	4.0/9803.
	(96123)


	(GENERIC)
	An Integer Nullable field has template 'zzn' and Inputmasking
	is switched on.  It should display zero by default but
	(97274)


	(GENERIC)
	Rollforwarddb fails to apply dump records from on online checkpoint.
	This can produce the following sequences of errors in the errlog.log
	during the rollforward.
	E_DM93AF/E_DM9006/E_DM9335/E_DM929C/E_DM967C/E_DM9606 or

	****************************************************************
	(97500)


	(GENERIC)
	When a database has multiple schemas with the same table name(s) and
	constraint name(s), COPYDB/UNLOADDB create incorrect copy.in scripts
	for the table constraints. Running the copy.in will result in the
	error  E_PS0495 CREATE/ALTER TABLE: Duplicate constraint name;
	a constraint with the name <constraint_name> already exists in
	schema <schema_name>.
	(97600)


        (NT)
        A GUI network utility, %II_SYSTEM%\ingres\vdba\ingnet.exe, has been 
	added for Windows NT and Windows '95.
        (98460)


	(GENERIC)
	Returning to the TABLES utility after calling ABF or RBF will always
	highlight the first row of the tables list when it should highlight
	the last chosen table.
	(98490)


	(UNIX)
	Building a large application is extremely slow. For this fix to
	be effective the archive command 'ar' must be in the search path.
	Only if the command line length is insufficient will the archive
	command be used.
	(98629)


	(GENERIC)
	ABF will receive error E_CG0006 when trying to compile a
	4GL statement involving a 4GL variable in a nested JOIN ON clause.
	(98775)


	(UNIX)
	Startup problems on multiprocessor machines. Symptoms vary
	from machine to machine. Sometimes the recovery server or
	dbms server hang during startup.
	(98804)


	(GENERIC)
	The DBMS server reports spurious SIGSEGVs in OS functions
	when using OS threads. Usually seen during high bursts of
	new sessions. Typically the SIGSEGVs are seen in memset(),
	OtsFill(), nxm_pthread_kill() or select().
	(98820)


	(GENERIC)
	ISQL fails with SIGSEGV and core dumped when executing a simple
	select statement against a table with a page size of 32K.
	(99136)


	(UNIX ONLY)
	Install for Oracle, Sybase, and Informix gateways returns an error
	after generating Gateway configuration.
	  Error displayed is:
	
	  The server cannot be started since II_AUTH_STRING is not defined.
	  Once you have entered a valid authorization string, you must
	  re-run
	  this setup program.
	
	Gateway is installed and usable after this point but the error can
	cause problems for unattended (batch) installations.
	(99790)


	(GENERIC)
	UPGRADEFE fails with Segmentation Fault core dumped (SIGSEGV)
	and E_DD0026, E_DD0009. It is run against a database created
	with the -fnofeclients flag and reloaded from 6.4 with
	reload.ing, as recommended in the 6.4 -> II upgrade cookbook.
	(99825)


	(NC4_US5 ONLY)
	A select on a view involving a three table join and large
	data sets results in server crash with SIGFPE and
	E_DM9049_UNKNOW_EXCEPTION on NCR. Errors E_DM004A and E_QE009C
	are also reported.
	(99864)


	(ORACLE and MS SQL Server)
	The logic for processing scalar functions in the Oracle and MS
	SQL Server Gateways has been completely rewritten. In previous
	releases, most of the Gateway scalar processing was done after
	rows were retrieved from the DBMS.  This led to numerous
	restrictions on where scalars could be used.  The biggest
	negative side effect of the previous scalar processing design was
	that it did not allow for support of nested scalar functions.  So
	for example, the following SQL was not allowed:
	
		select concat(trim(c1),trim(c2)) from t1;
	
	With this change to the Oracle and MS SQL Server Gateways, scalar
	functions may be nested.  In this release, all of the supported
	scalars are mapped to native DBMS SQL.  There is no scalar
	processing after rows have been fetched.  The following scalars
	require that a parameter be a literal value: _DATE, _TIME,
	DATE_GMT, DATE_PART, DBMS_INFO and SHIFT.
	
	The catalog build process has been changed to provide information
	on the new mapping of scalar functions into a new system table
	called iigwscalars.  This new gateway catalog, iigwscalars, will
	have the following columns:
	
	scalar_name - name identifying the scalar function
	
	translation - this column has one of four values.  RESTRICT
	indicates this scalar is supported but with restrictions.
	A restriction may be as simple as requiring a literal value
	for a parameter or may indicate a slight variation from the
	standard Ingres behavior for this scalar function.  COMPAT
	indicates that there is a native DBMS scalar that exactly
	matches the Ingres scalar. For COMPAT scalars the Gateways
	do no translation.  TRANS indicates that the scalar is
	translated to target DBMS SQL without restrictions.  NO
	means that a scalar is NOT SUPPORTED.
	
	parm1 - has a value of either LITERAL meaning that the
	first parameter to this scalar must be a literal value
	or EXPR meaning that both literal values and expressions
	are allowed for this parameter.
	
	parm2 - as in parm1, this can be either LITERAL or EXPR.
	
	parm3 - LITERAL or EXPR.
	
	mapping - this column documents the target DBMS SQL that
	is generated when the gateway does translations.
	
	commnt - comment
	(100080)


	(GENERIC)
	The Name Server does not reject IngresNet clients using an expired
	system password.
	(100276)


	(GENERIC)
	Query using a select with outer joins performs poorly. The query
	optimizer generates and chooses a bad QEP in which a sort is
	executed when a secondary index could have been used.
	(100286)


	(GENERIC)
	STAR: When executing certain queries on certain star servers the
	error E_OP0A01 QEP NOT USEFUL will be displayed. No QEP can be seen.
	This occurs usually when statistics exist on some or all tables.
	(100335)


	(GENERIC)
	SIGSEGV segmentation violation in PSF and errors E_PS0004,
	E_PS0002 when executing prepared queries of the form 'insert
	into ... select ...', 'create table ... as select ...' and
	'update ... from ...'.
	(100411)


	(GENERIC)
	When an ordering is requested (by order by or group by) on a set
	of columns which consists of the key columns (in order) of a
	unique Btree index, followed by one or more other columns, Ingres
	currently forces a sort to produce the desired order. It can be
	seen, though, that since each set of key columns produces a unique
	value, reading the data through the index will produce the
	requested order even with the added columns in the ordering. The
	sort is therefore an unnecessary overhead.
	(100482)


	(GENERIC)
	K-join cost is underestimated if there is a
	high repetition factor on a non-btree key.
	(100642)


	(GENERIC)
	Someone connecting directly to the server's listen port
	without sending any data to the server will cause the
	server to be unable to open any new connections.
	The server will not accept any new connections until
	the person blocking the port disconnects.
	
	To enable a timeout on direct connections perform
	the following steps after patch installation;
	
	cd $II_SYSTEM/ingres/utility
	iiinitres association_timeout
	cbf
	        Configure the DBMS server.
	        Edit the association_timeout to a non-zero value.
	        End and Save the changes.
	        Repeat for each DBMS server configuration as required.
	        Quit
	(100847)


	(GENERIC)
	Front end applications may hang when sending interrupts
	to the server.  GCA_TRACE shows GCA_ATTENTION is sent to
	the server, but a GCA_IACK is never sent back from the
	server.
	(100849)


	(NT-ONLY)
	'verifydb' will not work consistently when executed as a user who
	did not start Ingres.
	(100928)


	(VMS)
	Simultaneous calls to IISYSCHK.COM may fail due to access conflicts
	on a scratch file.  With clustered Ingres, this may possibly cause
	a startup failure on one or more nodes.
	(101006)


	(GENERIC)
	When a global temp table is modified failure is expected,
	you get E_DM005D in the errlog .  
	When you quit tm, you get E_DM9C75,
	E_DM9270, E_DM9267, E_SC010E, E_DM003F, E_DM003F, E_SC0122,
	E_SC010D, E_DM003F, E_DM003F in the errlog. 
	When you try and rerun tm, you get E_US0049 in frontend, and
	E_DM927F, E_SC010C, E_SC010D, E_DM0133, E_SC0121, E_SC010D, 
	E_DM0133, E_US0049, E_SC0123 in the errlog.

	(VMS)
	Scratch file simultaneous access problems for various DCL
	scripts.  To prevent this let IISDALL.COM (ingstop) check for 
	an orphaned CSP process as part of installation shutdown.

	(GENERIC)
	Intermittent E_LQ003A errors when running ABF
	while using both database procedures and database
	events.

	(USL ONLY)
	A select query on tables using money / float (either in
	sumation, or in the where clause) in different sessions
	on a multiple CPU (Unixware) machine results in
	incorrect and inconsistent results. Each run returns
	different results. Running query on its own always
	returns the correct results. No errors logged. Only
	occurs whilst using OS threads.

	(UNIX)
	A heavily loaded Ingres installation using OS threads may suffer
	performance degradation due to high contention on one or more
	of the bm_mpq or bm_fpq mutexes (semaphores).
	
	To address this, a new set of cache tuning parameters is
	provided.
	
	'dmf_pq_count' controls the number of priority queues for a
	particular page size.  Use of this parameter is only indicated
	in the rare situation where there exist performance problems
	due to contention on a bm_mpq or bm_fpq mutex.
	
	It is strongly advised that you use IPM or IIMONITOR to
	confirm contention on the priority queue mutexes before
	adjusting this parameter.
	
	Which page size and priority may need additional priority queues
	can be determined from the mutex name as follows:
	
	Given a mutex name of "bm_[f|m]pq <page_size>.<priority>.<n>",
	where "bm_[f|m]pq" indicates either bm_fpq or bm_mpq and <page_size>
	will be 2048, 4096, etc. and <priority> will be a page priority
	in the range 0 - 7, and <n> will be an instance identifier for
	the mutex (typically 0), the controlling parameter will be the
	(<priority>+1)th element of the priority queue split factor list
	for the dmf_pq_count parameter for the specific <page_size>
	buffer cache.
	
	Values for this setting take the form of a comma separated list of
	integers in the range 1 - 8.  First list element is the number of
	"page priority 0" queues to allocate, the second the number of
	"page priority 1" queues to allocate, up to the highest page
	priority of 7.  Elements absent from end of list default to 1.
	
	Setting a value higher than 1 for any priority, introduces the
	possibility that certain actions will not effect the absolutely
	oldest page buffer in a given cache, since the oldest buffer in
	one queue may be younger than the oldest buffer in one of the
	other queues for this page size and priority.  This may possibly
	cause a small decrease in cache hit rate.
	
	This parameter will normally not appear in config.dat, but
	may be added using 'iiinitres dmf_pq_count'.   This will create
	initial default settings of 'dmf_pq_count' for all pages sizes and
	cache definitions.   The default settings maintain the existing
	behavior or allocating one modified, and one free page buffer
	queue for each priority and page size in use.
	
	Once added, dmf_pq_count settings may be viewed and
	maintained in CBF.

	after DST.  For example 29-Mar-1992 02:00 will be inserted as
	29-Mar-1992 01:00, the correct value should be 29-Mar-1992 03:00 as
	the hour 'jumps' forward to DST at 02:00.  This is only a problem
