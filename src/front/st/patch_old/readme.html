</a></H3>
<P>To install this Service Pack on Windows platforms: 
<OL style="list-style-type: decimal">
  <P>
  <br>
  <LI>Log on to your Windows machine. <b>
  Note: </span></b>
  To install this Service 
  Pack on the Ingres DBMS, you must log on as the “ingres” user. For 
  client installations, you can log on as any user.<br>
    <br>
  <br>
    
  <li>Stop all Ingres 
  processes with the INGSTOP utility or through the Ingres Visual Manage (IVM). 
  You will also need to stop IVM either by issuing the command &quot;ivm -stop&quot; or by 
  right clicking on the IVM icon and choosing the Exit menu option.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
 </li>
  <li>If Service Pack is supplied on CD media then load into drive. If you have 
  downloaded the Service Pack from the CA web site or if<br>
  the CD you received contains a ZIP file, then you should first un-ZIP the ZIP 
  file into a temporary directory.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Run install.exe from the CD drive or from the temporary directory.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Follow the instructions displayed on the screen to complete the Service
    Pack installation.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Restart the Ingres instance.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
</OL>
<p>During installation the following options are available:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
  <li>&quot;Force execution of patch install even if cdimage verification fails&quot; - This option forces the Service Pack to be installed despite the 
  verification of the files to be installed failing. This option should only be 
  used on the advice of CA technical support.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>&quot;Backup files to be replaced in the installation&quot; - Any files that will be 
  replaced during the installation of this Service Pack will be backed up to a 
  specified directory. The default directory is %II_SYSTEM%\ingres\install\backup. 
  It is recommended that this option be chosen as it allows the Service Pack to be 
  uninstalled should that prove necessary.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>&quot;Install Patch&quot; - This option installs the Service Pack.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>&quot;View Patch Notes&quot; - This option allows you to view the README for this
    Service Pack.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>&quot;Exit Installation&quot; - This option will terminate the Service
    Pack installation 
  without installing the Service Pack.<br>
  </li>
</ol>

<H3><a name="de_installation_on_windows_platforms">2.2 Uninstalling on Windows 
Platforms<br>
</a></H3>
<P>
Providing the Service Pack was installed with the 'Backup.....' option checked the
Service Pack may be uninstalled using the following procedure:<br>
<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
  <li>Start the Windows Explorer.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Locate the directory used as the backup during Service Pack installation, e.g.
    %II_SYSTEM%\ingres\install\backup.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Click and hold on the Ingres directory, e.g. %II_SYSTEM%\ingres\install\backup\pre-p&lt;patch#&gt;\ingres 
  where &lt;patch#&gt; is the patch number.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Drag this directory to the %II_SYSTEM% directory and release.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<P>
Answer 'Yes to all' when prompted.<br>
<P>
This sequence of steps moves the backup files back into the %II_SYSTEM% 
directory structure and overwrites those files that are already present.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you have multiple backup directories from multiple patch installations care 
should be taken when deciding which directory to use. For example, if patch 1 
was installed, and then later patch 2 was installed, uninstalling using the 
patch 1 backup will cause both patch 1 and 2 to be uninstalled.<br>

<br>
<p>(GENERIC)<br>
optimizedb -zs100.0 is rejected with error E_OP094E '-zs' flag<br>
must be followed by a number in the (0.0, 100.0) range expressing<br>
percentage of table rows to be sampled.<br>

<br>
(GENERIC)<br>
Rollforwarddb aborts when it is used against a multi-location<br>
database in which two locations point to the same physical area.<br>
(39563) (INGSRV1956)<br>
<br>
(GENERIC)<br>
Embedded SQL statement names used in PREPARE and DESCRIBE for&nbsp;<br>
example, can now be set to 32 characters without resulting in&nbsp;<br>
error E_US0900.<br>
(43805)<br>
<br>
(GENERIC)<br>
REPLICATOR: When vertical partitioning is setup, even if a<br>
non replicated column is updated, replicator performs<br>
data capture, creates shadow and archive table records, etc.<br>
This is not necessary and leads to performance overhead.<br>
(69562) (INGREP58)<br>

<br>
(UNIX)<br>
ingbuild does not work correctly when the path given for II_DATABASE,<br>
II_CHECKPOINT, etc., matches a part of another path which is shown<br>
by the &quot;df&quot; command.&nbsp; Actually, the problem occurs when
II_DATABASE,<br>
etc. exists on a Network FileSystem (NFS).&nbsp; In such a situation, &quot;df&quot;<br>
returns mount point for II_DATABASE, prepended with the node name<br>
and a colon as a field separator.&nbsp; Within iidsfree, which interprets<br>
the output of &quot;df&quot; to determine whether II_DATABASE has sufficient
free<br>
space, the colon is treated as a field separator so that the mount&nbsp;<br>
point is shifted into the position where space values are expected.<br>
This change copes with that shift.<br>
(79518) (INGINS69)<br>
<br>
(GENERIC)<br>
When copying a table which has a column of data type long polygon,<br>
the output file grows in size until it fills up the disk, at which<br>

When a user other than &quot;ingres&quot; tries to create a location in&nbsp;<br>
accessdb, no error is reported and the location will be created<br>
successfully even though the location path does not exist.<br>
(87619) (INGCBT257)<br>
<br>
(GENERIC)<br>
On transaction abort, resulting from removing the session via<br>
ipm, the errors reported to the errlog.log are incorrect. The<br>
errors reported are E_DM010C, E_QE0024 and E_DM9059. These errors<br>
indicate that the abort is being performed due to a logfile&nbsp;<br>
full situation which is not the case.<br>
(90402) (INGSRV1182)<br>
<br>
(GENERIC)<br>
When creating a table as select field = :variable where variable is<br>
declared as varchar with NULL and NULL is assigned as value, it will<br>
create a table with a varchar column of length 0.<br>

Running an ABF image which includes a 4GL procedure will result in<br>
&quot;This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut<br>
down&quot;. The 4GL 'ReadFile' command is being used.<br>
(92444)<br>

CBF only displays the networking protocols selected at installation&nbsp;<br>
time, in fact it should display all protocols with a status of on&nbsp;<br>
or off accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Also, any value may be input for the protocol status - it should&nbsp;<br>

Inner join queries coded with the new ANSI/ISO join syntax may<br>
not produce optimal plans, even though they are semantically<br>
equivalent to queries coded with an old style from clause. In<br>

An heavily loaded Ingres installation using OS threads may suffer&nbsp;<br>
performance degradation due to high contention on one or more&nbsp;<br>
of the bm_mpq or bm_fpq mutexes (semaphores).<br>
<br>
To address this, a new set of cache tuning parameters is<br>
provided.<br>
<br>
'dmf_pq_count' controls the number of priority queues for a&nbsp;<br>
particular page size.&nbsp; Use of this parameter is only indicated&nbsp;<br>
in the rare situation where there exist performance problems&nbsp;<br>
due to contention on a bm_mpq or bm_fpq mutex.<br>
<br>
It is strongly advised that you use IPM or IIMONITOR to<br>
confirm contention on the priority queue mutexes before<br>
adjusting this parameter.<br>
<br>
Which page size and priority may need additional priority queues<br>
can be determined from the mutex name as follows:<br>
<br>
Given a mutex name of &quot;bm_[f|m]pq &lt;page_size&gt;.&lt;priority&gt;.&lt;n&gt;&quot;,<br>
where &quot;bm_[f|m]pq&quot; indicates either bm_fpq or bm_mpq and &lt;page_size&gt;<br>
will be 2048, 4096, etc. and &lt;priority&gt; will be a page priority<br>
in the range 0 - 7, and &lt;n&gt; will be an instance identifier for<br>
the mutex (typically 0), the controlling parameter will be the<br>
(&lt;priority&gt;+1)th element of the priority queue split factor list<br>
for the dmf_pq_count parameter for the specific &lt;page_size&gt;&nbsp;<br>
buffer cache.<br>
<br>
Values for this setting take the form of a comma separated list of<br>
integers in the range 1 - 8.&nbsp; First list element is the number of<br>
&quot;page priority 0&quot; queues to allocate, the second the number of<br>
&quot;page priority 1&quot; queues to allocate, up to the highest page<br>
priority of 7.&nbsp; Elements absent from end of list default to 1.<br>
<br>
Setting a value higher than 1 for any priority, introduces the<br>
possibility that certain actions will not effect the absolutely<br>
oldest page buffer in a given cache, since the oldest buffer in<br>
one queue may be younger than the oldest buffer in one of the<br>
other queues for this page size and priority.&nbsp; This may possibly&nbsp;<br>
cause a small decrease in cache hit rate.<br>
<br>
This parameter will normally not appear in config.dat, but<br>
may be added using 'iiinitres dmf_pq_count'.&nbsp;&nbsp; This will create<br>
initial default settings of 'dmf_pq_count' for all pages sizes and<br>
cache definitions.&nbsp;&nbsp; The default settings maintain the existing<br>
behavior or allocating one modified, and one free page buffer<br>
queue for each priority and page size in use.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Once added, dmf_pq_count settings may be viewed and&nbsp;<br>
maintained in CBF.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

	Complex query may hang in optimizer facility and doesn't come back.&nbsp;<br>
	On systems with internal threads the dbms server becomes unavailable&nbsp;<br>
	and eats all CPU. In a multiple dbms server environment the other&nbsp;<br>
	servers will hang some time later, no connect to the database is&nbsp;<br>
	possible (but the other servers are reachable with iimonitor).&nbsp;<br>
	To stop the system the dbms server has to be killed (kill -9),&nbsp;<br>
<br>
	A tracepoint has been added to provide a method of tripping out<br>
	the query when the cpu usage of the query becomes excessive.<br>
<br>
	The usage is:<br>
		set trace point OP248  max_cpu warn_cpu<br>
<br>
	where&nbsp;<br>
	max_cpu is the maximum time (in milli-second) before the&nbsp;<br>
		 query will exit from the optimizer and, if a&nbsp;<br>
		 plan has been found, run the query.<br>
<br>
	warn_cpu is the time (in milli-second) after which the&nbsp;<br>
		  query plan will be reported, together with&nbsp;<br>
		  statistical estimates of the time to complete<br>
		  and the cpu used so far.  The query will also<br>
		  be written to the error log and dbms log.<br>
<br>
	An environment variable will also be checked and if the value&nbsp;<br>
	is set to a non 0 value, the query will be tripped out&nbsp;<br>
	immediately by default or when set to a non-zero value.<br>
<br>
	ingsetenv II_OPF_FORCE_TIMEOUT  [0|1]<br>
<br>
	    Note: this must be set system wide using ingsetenv.<br>
	  		It should only be set once a query has been identified&nbsp;<br>
	 		 as running for a long time.<br>
<br>
	No guidance is provided on what is excessive for a given system.<br>
	In testing I have used the following command:<br>
<br>
	    set trace point OP248 90000 5000&nbsp;<br>
<br>
	which has provided adequate during testing.<br>
<br>
	Note:  The value of II_OPF_FORCE_TIMEOUT is only checked<br>
	   after 5 * warn_cpu has expired.  At this point<br>
	   the session is suspended for 1 second after each<br>
	   N potential plans have been examined.&nbsp;<br>
	   N is defined as the warn_cpu value.    This allows the<br>

	   iimonitor for session that are cpu intensive and&nbsp;<br>

	A query of the form 'select * from tab where<br>

	(96064) (INGSRV776)<br>
<br>
	(GENERIC)<br>
	The "COPY TABLE table_name ( column_name=... ) FROM ..." command does<br>
	not assign the correct default value for columns not specified in the<br>
	column list. When a column not supporting NULL is omitted from the<br>
	column list, the implicit default value for the column type is used<br>
	(e.g. 0 for INT), rather than the explicit default defined for that<br>
	column.<br>
<br>
	Please note that after applying the fix for this bug, columns defined<br>
	with NOT NULL NOT DEFAULT will cause "E_US0ADB No value specified for<br>
	mandatory column 'column_name'" to be reported if an attempt is made<br>
	to copy in data and the column is not specified in the column list.<br>
	(77895) (INGSRV1981)<br>

	UPDATE and DELETE queries without a WHERE clause sets SQLWARN4<br>
	when used outside of a PREPARE statement. This contradicts<br>
	the specification of the SQLWARN4 definition in the SQL Reference<br>
	guide.<br>
