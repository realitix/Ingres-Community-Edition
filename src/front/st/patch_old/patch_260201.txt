                         Section 1 - General Notes 
                         -------------------------

	a) Please read the complete document before installing this  
	   patch. Ensure that the section Special Notes is examined, 
           and an assessment made concerning the affect of notes 
           headed 'ATTENTION and WARNING for the specific 
           installation. These notes contain special instructions 
           that should be followed if your installation uses the 
           associated product or feature. 

	b) This patch may be installed over the following release
           version only : 
         
                2.6/0201 (int.w32/00)
                2.6/0201 (int.w32/05)

        c) Although the patch installer saves overwritten files by
	   default, it is still recommended that a system backup is
	   performed prior to the installation. 


                      Section 2 - Installation Instructions
                      -------------------------------------

	Perform the following procedure to install the patch.

	1. Login as the INGRES super-user using  the "ingres" account.

        2. Stop all INGRES processes;

	   a) If Ingres was started as a service then stop all related
              Ingres service(s) under Control Panel \ Services.

           b) If Ingres was not started as a service use:

                ingstop

	   c) if IVM is running, issue:

	        ivm -stop

	3. If patch supplied on CD media then load into drive.

	4. If you have downloaded the patch from the CA WEB site or if
           the CD you received contains a ZIP file, then you should 
           first unZIP the ZIP file to a temporary directory on a hard 
           drive.

	5. Enter the following commands at a command prompt:

	   cd <drive containing unzipped version of the patch>
           install

	6. Follow the instructions displayed on the screen to complete
	   the patch installation.

        7. Restart the INGRES installation.

           a) If Ingres was stopped as a service then restart the
              related Ingres service(s) under Control Panel \ Services.

           b) If Ingres was shutdown using ingstop use:

                Ingstart

	During installation the following options are available :

	1. 'Force execution of patch install even if cdimage 
            verification fails'

	   This option forces the patch to be installed despite the 
           verification of the files to be installed failing. 
           This option should only be used on the advice of CA 
           technical support.

	2. 'Backup files to be replaced in the installation'

           Any files that will be replaced during the installation 
           of this patch will be backed up to a specified directory. 
           The default directory is %II_SYSTEM%\ingres\install\backup.

	   It is recommended that this option be chosen as it allows 
           the patch to be uninstalled should that prove necessary.

	3. 'Install Patch'

	   This option installs the patch.


	4. 'View Patch Notes'

	   This option allows you to view the patch notes for this 
           patch release

	5. 'Exit Installation'

	   This option will terminate the patch installation without
	   installing the patch

	
	
                  Section 3 - De-Installation Instructions
	          ----------------------------------------

	Providing the patch was installed with the 'Backup.....' 
        option checked the patch may be uninstalled using the 
        following procedure.

	1. Start the Windows Explorer

	2. Locate the directory used as the backup during patch 
           installation
	   e.g. %II_SYSTEM%\ingres\install\backup

	3. Click and hold on the Ingres directory
	   e.g. %II_SYSTEM%\ingres\install\backup\pre-pNNNN\ingres
	   where NNNN is the patch number

	4. Drag this directory to the %II_SYSTEM% directory and 
           release

	5. Answer 'Yes to all' when prompted.
	 
	This sequence of steps moves the backup files back into 
        the %II_SYSTEM% directory structure and overwrites those files 
        that are already present.
	
	If you have multiple backup directories from multiple patch 
        installations care should be taken when deciding which directory 
        to use. For example, if patch 1 was installed, and then later 
        patch 2 was installed, uninstalling using the patch 1 backup 
        will cause both patch 1 and 2 to be uninstalled.

	If you have any doubts please contact your local CA Technical 
        Support.


                            Section 4 - Special Notes
                            -------------------------


	There are no special notes for this patch.


			  Section 5 - Ingres Corrections
			  ------------------------------

Specific problem(s) solved in this patch :

	(GENERIC)
	When attempting to create a view using a long varchar or long byte
	column of a table, E_US1263 is received by the front end and
	E_DM0072, E_DM9B07, and E_DM9028 are written to the error log.
	(103857)

	(GENERIC)
	If the min aggregate is computed on a date column with a group of
	rows whose only non-null values are the empty date, the result is
	incorrectly computed to be "Dec. 31, 9999".
	(107694)

	(GENERIC)
	A max or min aggregate function on a date column can produce a null
	result. This should only happen for non-nullable date columns.
	(107768)

	(GENERIC)
	Ingres would incorrectly report a licensing violation for an OLF based
	on hardware capacity units, if more than one user would connect to a
	DBMS server.
	(107777)

	(WINDOWS ONLY)
	After applying patch 8279, the Ingres service does not start anymore.
	This has been fixed.
	(107784)

Other problems solved in this patch:


	(GENERIC)
	The row producing procedure feature adds a "for" loop to the
	procedure language to retrieve multiple rows from a select
	statement. It also adds a "return row" statement to construct
	row images to be sent to the caller. "result row" syntax is
	added to the execute procedure statement of ESQL, along with
	the ability to code a loop containing host language statements
	in the same way as a select loop. Rows returned from the
	procedure execution will drive the loop execution.
	Slight correction of error detection - row procs called from
	TM, dyn SQL or another procedure.
	(101377)


	(GENERIC)
	Corrected the -aborted_transaction flag for auditdb to write correct
	format for BT and ET records
	(102521)

        (NT-ONLY)
        The NT Ingres installer now queries the operating system for
        the timezone being used and then uses this information to set the 
	default Ingres timezone.
	(102772)

	(GENERIC)
	Attempting to pass a blob to a procedure invoked by a rule results
	in an E_QE0002_INTERNAL_ERROR followed by a SIGBUS. A second attempt
	to do such, resuts in the dbms server crashing.
	(103156)


	(GENERIC)
	The ICE macro language has been redesigned. It is now well formed
	according to the XML rules. In conjunction with the ICE DTD an
	XML aware editor may be used to aid development of ICE pages.
	(103810)


	(UNIX)
	IIMONITOR: remove <sid> where <sid> is an invalid session ID
	results in a SIGSEGV in the DBMS.
	(103872)


	(GENERIC)
	If you create a Global Temporary Table with the same name but a
	different structure to an existing permanent table, then attempts
	to use the table will cause E_OP0082 errors and a SIGSEGV in
	opc_keyqual in the error log.
	Bug is refixed. Original fix disabled 2.5 "model histograms for
	global temporary tables" feature.
	(104342)


	(GENERIC)
	Manipulation of a global temporary table which has the same name
	as a permanent table may result in corruption of the permanent
	table and/or E_DM0056 errors.
	(104476)


	(NT-ONLY)
	Ingres now works in an environment where II_SYSTEM contains
	embedded spaces.
	(105212)


	(UNIX)
	The data to be imported is properly displayed and formatted during
	'Part 2' if IIA on UNIX.
	(105486))
	
	(GENERIC)
	Support global temporary tables in the CallableStatement interface.
	The following syntax is now supported for OpenSQL syntax:
	
	[execute procedure | callproc ] [schema.]procname ( param_name
	    = session.global_temp_table)
	
	The following syntax is now supported for standard JDBC syntax:
	
	{ call [schema.]procname( session.global_temp_table ) }
	
	The "session." syntax is a keyword, and must always be
	included.  The global_temp_table clause is the name of a global
	temporary table that was created prior to the execution of the
	database procedure.
	(105521)


	(GENERIC)
	A "not in" subselect query used to run in a few seconds and now
	takes a very long time, most of it CPU bound in OPF.
	(105565)


	(GENERIC)
	New releases of Ingres that introduce additional reserved words
	inevitably result in syntax errors in applications written long
	before that use one of the reserved words as an entity name (table,
	column, etc.). The request is to make Ingres parsers treat reserved
	words in a context sensitive manner so they only cause errors when
	used in an ambiguous context.
	Apply changes to Ingres host language precompilers, too.
	Change a GLOBALDEF to GLOBALREF.
	(105811)


	(GENERIC)
	The documentation and implementation of float(n) columns seems to
	incorporate a mixture of decimal digit precision (7 or less yields
	a 4 byte float) and binary precision (53 or less yields a 8 byte
	float). Both should be made consistent (either both in decimal
	digits or both in binary digits).
	Minor addition to make float(8) generate 4 byte float instead of 8.
	Fix to length/precision computation to fix OP08A2 in 3.0.
	(105957)


	(GENERIC)
	A query containing a "not in" subselect that references a union
	view gets a OP0384 error and will not compile.
	(105978)


	(GENERIC)
	complex query may hang in optimizer facility and doesn't come back.
	On systems with internal threads the dbms server becomes unavailable
	and eats all CPU. In a multiple dbms server environment the other
	servers will hang some time later, no connect to the database is
	possible(but the other servers are reachable with iimonitor).
	To stop the system the dbms server has to be killed(kill -9),
	often the recovery must be killed too.
	Submitted to 2.6, too.
	(106068)


	(UNIX)
	All text on first screen of IIA is now displayed correctly.
	(106168)


	(GENERIC)
	In a multithreaded ESQL program resembling a terminal handler
	with multiple threads connecting and disconnecting and issuing
	a variety of SQL statements, on very fast CPUs, the program
	tends to cause errors such as E_LQ00BF and E_LQ002E, and at
	times these result in a SEGV.
	(106240)


	(GENERIC)
	Added new option -param_file to copydb command to read the input
	flags from a file.
	
	modified utexe.def for the new syntax.
	Corrected usage message to reflect correct use of copydb -param_file
	flag.
	(106249)


	(GENERIC)
	Sysmod dbname -page_size=N does not change the page size for front
	end catalogs.
	(106305)


	(GENERIC)
	Server may hang, IIMONITOR shows sessions in a CS_MUTEX state
	on RSB/LLB mutexes. Stack dump shows some threads in the
	scavenge() function, others in LK_request_lock() and/or
	LK_do_unlock().
	(106306)


	(GENERIC)
	(HET NET) A FIRST class character set mapping has been defined
	between the coded character sets ISO8859/1 and IBMPC850. This
	should improve character throughput in this environment.
	(106314)


	(GENERIC)
	Insert statements that assign values to byte columns using the
	byte(nnn) function with integer data can produce incorrect data on
	non-byte swapped machines. Likewise, any "=" predicate involving
	a byte column may not qualify any rows.
	(106378)


	(UNIX)
	VDBA's dependency on liblic98.so on UNIX has now been reolved.
	(106401)


	(UNIX)
	At run-time, 'impxml' and 'ICETranslate' will properly resolve
	the necessary shared libraries.
	(106415)


	(WINDOWS ONLY)
	The new Ingres installer now works on Microsoft 64-bit operating
	systems.
	(106451)


	(HP-UX ONLY)
	After reaching the maximum number of sessions, as defined in the
	"Preferences" dialog for Visual DBA, clicking the OK button on
	the subsequent "Connection failure." dialog causes VDBA to crash
	with a SIGABRT. This has been fixed.
	(106479)


	(GENERIC)
	The Ingres documentation has been updated to reflect the changes
	needed.
	(106489)


	(UNIX)
	Fix various Raw location problems in 2.6 GA release.
	Raw locations are now supported on HP-UX 11.x platforms.
	(106501)


	(GENERIC)
	The "declare global tempoorary table as select first n ..."
	statement doesn't apply the "first n" restriction. All rows are
	inserted into the table. The same thing happens to "create table
	as select first n" statements with nojournaling set.
	(106516)


	(NT ONLY)
	The messaged logged in the Windows Event Log shows and error type
	for an informative message and is also unable to locate the
	resource where the message is located.
	(106529)


	(GENERIC)
	Dbms server config parameters to enable/disable page types are
	ignored.
	(106530)


	(GENERIC)
	The like predicate currently only allows the pattern string to be
	a character constant or host variable. ANSI SQL allows it to be any
	character expression, including simple column references.
	(106540)


	(LINUX ONLY)
	IIA no longer fails to read data from CSV files on Linux.
	(106614)


	(GENERIC)
	References to "Release Notes" have been changed to "README".
	(106617)


	(GENERIC)
	Advantage Ingres Product explorer is now up to date.
	(106622)


	(GENERIC)
	The PTR field in DB_DATA_VALUE used to define GCA_COL_ATT
	causes problems on 64-bit machines due to the change in
	size of PTR types.  GCA failures result between 32-bit and
	64-bit processes because the GCA_TDESCR message is built
	with different data sizes.
	
	The PTR field in GCA_ELEMENT causes similar problems.
	(106709)


	(GENERIC)
	In IIA, when using the "servers/INGRES" tree branch in Step 1 for
	accessing the database, non-Ingres column types such as "money"
	were not proposed in step 3.  This has been fixed.
	(106737)


	(GENERIC)
	The printout of the site id heading is now "Site ID".
	(106744)


	(GENERIC)
	Using alter table to create a referential constraint on a table
	where the  Foreign Key Index Enforcement is set to <no index> no
	more generates error  E_US0F09 Syntax error on '"no index"'
	(106802)


	(WINDOWS ONLY)
	Executing "ingstart -help" causes an Accesss Violation. This has
	been fixed.
	(106814)


	(DOCUMENTATION)
	The Ingres Migration Guide has been updated to contain the
	"Upgrading  Your Installation" secrion from the Readme.
	(106835)


	(GENERIC)
	Fixed unicode collation algorithm ( combining characters case).
	(106836)


	(GENERIC)
	IIA now works correctly if user puts a number of kB to pre-scan, in
	the "[optional] Format Idendification on First [n] Kb of File"
	control, which is bigger than the effective size of the file to be
	imported.
	(106844)


	(WINDOWS ONLY)
	Messages S_ST0540_cannot_run_rcpstat and
	S_ST0543_cannot_run_rcpstat2 are now not printed when
	starting/stopping Ingres via the Windows  Service Manager.
	(106852)


	(GENERIC)
	Reading collation file is not thread safe, causing dbms server to
	SEGV.
	(106873)


	(GENERIC)
	"Alter Installation password" no more fails in VDBA.
	(106906)


	(GENERIC)
	Selecting data from an nchar column, using Ingres/ICE, does not
	produce the correct results.
	(106926)


	(GENERIC)
	Row-producing procedures that return at least one varchar element
	can (will?) cause a SEGV in the Ingres server.
	(106935)


	(UNIX)
	ingbuild will no longer allow non-alphanumeric characters
	in the II_SYSTEM path definition since they cause problems
	in subsequent setup programs. Only alphabetic characters
	(including accented), digits and underscore will be allowed.
	(106947)


	(GENERIC)
	The list of privileges is now displayed correctly in the VDBA
	"Create Profile" dialog under Windows 2000.
	(106953)


	(GENERIC)
	The bug consists of 2 coding errors. In adu1dates.h, a series of
	DEFINE constants are coded as decimal values, though they are
	clearly intended to be hex. They are always used with & and |
	operators and the values are powers of 2. If left as decimal
	constants, some values overlap others and could lead to execution
	errors. In adulldates.c, the  AD_DN_MONTHSPEC flag is not set in
	the status field of a converted internal date in cases where there
	clearly is a month value. Execution errors have been avoided by
	dropping the status field in certain operations (like hash executed
	on dates). But this is clearly wrong.
	(106958)


	(GENERIC)
	When inserting data into a primary non unique btree, created with
	noduplicates, page_size = 2048, the dbms server does duplicate row
	checking and then inserts the key onto the wrong leaf page. A
	subsequent select to retrieve the new row will return zero rows.
	(106984)


	(GENERIC)
	E_SC0216, E_SC0206 followed by SIGSEGV in qso_destroy()
	when a select cursor exceeds the MAXROW limit.
	(106986)


	(GENERIC)
	E_CL1035_LK_EVENT_BAD_PARAM, E_CL103E_LK_REQUEST_BAD_PARAM,
	E_DMA406_LG_WRITE_BAD_STAT (Phantom Resume) when creating
	parallel indexes.  This may manifest itself as fatal server
	errors in LK or LG.
	(107008)


	(GENERIC)
	The DatabaseMetaData method getIdentifierQuoteString() returns a
	double quote for IMS and VSAM gateways even though delimited
	identifiers are not supported.  The JDBC spec indicates that a
	space, ' ', should be returned in this case.
	(107014)


	(GENERIC)
	Repeated selecting from a table containing unicode data eventually
	causes an unhandled exception E_OP0901_UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION.
	 Repeated selecting from a table containing unicode data eventually
	 causes
	  an unhandled exception E_OP0901_UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION. (More Changes).
	crossing changes to 3.0
	(107016)


	(GENERIC)
	Fixed min operation on NCHAR columns.
	Fixed min operation on NVARCHAR column.
	(107034)


	(GENERIC)
	JDBC driver tracing should include timestamps for performance
	related issues.
	(107037)


	(GENERIC)
	Sigbus doing comparison of NVCHR or NCHR data.
	(107084)


	(LINUX ONLY)
	Installation will no longer fail if machines hostname is in UPPER
	CASE
	(107141)


	(GENERIC)
	The JDBC PreparedStatement method setTimestamp() when passed
	a null parameter should send a SQL NULL value to the DBMS (as
	documented in JDBC specification).
	(107174)


	(GENERIC)
	Attempting to access the NULLABLE column of the result-set
	produced by the JDBC method getColumns() using the method
	getInt() results in an exception being thrown.
	(107175)


	(GENERIC)
	Using JDBC BigDecimal for parameter values fails against the DB2
	gateway.
	(107184)


	(GENERIC)
	If the name server is not running, ingstart attempts to start the
	dbms server without checking for other running processes mapped to
	the shared memory segment.  It does an ipcclean, then starts the
	recovery and dbms servers, etc.  As a result, two sets of servers
	may be running, and data corruption is possible (see bug 101178).
	Also, ingstop will then fail to stop all the servers, requiring
	manual cleanup via OS commands.
	(107199)


	(WINDOWS ONLY)
	If Ingres is running, and the uninstaller is invoked, after
	closing WINSTART the uninstaller will hang forever in the
	background doing nothing. This has been fixed.
	(107214)


	(GENERIC)
	E_AD7004_BAD_BLOB, E_SC0216_QEF_ERROR, E_SC0206_CANNOT_PROCESS
	errors selecting right(blob_column, 10) on an Ingres DOUBLEBYTE
	installation, where blob_column is defined as long varchar.
	(107224)


	(GENERIC)
	An ESQL program selecting rows from a table based on a "="
	comparison of a NCHAR column with a w_char host variable value
	could not find matching rows even though there were some. This
	failure only occurred on a double byte server. The same test works
	properly on a server without double byte enabled.
	(107251)


	(GENERIC)
	JDBC driver throws ExceptionInInitializerError when running in Sun
	1.4 browser plugin for Internet Explorer.
	(107269)


	(UNIX)
	Ingstart no longer fails to start net server (iigcc) in client only
	installation on UNIX.
	(107278)


	(GENERIC)
	If there are spaces in the II_SYSTEM variable, there is no more
	error generated by IJA when trying to view journals at the table
	level, or to recover or redo transactions.
	(107292)


	(GENERIC)
	The sql test in vdba now behaves correctly when we turn the setting
	"Show the non-select statement" off and execute the non-select
	statement.
	(107333)


	(GENERIC)
	Very complex queries with large intermediate results and numerous
	or'ed subselects each containing joins produce incorrect results
	and, in some cases, QEF internal errors.
	(107335)


	(GENERIC)
	implemented ifnull() function for nchar and nvarchar datatypes.
	crossing changes from main to ingres26.
	(107361)


	(GENERIC)
	Optimizedb failed (SEGV) due to memory overlay in GCA facility
	(107364)


	(GENERIC)
	The Transaction Log branches now appear correctly in IVM
	(107366)


	(GENERIC)
	icesvr memory size continually grows after each request from the
	web server.
	(107368)


	(GENERIC)
	Unecessary control locks taken on invalid table id 0 dduring
	referential constraint processing.
	(107371)


	(GENERIC)
	Server no longer crashes silently when performng a > 2K update
	against a DB created with a custom collation sequence.
	(107501)

        (WINDOWS-ONLY)
        The default value of Ingres character set should match the operating
	system's current ANSI code page.
