** Generic contents file for the Gateway release
** History
**	01-jul-1999 (matbe01)
**	    Created from release.ccpp.
**	23-apr-2001 (kinte01)
**	    Add VMS Gateways - Currently VMS uses gateways.ccpp instead
**	    of gwrelease.ccpp.  This change will merge the two files so
**	    we only have the one file.
**	14-feb-02 (chash01)
**	    Modify for Rdb
**	11-mar-2002 (mofja02)
**	    Added DB2UDB Gateway.
**	11-oct-2002 (mofja02)
**	    Ported to AIX.
**	22-apr-2004 (ahaal01)
**	    Added ESQL/C and ESQL/C++ packages.
**      11-nov-04 (mofja02)
**		Bug 113440
**              Removing informix, and sybase server classes.
**    10-Dec-2004 (clach04)
**            Added "Ingres client" software to gateway package.
**            This includes:
**                    JDBC (always there)
**                    ODBC (controlled by R_ODBC)
**                    (Open) API (always there)
**                    ESQL Precompilers (at least C/C++)
**                    Generic Error (GENERR) package/headers
**            Took code from Ingres manifest (release.ccpp).
**            NOTE 1: support for 64 bit targets is NOT present!
**            the precompiler code is taken verbatim but only
**            has partial 64 bit support.
**            NOTE 2: The code taken from release.ccpp does not 
**            include PREFER tags as these appear to be NEED
**            tags in disguise, e.g. "PREFER dbms" prevents ingbuild
**            from going past the customer install screen, pressing
**            menu items "Install" or "ExpressInstall" does
**            nothing and no errors are displayed.
**
**            OraclePackage, etc. have not been updated. I tested 
**            updating the visible package installs and it made no 
**            different to either Package installs or Customer installs.
**            ODBC is ifdef'd as in Ingres release.ccpp as ODBC is 
**            still not a package in the 2.6 codeline. ODBC will be
**            addressed in another change.
**
**            Changed NEED's to INCLUDE's for net package as this
**            caused conflicts with jdbc package.
**    04-Jan-2005 (clach04)
**            Added "PREFER net" for JDBC, this was incorrectly
**            omitted from the previous change. Prefer is required
**            to ensure that Net is setup before jdbc (the jdbc setup
**            scripts can not be ran on their own).
**    11-Jan-2005 (clach04)
**            Added jdbc and esqlc to OraclePackage and DB2UDBPackage
**    11-Oct-2005 (clach04)
**            Bug 115372
**            Added net and tm to OraclePackage and DB2UDBPackage
**            Replaced OraclePackage and DB2UDBPackage include of
**            esqlc with esql to include all precompilers.
**      12-dec-2007 (bolke01) bug 119604
**              Removed dependency on packdefs.h
**  28-May-2008 (wansh02/clach04)
**      Made EA 2.7 changes.
**      Removed VMS defs (not really supported any more).
**      ODBC driver is now included as a package rather than included in basic.
**      JDBC server is now called DAS, updated to use DAS.
**      Copied changes made to (Ingres) release.ccpp related 
**      to VISIBLE !CI_PER_USER_LICENSING versus INVISIBLE copied.
**      pl1 pre-compiler removed (like Ingres release.ccpp).
**      Added ODBC to Oracle and db2 packages (renamed jdbc to das).
**	22-Jun-2009 (kschendel) SIR 122138
**	    Hybrid add-on symbol changed, fix here.
