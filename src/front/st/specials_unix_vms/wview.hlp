WindowView

WindowView is an interface between Ingres and your windowing software
that provides mouse support in the UNIX and VMS environments.  With 
WindowView, you can use a mouse to move between fields, scroll tables and
forms, and select options from the menu line.  You can also run different
functions in different windows, and easily switch between them.
