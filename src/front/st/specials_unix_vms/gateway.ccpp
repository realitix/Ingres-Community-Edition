** History
**	26-Apr-99 (GordonW)
**		created.
**	11-May-99 (GordonW)
**		remove informix specific
**	07-Jun-99 (kinte01)
**		Update with VMS locations
**	08-Jun-99 (kinte01/chash01)
**		no iigwshut.exe for VMS. For VMS make iigwstop an
**		executable
**	17-Aug-99 (GordonW)
**		Added gwalias, gwsetlogin and gwsetschema.
**      25-jan-01 (chash01)
**              vms gateways do not have gwalias gwsetlogin gwsetschema
**      23-apr-2001 (chash01)
**              add gwalias and gwsetlogin, still no gwsetschema,
**              note gwalias and gwsetlogin on vms is in
**	21-may-2001 (kinte01)
**		Correct previous submission.  gwalias & gwsetlogin are
**		script files and not executables. 
**	12-oct-2001 (clach04)
**		Added MR release notes for non-VMS platforms
**	26-nov-2001 ( clach04)
**		Removed gateway mnx files from 2.5 Unix as they are 
**		no longer required (their existence actually causes problems).
**	24-may-2002 (kinte01)
**		Add iirungw executable for VMS only
**	16-Jun-2003 (ahaal01)
**		Added gateway mnx files for 2.5 hpb_us5 Unix as they are 
**		required.
**	12-May-2004 (ahaal01)
**		Added ingres!files!english!messages files: messages.readme
**		and messages.txt.
**		(Re-)Added gateway mnx error message files for ALL platforms.
**	21-May-2004 (clach04)
**		Removed 2.1/0106 release notes
**		Added readmes (text and html) as per new doc standard (i.e.
**		release notes are now called readmes and follow a naming 
**		standard).
**	04-Jan-2005 (clach04)
**              Removed gwalias.EX example file. Alias files are 
**              depreciated.
**	06-Jan-2005 (clach04)
**		Added EAversion.rel (like Windows). This is a version
**		file just like the Ingres version.rel.
**  28-May-2008 (clach04)
**      Removed unused/un-built (supposedly gateway) message.mnx files
**      s13.mnx, s202.mnx
**  02-Jun-2008 (clach04)
**      Removed VMS files.
**      Removed message directory "stuff" as this collides with fegeneric/basic.
**	20-Jan-2010 (hanje04)
**	    SIR 123296
**          Add support for LSB builds, server binaries live under
**          /usr/libexec/ingres, utilties and client binaries under /usr/bin,
**          libraries under /usr/lib/ingres and config under /usr/share/ingres

 Removed mnx files from 2.5 Unix as gateway messages
 are in the large (slow) mnx files - errhelp now works under 2.5
 Also under Solaris if these files exist all gateway error lookups FAIL

 ahaal01
 Added mnx files for 2.5 hpb_us5 Unix as gateway messages since they are
 still required

 clach04
 Re-added mnx files for ALL platforms. The previous decision to remove them
 was based on the fact that gateway messages had been in the fast and slow
 message files for Ingres, apparently it was a mistake that the gateway
 messages where in the fast and slow messages. Ingres (dbms and clients)
 no longer have gateway messages in the fast and slow message files.
