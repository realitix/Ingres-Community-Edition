** History
**	13-jul-1993 (dianeh)
**		Modified to generic.
**	30-jul-1993 (tyler)
**		Removed VERSION qualification from NEED specification
**		for STAR package.  Specification of version-based
**		dependencies needs to be rethought.
**	03-aug-1993 (tyler)
**		Added sharelib part to ingbasic package on VMS.
**	04-aug-1993 (tyler)
**		Added default VMS VOLUME specification.
**	05-aug-1993 (tyler)
**		Added PACKAGE declaration for VMS sharelib package.
**		Apparently the tools don't complain if an undefined
**		featurename is referenced.  This should probably be
**		fixed.
**	06-aug-1993 (tyler)
**		Removed defunct itm package which is now part of tm.
**	23-aug-1993 (dianeh)
**		Removed #ifdef around sigstar part file.
**	19-oct-1993 (tyler)
**		Removed hokey default VERSION specification which is
**		no longer necessary or supported.  Merged library.prt
**		into lib.prt.  Removed redundant installation package
**		and made the remaining installation package INVISIBLE.
**		Added DBMS Security Auditing package.
**	27-oct-1993 (kellyp)
**		Installation package should be VISIBLE for VMS.
**	29-oct-1993 (tyler)	
**		DBMS Security Auditing requires the DBMS to be installed.
**	02-nov-1993 (tyler)
**		Added NEED directive for the Star package (requires Net).
**		Added (new) PREFER directive for the Net package which 
**		causes the DBMS pacakge to get set up first when both
**		packages are installed.  Cleaned up format.
**	24-nov-1993 (tyler)
**		Added "DTP for TUXEDO" package for Unix and simplified 
**		embedded language package declarations.
**	24-nov-1993 (vijay)
**		Add R_TUXEDO ifdef's around the tuxedo package, in place of
**		ifdef unix.
**	05-jan-1994 (tyler)
**		Added Spatial Object Library package and updated installable
**		package names.  Merged febasic into pasic package.  Removed 
**		embedded text and eliminated FEATURENAME keyword. abf needs
**		to INCLUDE tm.
**	12-jan-1994 (tyler)
**		INCLUDE messages and frs in install package so that
**		ingbuild won't delete the support files it needs to run.
**		Reversed licensing model constraints for combined esql
**		and separate esql packages.  Removed charcomp package
**		which, according to Marketing, is identical to esql.
**		Moved tables.prt to qr_run.  Don't re-include tm in
**		userint package.  Don't include terminal monitors in
**		regular dbms or abf. 
**	13-jan-1994 (tomm)
**		Add ifdef for Ada.    If this is not there, any port which
**		does not support ada will not work.
**	14-jan-1994 (tyler)
**		Make the install package visible for VMS, since making
**		it INVISIBLE unexpectedly broke things.
**	24-jan-1994 (ricka)
**		removed parts embedded-pl1 and embedded-basic from being 
**		delivered by default on VMS.
**	03-feb-94 (vijay)
**		sharelib.prt is on unix too. Remove the vmslib package.
**	16-mar-94 (robf)
**		Update ES packaging.
**	28-Mar-1994 (fredv)
**	        Commented out the vigraph package for FCS1 per marketing
**		spec. Once marketing decides vigraph will be re-activated
**		or terminated in the future OpenINGRES releases. We will
**		do a permanant change to this file and probably CONFIG as
**		well.
**	5-apr-94 (vijay)
**		vigraph is back in for now.
**	13-apr-94 (vijay)
**		Put release notes in the basic package so that every
**		installation will get it.
**	12-apr-94 (arc)
**		'esqlcob', 'esqlfor' wview and vigraph should be shielded 
**		within appropriate #if statements - not unconditional.
**	25-apr-94 (teresal)
**		Add new package for ESQL/C++. Embedded C++ is not yet
**		available on VMS. ESQL/C++ uses the same executable as 
**		ESQL/C, so esqlcc requires (NEEDs) esqlc to already have been 
**		installed.
**	25-apr-94 (joplin)
**		Removed references to pascal, pl1, and basic embedded
**		precompiler parts.
**	27-apr-94 (tomm)
**		fix broken ifndef.  Needs the # before it.
**      15-feb-95 (lawst01) bugs (66052, 66890)
**              wview and vigraph will NOT be included in O.I. 1.1  
**      27-feb-95 (wolf)
**              Recently-added #if 0 flops on VMS.  Try #undef of the
**		relevant symbols.
**      04-apr-1995 (wolf) 
**              There's no secure version of INGRES on VMS for now, so skip
**		the whole package.
**	28-apr-95 (rajus01)
**		Added new part CA-OpenINGRES/API in basic PACKAGE.
**	15-may-95 (hanch04)
**		Added raat.prt to basic package
**	26-may-95 (hanch04)
**		Bug # 68974 Added sig!errhelp to basic PACKAGE
**	07-jun-95 (johna)
**		Added sig!ima to basic PACKAGE (as per hanch04)
**	08-jun-95 (hanch04)
**		removed PART api, should not be part of main code now.
**	24-Jul-95 (gordy)
**		Added PART api.
**	23-oct-95 (allst01)
**		Added PREFER secure to Ingres/Net since it
**		won't work on many secure boxes unless the
**		security has been set up.
**	09-Nov-95 (hanch04)
**		wview is back in the release.
**      10-Nov-95 (hanch04)
**              Products are now grouped together of easy choice install
**	17-nov-95 (hanch04)
**		Added web stuff.
**	21-nov-95 (hanch04)
**		Added vdba stuff.
**	08-dec-95 (hanch04)
**		Added terminal monitor to product packages.
**	13-dec-95 (hanch04)
**		Added oldmsg
**	09-feb-95 (albany)
**		Reexcluded SECURE on VMS for now.
**	18-mar-95 (albany)
**		Backout previous change; we now have SECURE on VMS.
**	18-jun-96 (harpa06)
**		Created Web package which will install with dbms and net
**		packages only. Bug #77137
**      05-Mar-96 (rajus01)
**              Added bridge stuff.
**      18-Apr-96 (rajus01)
**              Removed PART proto-bridge from net package. Now, it
**              is included as a separate package.
**	08-jul-96 (hanch04)
**		Web now a separate visible package, called ice.
**	02-oct-96 (rosga02)
**		Add target directory for OLDMSG
**      30-dec-96 (joea)
**              Add Replicator package.
**	30-dec-96 (rosga02)
**		Added pascal, pl1 for VMS AXP, and basic for VMS VAX 
**	03-feb-97 (boama01)
**		Bug 80057: package install just didn't work on VMS because
**		INSTALL part is not implicitly included for pkgs (as it is in
**		Unix INGBUILD). Had to explicitly INCLUDE it in all "Group"
**		pkgs (standalone, dbmsnet, etc.) for VMS.
**		  Also, with apologies to kellyp and tyler, INSTALL pkg should
**		be INVISIBLE on VMS! It will now disappear from the custom pkg
**		list, but will be implicitly included by KITINSTAL.COM logic.
**		  Also, added new part, KITINSTAL-MSGS, which replaces MESSAGES
**		part in INSTALL pkg for VMS, to keep out unneeded FRS files,
**		and thus saving 1945 blks of client install space.
**	19-feb-97 (boama01)
**		Bug 80559: added new AGGREGATE directive to CUSTOMINST pkg.
**		This allows its part capabilities to be OR-ed rather than
**		AND-ed, which lets the pkg be licensed if ANY part in it is.
**		See ip_licensed() in ipfile.sc for details.
**      17-nov-1997 (hanch04)
**              Made vdba a package.
**      17-nov-1997 (hanch04)
**              Modify vdba package.
**	26-nov-1997 (kinte01)
**		Remove vdba as a part of basic since it is now a package
**		Remove pro-bridge as a part since it has been replaced by
**		the package bridge. 
**      28-jan-1998 (hanch04)
**		Added ifdef FULL_RELEASE.  This will not be defined
**		for the black box release of Ingres.
**      29-Jan-1998 (rosga02)
**              Do not package SECURE for VMS unless it is Secure VMS
**              installation
**      29-jan-1998 (kinte01)
**              For VMS only: Add the SIG utility setuser back to the VMS
**              distribution. It used to be delivered with 6.4 but is no
**              longer delivered for OI and it has been requested often.
**	11-feb-1998 (kinte01)
**		Add some additional ifdef FULL_RELEASE's to work with 
**		rosga02 change from 29-jan
**	09-apr-1998 (canor01)
**		OpenINGRES becomes Ingres.

**              Add an ifndef VMS around the ICE package for 2.0 for now.
**	30-jun-1998 (hanch04)
**		Changed name from OpenINGRES to Ingres
**	25-mar-1998 (canor01)
**		Add gateways.
**	26-Aug-1998 (hanch04)
**		Moved vdba to rmcmd untill vdba exists on unix.
**	12-oct-1998 (toumi01)
**		Deliver shadow password support with the name server, not
**		as part of net, because it is also needed for ice.
**	05-nov-1998 (toumi01)
**		Do not require net for ICE (it is not needed and is not
**		even available for the free Linux version).
**	05-nov-1998 (toumi01)
**		Improve atomicity of package installation for the following,
**		because these need to be excluded from the free Linux version:
**		R_DBMSNET, R_DBMSSTAR, R_NETCLIENT, R_OLDMSG, R_NET,
**		R_BRIDGE, R_STAR, R_UADTSUP, R_OME, R_SPATIAL, R_RMCMD.
**	15-nov-1998 (dansa02)
**		Added R_OPENROAD ifdef sections.  (This is just an initial
**		proposal illustrating how OpenROAD might be incorporated into
**		the next full Ingres-II release.  It is certainly not final.)
**	19-Mar-1999 (kinte01)
**		For VMS only added an include of a new file packdefs.h that
**		will contain the defines for the packages that will be
**		installed on VMS. This change was made necessary by 438963
**		where the atomicity of package installation was improved.
**	22-mar-1999 (dansa02)
**		OpenROAD ordemo package has now been merged into ordev,
**		just like on Windows NT.
**	03-may-1999 (dansa02)
**		Restructured R_OPENROAD ifdef section to provide CustomInstall
**		components (ordev, orrun) as well as visible packages (ordevpkg,
**		orrunpkg).  Folded invisible ormw package into orrun.

**		is no longer needed anyway
**	22-Aug-2002 (hanje04)
