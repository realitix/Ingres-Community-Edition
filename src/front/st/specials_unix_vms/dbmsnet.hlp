Ingres Networked DBMS server
 
The Ingres Intelligent DBMS, the foundation of the Ingres
product line, provides the power to manage today's critical information
resources: data, knowledge, and objects.  Because of this unique
ability, the Ingres Intelligent DBMS empowers organizations to
model all aspects of their operations within the database engine
itself, rather than within client application code.
 
The Ingres Intelligent DBMS can support a wide range of
applications, from ad hoc queries to large-scale, mission-critical
production applications which require 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week
service.  The Ingres Intelligent DBMS features a threaded,
multi-server architecture which can fully harness the power of today's
scalable multiprocessors.  Other advanced features include the
industry's most advanced statistically based query optimizer, compiled
database procedures, on-line backup, and transparent two-phase commit.

The Ingres Networking extension enables communication between
Ingres installations in a heterogeneous, networked environment.
Ingres Networking supports several major protocols, including
TCP/IP and DECnet.
