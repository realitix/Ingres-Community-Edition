Ingres Object Management

Ingres Object Management is an extension to the Ingres
Intelligent DBMS which simplifies management and storage of complex
data types - such as graphical, time-series, or multi-currency data. 
The Ingres Object Management Extension (OME) allows the Ingres
DBMS server to be extended to support complex data types, by linking
in libraries which enable manipulation of complex data types using
standard SQL commands and operators.
