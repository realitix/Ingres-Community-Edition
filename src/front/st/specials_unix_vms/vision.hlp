Vision

Ingres Vision is the premier tool for rapid development of open, portable,
character-based applications.  Vision combines the productivity of a
4GL, the production power of a 3GL, an advanced user interface,
automatic code generation capabilities, and customizable code templates
which allow rapid development of applications that run against
relational and non-relational database systems from Actian Corporation, 
IBM, and Hewlett Packard.

Vision applications can be deployed both as traditional, host-based
terminal applications, or as client-server applications under Microsoft
Windows, Unix, and VMS.  When deployed under Microsoft Windows, Vision
applications support pull-down menus, button bars, and other mouse-driven
graphical user interface features.
