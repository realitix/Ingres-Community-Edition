# wgl_32s.hnt file for front\st\install
#
# History:
#	22-jan-07 (wridu01)
#		Created for front\st\install to keep mknmake away from
#		ipmain.sc.  Based on the review of the JAM MANIFEST this
#		file should not be processed on windows.  It is a UNIX
#		only file
#
#		There is no need to process ipbatch.c or ipfile.c either.
