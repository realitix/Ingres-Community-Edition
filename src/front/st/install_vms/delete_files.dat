! DELETE_FILES.DAT - VMS-only list of files to delete after installation.
!   The KITINSTAL.COM will parse this file and issue a VMI$CALLBACK DELETE_FILE
!   for each file listed.  This is done after the savesets are unloaded and
!   after the RENAMED.LST renamings are done, but before any IVPs are run.
!
!   Do NOT specify file versions; the DELETE_FILE callback will not accept
!   them; all versions are deleted.
!
! (Notice that comment lines beginning with "!" are ignored.)
