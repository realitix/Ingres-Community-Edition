	The Employee Tasks Assignments Frame demonstrates how 4GL is
	used to retrieve, manipulate, and update data in the database.
	The main initial menu operation, GetEmployee, queries the
	database based on values entered into fields on the form by
	the user and then displays a submenu of operations to
	manipulate the retrieved data.

	Once employee data has been retrieved, the operations available
	from the submenu are:

	    Next       - retrieves the next employee record.

	    DeleteEmp  - deletes an employee record.

	    RemoveTask - removes an assigned task from an employee.

	    UpdateEmp  - updates the database with all changes which
			 have been made to the employee information.
