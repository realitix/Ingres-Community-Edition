	The Employee Information Frame provides information about an
	employee and the employee's dependents.  The main initial
	menu operation, GetEmployee, queries the database based on
	values entered into fields on the form by the user and then
	displays a table field that lists the employee's dependents.
	If the employee has no dependents the table field is made
	invisible by this frame's 4GL code.

Menu Commands:

	GetEmployee       - retrieves employee and dependents from the
			    database.

	4GL		  - allows you to inspect the 4GL code for the
			    Employee Information Frame.

	End    		  - returns you to the preceding frame.

	Quit   		  - exits the Project Management application.
