/#-- vqescfld.hlp, help for the "Select the Field to Edit Escape code for"
/#-- popup in the escape code editor.
/#-- 
From this menu, you pick the field for which you want to edit escape code.  
Note that fields for a detail table all begin with 'iitf'.

There are two special field indicators on this menu: 'ALL' and 'iitf.ALL'.
'ALL' is a universal indicator that refers to all simple fields on the
form.  If you define escape code for 'ALL,' then it will be executed for
all simple fields.  If you define escape code for a specific simple field,
it will override whatever is defined for 'ALL.'  The 'iitf.ALL' symbol
refers to all the column in the table field.  If you define escape code for
a specific column in the table field, it will override whatever is defined 
for 'iitf.ALL'.

If escape code is currently present for a particular field, it is indicated 
by an asterisk in the right-hand column of this menu. The menuitems are:

  Select        Edit the escape code for the currently selected field.
  Cancel        Cancel the edit request.
  Help          Display this help text.
