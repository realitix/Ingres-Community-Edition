From this menu, you can either:
     1. Write the current source code to a file.  
     2. Read in the contents of a file to add to the source code.  
You will be prompted for the filename when you select a menuitem.  

The menuitems are:

  ReadFile      Reads in the contents of the specified file.
  WriteFile     Writes the entire source code block into the specified file.
  Help          Displays this help text.
  End           Returns back to the source code editor.

When you read a file, the contents of the specified file are read in directly
above the line where the cursor is positioned.  To read the file in at the
bottom of the source code block, position the cursor on the line below the
last line of the source code.
