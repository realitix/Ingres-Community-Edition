To make the system issue a unique, sequential number each time the user 
calls the form, you can specify an integer column in the Master table
as a sequenced field.  (For instance, you could use this to issue an
order number on an order entry form.)  These rules apply:

  * Only the Master table can have a sequenced field and you can sequence 
    only one field.

  * The column you specify as a sequenced field does not have to be displayed 
    as a field on the form.

To specify a sequenced field, type 'sequenced' in the "Assignment/Default" 
field next to the name of the column.
