The Application Flow Diagram displays information about an application. 
The application name is shown in the upper-left corner of the screen.

The Diagram provides the following information:

  * Each box represents a frame.  The name of the current frame is 
    highlighted. (Use MoreInfo to see frame names exceeding 13 characters.) 
  * The frame type is in brackets at the bottom right of the box.
  * Menuitem text above a box shows the menu choice from the parent frame.
  * The diagram displays the parent frame and up to four of the child frames 
    for the current frame.  Expansion indicators V, <, and > show you that 
    there are more child or peer frames.  Use the arrow keys to view them.
  * To change the current frame, use the arrow keys.
  * Indicators show the current status of a frame:
    - "New" appears on newly created frames.
    - "Changed" appears after you make changes to the frame.
    - "Error" appears if there is an error in the compiler or the visual 
       query.
