The Update Integrity Rule controls whether updates can be made to the join
columns if detail rows exist.  The selections are described below:

   CASCADE  - Any changes made to the join columns in the master will be 
	      propagated to the details.  

   RESTRICT - Changes are not allowed in the join columns.

   DBMS     - Vision assumes there are DBMS rules and procedures to handle 
	      the update of the detail row join column(s). This option does 
	      not create the DBMS rules and procedures, it only supports the 
	      existence of them by not generating code to update detail row 
	      join column(s).

Move the cursor to the desired option and choose "Select".
