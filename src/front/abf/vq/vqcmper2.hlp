This screen allows you to process the compilation errors in your application.
Errors for the current frame are displayed first, but you can access all the 
errors for your application.  This screen has two main parts:
  * A list of error summaries for the application is displayed at the top; 
    the list starts with the current frame.
  * Error output from compiling the current frame is displayed below.
To work on the current problem, choose the menuitem "FixError".  When you
finish, the error will be marked as fixed. To confirm that the errors for a 
frame have been corrected, choose the menuitem "Compile".

The menuitems are:
  MarkFixed     Indicate that the current problem is fixed.
  MarkUnfixed   Indicate that the current problem is still present.
  FixError      Edit the part of the frame definition that caused the error.
  Compile       Recompile the frame to see if the error(s) are corrected.
  ListingFile   Expand the listing display at the bottom to fill the screen.
  Help		Displays this help text.
  End		Returns to the previous screen.
