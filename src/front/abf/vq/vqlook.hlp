Use Lookup tables to validate a user's entries or to present the user with 
a list of valid entries for a field. To link a lookup table to a field in the 
Master or Detail table of your frame definition, use the AddTable menuitem.

The following rules apply:
  * Most lookup tables display as popup screens; very large lookup tables 
    display as full screens.

  * The user displays a lookup table by selecting ListChoices from the menu. 
    When the user selects a record from the lookup table, the system inserts 
    the value(s) into the form.

  * The user cannot perform operations directly on the lookup table (for 
    example, update or delete).

  * You can let the user enter a query restriction to narrow the range of data 
    the lookup table displays.  (For instance "ord*" would only display data 
    that starts with the letters "ord".)
