The default insert and delete settings allow users to:

  * Change records in the Master or Detail table, then save them as new 
    records without overwriting the original data.

  * Delete records from the Master or Detail table.  (All matching records in 
    the Detail table are deleted automatically when a record is deleted from 
    the Master table.)

If your frame uses both a Master and a Detail table, make sure the settings 
are consistent.  For example, if you do not allow deletions from the Master 
table, you should not allow deletions from the Detail table either.

To change the default settings, type an 'n' over the 'y' in the "Insert" or 
"Delete" field.
