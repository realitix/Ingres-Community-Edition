Use 4GL local procedures to avoid writing several pieces of escape code for
functions which need to be performed more than once in your frame; to make
the generated code easier to read; or to incorporate a 4GL procedure without
its own menuitem into your frame. A local procedure can be called only from
the source file in which it appears.

To use a local procedure, first Create it at the Edit Local Procedures screen;
this will enable you to declare your procedure and enter the source code.
Vision will insert the declaration and source code for the local procedure in
the generated source file.

You can use the value of the local procedure as follows:
  * In 4GL escape code
  * In an assigned value for a field on an Append frame
  * To pass to another frame as a parameter
