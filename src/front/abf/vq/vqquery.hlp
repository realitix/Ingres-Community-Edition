To control which records the user can retrieve, you can specify restrictions 
for as many columns in the Master or Detail tables as you like.  (For example, 
you can specify that the user may only retrieve records for items with more 
than 500 units in inventory.)

To restrict a query, enter a restriction consistent with the column's datatype 
in the "Query Restriction" field.  The restriction can have the form of any 
valid expression.  See Subtopics for information about valid expressions.
