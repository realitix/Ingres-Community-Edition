The Delete Integrity Rule controls whether the master row can be deleted 
if any detail rows exist. The selections are described below:  

  CASCADE -  Deleting the master will cause any details that exist to be 
	     deleted as well.  

  RESTRICT - The master cannot be deleted if any details exist.

  DBMS     - Vision assumes that there are DBMS rules and procedures to 
	     handle the deletion of detail rows. This option does not create 
	     the DBMS rules and procedures, it only supports the existence 
	     of them by not generating code to delete the detail rows.

Move the cursor to the desired option and choose "Select".
