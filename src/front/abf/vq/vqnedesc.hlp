/#-- menuitem and description when creating frames.
/#-- 
Menuitem descriptions should be kept short and to the point.  Keep in mind 
that the description you enter will be used in many places throughout your 
application, as listed below:

  * In the menu of the parent frame, next to the menuitem text.

  * In the help file of the parent frame.

  * At the top of the screen, whenever the frame itself is displayed.

  * As the title of the main help screen for the frame.

Although the entry field will hold up to 50 characters, you should probably 
make your menuitem description much shorter than that.
