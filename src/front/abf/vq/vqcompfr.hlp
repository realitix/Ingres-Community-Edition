You can compile a frame without running it in order to generate the code and
make sure that it compiles. You can also test a frame (by selecting 'Go'),
which both compiles and runs the frame.

  * When you Compile an area of the application, the system regenerates 
    any code and forms you have changed since the last time you compiled.

  * When you Test an area of the application, the system regenerates any 
    code and forms you have changed since the last time you compiled, 
    and then runs the application from the point of the current frame. 

To Compile or Test a frame and any frames below it, move the cursor to the 
frame and then select the appropriate operation from the menu.  If your 
cursor is on the top frame, the entire application will be compiled or 
tested.
