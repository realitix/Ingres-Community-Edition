For a Master table, you can set a default value that a field or local 
variable will be set to each time the form is cleared for new use.  
(For example, by specifying 'today' as the default value, you can make the 
system enter today's date in the "date" field each time the form is called.) 

The following rules apply:
  * You can set default values only for columns that represent a non-sequenced 
    column.
  * The value you set must be consistent with the column's datatype and can 
    take the form of any valid 4GL expression.  See Subtopics for information 
    about valid expressions.
  * If this is a writable field, users can change the default value by  
    typing over it.  To prevent this, use the forms editor to make the field 
    "display-only." 

To set a default value for a column, enter the default value across from the
column name in the "Assignment/Default field" of the Master table.
