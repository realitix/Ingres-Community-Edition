For each frame that needs to be changed in order to match the database, you
must accept or reject all the proposed changes. To help you decide what you 
want to do, you can look at both the before and after versions of the frame's
Visual Query.

OldVQ    Shows the frame's Visual Query as it is now, before you select OK to 
         accept the changes.

NewVQ    Shows the frame's Visual Query as it will be after you select OK to
         accept the changes.

When looking at either the old or the new Visual Query for a frame, you can 
see the current table definition by moving the cursor to that table, then 
selecting "TableDef."
