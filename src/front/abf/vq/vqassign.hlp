You can assign values to be inserted into database columns that are not 
displayed as fields on the form.

A database column to which you assign a value:

  * Can be in either the Master or Detail table.
  * Must be marked as 'not displayed' in the Visual Query.
  * Cannot be a sequenced field.

The value you assign must be consistent with the column's datatype and can 
take the form of any valid 4GL expression.  See Subtopics for information 
about valid expressions.

To assign a value to a database column, enter the value across from the 
column name in either the "Assignment/Default" field of a Master table or 
the "Assignment" field of a Detail table.
