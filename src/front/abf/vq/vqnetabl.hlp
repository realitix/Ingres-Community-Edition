You must enter a table name in the Master field.  The Detail table is 
optional.  You can enter any table you are authorized to use.

  * If you know the name of the table you want to use, just type it in 
    response to the prompt and select OK.

  * If you don't remember the exact table name or spelling: 
    - To display a list of all tables in the database, select ListChoices.  
    - To display a reduced list of tables, enter a query restriction in the
      Master or Detail field before you select ListChoices.  (For example, 
      to display only the table names beginning with "c," enter "c*".) 
    Once a list is displayed, move the cursor to a table name and select OK.

  * If you need to create a new table, select ListChoices and then select 
    Create.  The system call the Ingres Tables Utility.

For more information about Master and Detail tables, please refer to the 
"Using Ingres Through Forms and Menus" manual.
