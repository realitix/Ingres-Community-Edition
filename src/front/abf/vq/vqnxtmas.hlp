The Next Master Menuitem controls whether the Browse or Update frame expects 
to retrieve and handle more than one master row from the query. A "Next" 
menuitem is available or not available on the running frame accordingly.

If you expect that the query qualifications (restrictions) specified in the 
Visual Query and/or by the user will never retrieve more than one master 
during the query, then set the Next Master Menuitem to "No".  The "Next" 
menuitem will not be available on this frame as the application is run.

If you expect that multiple master rows will be returned from the query, 
then set the Next Master Menuitem to "Yes".  This will cause the "Next" 
menuitem to be available on this frame as the application is run.

Move the cursor to the desired option and choose "Select".
