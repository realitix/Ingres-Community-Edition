The Append-Start escape executes just before the INSERT query(ies) in:

     1)  Append frames 
     
     2)  Update frames that allow the insertion of new masters.

Example:

    To generate a new sequenced field value in an Update frame with Insert 
    allowed on the master table, where the master table key is a sequenced 
    field:

        sequence_key = CALLPROC sequence_value
            (table_name  = 'orders',
             column_name = 'order_no',
             increment   = 1,
             start_value = 1
            );
	COMMIT WORK;

    ("sequence_key" is the name of the field on the form that corresponds
    to the sequenced field in the database.)
