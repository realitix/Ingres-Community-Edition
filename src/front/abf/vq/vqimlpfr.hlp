You can import a frame when you want to create a frame that is based on an
existing frame in another Vision application.  The frame you import does
not have to be of the same type as the frame you are creating.

  * When you import a frame, the system copies the entire frame 
    definition, including the Visual Query and any escape codes you 
    may have defined.

  * Once you have imported a frame, you can edit the frame definition to 
    make this frame distinct from the original.

To select a frame to import, move the cursor to the frame name and press
Select.
