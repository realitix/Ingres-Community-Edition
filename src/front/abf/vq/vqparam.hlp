Passing parameters is a way of moving information from a parent to a child 
frame. Use this technique to be sure a user is working with the correct data 
and to save a user from having to re-enter data. The following rules apply:

  * Pass parameters only from Append, Browse, Update or Menu frames, between 
    variables or displayed fields, and from a parent to any number of its 
    child frames. (Specify the parameters separately for each child frame.)
  * The parameter you enter must be a local or global variable, a global
    constant, a field on the form, or a 4GL expression.
  * By default, Vision passes parameters by value; the value in the calling
    frame remains unchanged, regardless of the operation performed on the 
    data in the called frame.  To pass the parameter by reference, use the 
    4GL keyword 'byref' in the Parent Frame column.  For example, to pass 
    the field 'age' by reference, enter "byref(age)". Complex types like
    records and arrays are always passed by reference; do not use the keyword
    "byref" with them.
  * The value you pass must be current for the parent frame. If you remove 
    the value (for example, by clearing the form), it is not passed.
  * The order in which parameters are passed is only important if the child
    frame is a 3GL procedure.  In that case, the parameters must be passed in
    the order in which the 3GL source code declares them.

To specify a parameter, enter the value for the parent frame with the full 
4GL specification. For 4GL procedures only (this step doesn't apply to 3GL
procedures), press TAB and enter the name of the field on the child frame to 
which this value should be passed. Select End to save your changes.

The menuitems are:
 Insert         Insert a blank line above the current row of the table field.
 Delete         Delete the current row of the table field.
 Move           Move the current row of the table field to another position.
 Variables      Edit local or global variables.  You will see the local 
                variables either for the parent or child frame, depending on 
                which column of the table field you are currently in.
 ListChoices    Display a list of choices for parameter values.  You will see
                choices either for the parent or child frame, depending on
                which column of the table field you are currently in.
 Help           Access the Ingres Help facility.
 Cancel         Cancel any changes you have made and exit this frame.
 End            Keep any changes you have made and exit this frame.
