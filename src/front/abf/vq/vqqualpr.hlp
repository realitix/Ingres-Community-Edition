Qualification Processing controls whether the Browse or Update frame displays 
a blank screen to allow users to enter custom query qualifications (restric-
tions) before the query runs.  If user entered qualifications are present, 
they are added to the restrictions specified in the frame's Visual Query.

If you want to allow users to enter additional query qualifications 
(restrictions), then set the Qualification Processing to "Yes."  When the 
application is run, the user will be presented with a blank screen for 
entering additional query qualifications.  The user then selects the "Go" 
menuitem to begin the query.

If want to allow only the query qualifications (restrictions) placed in the 
Visual Query for this frame, then set the Qualification Processing to "No."  
When the application is run, the blank screen for entering additional 
qualifications will not appear - instead, the query will be executed as the 
frame is displayed and the data will be displayed immediately.

Move the cursor to the desired option and choose "Select".
