/#-- 
You are about to delete a join between two tables.  If this is the last
join between the two tables and you delete it, you will not be able to run 
this frame of the application until a join is re-established.  Use the 
"AddJoin" menuitem to create a new join between tables.

If you do not need a "Lookup" table any more, position your cursor on the 
Lookup table then choose the "DelTable" menuitem.

If you do not want to proceed with this operation, choose "Cancel".
