/#-- vqlpcols.hlp, help selecting an optimistic locking column
/#-- 
The selection list shows the names of columns you could use for optimistic
locking:
  * For an update counter, all integer columns are shown
  * For a date/time stamp, all date columns are shown
  * For a username, all char and varchar columns are shown

The column you choose should be used exclusively for optimistic locking; your
application should not attempt to store any other data in it.

Move the cursor to the column name and press Select.
