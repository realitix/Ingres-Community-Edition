Each form field and table field column can have an After-Field-Change 
escape.  The After-Field-Change escape executes when the cursor leaves a 
field or column, but only if the user typed a new value in that field.

Any After-Field-Exit escape defined on the field will execute after the
After-Field-Change escape. Also, for lookup join fields, the field value 
will be validated against the lookup table after the After-Field-Change 
escape runs.

After-Field-Change escape code examples:

    To control cursor movement to the next field:

        IF (priority = 'high') THEN
            RESUME FIELD remarks;
        ELSE
            RESUME NEXT;
        ENDIF;

    In an Update frame, to allow Lookup field values to be blanked out
    without causing a validation error:

        IF (cust_no = 0) THEN   /* User cleared the field */
            RESUME NEXT;        /* RESUME will branch out of the code and
                                ** skip over the lookup validation query
                                ** that follows. (see note on this below)
                                */
        ENDIF;

    (In an Append frame, Lookup fields CAN be left blank without causing
    a validation error, unless you make the field Mandatory in Vifred.)

Notes on the use of RESUME in After-Field-Change escapes: 

   1. If a field has a Lookup defined on it in the Visual Query, then 
      values entered in that field are validated against the lookup table. 
      However, that validation will NOT take place if the After-Field-Change 
      escape code issues a RESUME statement (or any of its variants, such as 
      "RESUME NEXT").  This is because RESUME statements cause a branch out 
      of the 4GL code and the Lookup validation follows the After-Field-
      Escape.  Also, if the value entered in the field is valid (i.e., it 
      exists in the lookup table), then a RESUME NEXT will be issued 
      automatically following the validation.

   2. If both an After-Field-Change escape and an After-Field-Exit escape 
      exist for the same field, they are both placed in the same activate 
      block in the generated file. If the After-Field-Change escape issues 
      any type of RESUME statement, the After-Field-Exit escape will not 
      execute (because RESUME causes a branch out of the 4GL code).
