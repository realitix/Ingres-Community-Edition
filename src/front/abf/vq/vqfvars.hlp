/#-- parameter passing editor.
/#-- 
From this menu you can pick the type of component that will serve as the
source or destination for parameter passing.  If the cursor is on the left 
side of the screen, then the choices are for the parent (source) frame.  If 
the cursor is on the right side of the screen, then the choices are for the 
current (destination) frame.  The component type choices are:

  Form Fields           Names of fields in the parent or current frame.
  Local Variables       Names of declared local variables in the parent
                        or current frame.
  Global Variables      Names of declared global variables.
  Global Constants      Names of declared global constants (not available
                        as an option for the destination).

When you choose an item from the list, it will replace whatever is on the
screen for the parameter expression. The menuitems are: 
  Select        Choose the current component type.
  Cancel        Cancel the ListChoices request.
  Help          Display this help text.
