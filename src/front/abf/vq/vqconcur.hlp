This frame behavior is only an issue if more than one user will be using the
application at the same time.

When Locks Held on Displayed Data is set to "None", the locks are released
immediately after the data is retrieved.  When set to "Dbms", the locks are
held until after the user has finished updating the data, and the data cannot
be accessed by anyone else until the locks are released. When set to
"Optimistic", no locks are held, but a user cannot save a record (the change
will be lost) if another user has updated it since the first user retrieved
the record from the database.

General guidelines for setting this behavior are as follows:
  * Select "None" if only one user will update the data at a time, while 
    other users will only display the data and won't mind if the data 
    might be out of date.
  * Select "Dbms" if you do not want any user to see data that might be out
    of date because a second user has updated it while the first user is
    still displaying it.
  * Select "Optimistic" if more than one person might try to update the same
    data at the same time.

Enter the frame behavior setting, or select ListChoices for a selection list.
The "Column Type" table field is ignored unless the behavior is set to
Optimistic.
