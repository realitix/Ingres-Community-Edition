Use local variables to hold information the user won't see.  Local variables 
apply on a per-frame basis; globals apply throughout the application.

To use a local variable, first Create it at the Edit Local Variables screen.
Vision assigns an initial value of blanks for character datatypes and zeroes 
for numeric datatypes. (You can use a previously defined record type as a 
datatype when you create a local variable.) Depending on how you want to 
use the local variable, you might want to change the initial value. Do this 
by including a 4GL assignment statement in the escape code or by editing the 
source code. 

To retrieve the value of the variable, you must write 4GL escape code.  You 
can use the value of the variable as follows:
  * In a query restriction on a Browse or Update frame
  * In an assigned value for a field on an Append frame
  * To pass to another frame as a parameter
  * To display to the user through 4GL escape code (for example, as part of 
    a message)
