You must assign one or more table columns to be used for optimistic locking.
The following combinations work best:

  * An update counter, incremented each time the row is updated
  * A date/time stamp column, showing when the row was last updated
  * A date/time stamp column and a username column, showing the name of the
    user who last updated the row

Optimistic locking works by checking the values of these column(s) when a
user tries to save a record. If the value has changed since the user
retrieved the record from the database, this means that someone else has
updated the record, and the save will not be performed.

Optimistic locking columns will usually be in the master table only, though
you can use detail columns as well (or instead). The column you use must have
the correct datatype: integer for an update counter, date for a date/time
stamp, and varchar for a username.

Enter the column name next to the column type you have chosen, or select
ListChoices for a list of columns of the right datatype.
