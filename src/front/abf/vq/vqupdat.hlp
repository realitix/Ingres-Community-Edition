Update frames let the user retrieve records from tables and then update the 
retrieved data.  The default settings (which you can change) allow the user 
to:

  * Insert Detail table records.
  * Delete Detail table records when the corresponding Master table record 
    is deleted.

By specifying a query restriction, you can control which records the user 
may retrieve.  You can also specify the sort order for retrieved records.
 
Select Subtopics from the menu to see more information about each of these 
features.
