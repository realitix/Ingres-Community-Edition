A record combines related kinds of data (attributes) so that the application 
can treat them as one value (for instance, columns named street, city, state, 
and zip code might be attributes of a record called "address"). Record 
attributes can be of three types:
  * An Ingres datatype
  * An array
  * Another, separately defined record

When you create a local variable, you must specify:
  * The names of the form, table, and/or table fields you are using
  * Whether the record is an array

To specify a record in a local variable definition, the record does not have
to be created yet. However, you will not actually be able to use the record 
until you create it. To Create the record, select Global Objects, Record 
Types, then Create, in that order from the Edit Local Variables screen.

For more details, see Help for Creating and Editing record type definitions.
