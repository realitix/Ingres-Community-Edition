Each form field and table field column can have a After-Field-Exit escape.
The After-Field-Exit escape executes when the cursor leaves a field
or column.

Any After-Field-Change escape defined on the field will execute before the 
After-Field-Exit escape. Also, for lookup join fields, the value in the 
field will be validated against the lookup table before the After-Field-Exit 
escape runs.

After-Field-Exit escape code example:

    To control cursor movement to the next field:

        IF (priority = 'high') THEN
            RESUME FIELD remarks;
        ELSE
            RESUME NEXT;
        ENDIF;
