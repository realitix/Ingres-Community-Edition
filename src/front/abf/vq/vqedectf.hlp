Overview of Escape Code (select menuitem "Subtopics" for details).
                                                                  
  (NOTE -- General information about escape code is provided below the 
   following description of Menu Items.  Simply scroll down the pages.)

Menu Items
----------
     Edit        Puts you in the system text editor. You can use the editor
                 to enter your escape code.

     File        Displays the ReadFile and WriteFile menuitems, which you can 
                 use to read from an existing file or write your escape code
                 out to a file.

     Blank       Clears the escape code window. Will ask if you want to save 
                 your changes or not.

     LineEdit    Allows you to move text in the escape code window. You can 
                 insert, delete, split, or join lines.

     Variables   Displays the Local/Global Components Menu. On this menu, you
                 select a category: Local Variables, Global Variables, Global
                 Constants, or Record Types. Vision displays an input form
                 for the category you choose.

     Save        Saves your changes to the database without leaving the
                 screen. If you used ReadFile, changes are not saved to
                 the file.

You can write escape code to:

   * Display messages or prompts when a user calls a frame, enters a field, or
     selects a menuitem.
   * Keep track of how many records are retrieved, updated, or appended, on a
     frame.
   * Set "if-then" conditions for calling frames or taking other actions.
   * Assign an initial value to a global or local variable.

You can use any 4GL statements in your escape code, subject to the restric-
tions discussed in the "Subtopics" for this Help screen. Your code must
follow the standard 4GL syntax, with multiple statements separated by a
semicolon. (See the "Subtopics" for examples of 4GL code and the "Ingres 4GL
Reference Manual" for instructions on writing 4GL code.)

The escape code type specifies at what point your escape code will be 
activated when Vision runs the frame.
