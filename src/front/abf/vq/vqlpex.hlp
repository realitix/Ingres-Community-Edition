The following simple examples show the basic pattern for writing local
procedures. See the sample application in the Ingres/4GL Reference Manual 
for more complex examples.

1. Local procedure to add the tax to the cost of an order. Procedure was 
   created with a return type of FLOAT.

Code to call the procedure:
    total_cost = addtax (cost = costfield, tax = taxpercent);

Local procedure source code:
    PROCEDURE addtax (cost = FLOAT, tax = FLOAT) =
    DECLARE
	tot = FLOAT;
    BEGIN
	tot = cost + (cost * tax);
	RETURN tot;
    END

2. Local procedure to display a goodbye message. Procedure was created with a
   return type of NONE.

Form-End escape code to call the procedure:
    CALLPROC goodbye();

Local procedure source code:
    PROCEDURE goodbye() =
    BEGIN
	MESSAGE 'Leaving the phone_orders application....goodbye!';
	SLEEP 2;
    END
