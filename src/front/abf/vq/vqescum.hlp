The Table-Field-Menuitems (previously called User-Menuitem) escape is used in
ListChoices-style Menu frames.  You can add additional choices to the
tablefield in your Form-Start escape code.  If the user Selects one, no child
frame will match it, so your User-Menuitem escape code will be called with the
variable 'IIchoice' set to the user's choice.  This escape code can take the
appropriate action, based on the value of 'IIchoice'.  It should set
'IIfound' to 1, so that the user won't be told that their choice was
unrecognized.

Example:

    In Form-Start:

        /* Put a new command into the table field */
        LOADTABLE iitf 
                (command = 'Message', explanation = 'Display message');

    In Table-Field-Menuitems:

        /* Check for the 'Message' command */
        IF IIchoice = 'Message' THEN
            MESSAGE 'You have chosen the ''Message'' command.'
            WITH STYLE = POPUP;
            IIfound = 1;
        ENDIF
