You can specify the following aspects of the Lookup table and form display:

  * The columns you want to display in the Lookup pop-up (default is none) 
    and the order you want to display them in.
    - To use the Lookup table for validating a user's entries, leave the 
      "Order" columns blank.  The Lookup pop-up will not be displayed.
    - To display one column on the Lookup pop-up, enter a "1" in the "Order" 
      column next to the column name.  
    - To display more than one column in the Lookup pop-up, specify the 
      sequence by entering the appropriate numbers in the "Order" column.
  * The column titles you want to display in the Lookup pop-up.
    - With the column name highlighted, tab to the "Column Title" column
      and enter a new title.
  * The columns you want to display on the form.  
    - To display the column on the form, enter a "y" in the "Display" field.  
    - To create a local variable based on the column without displaying it on
      the form, enter a "v" in the "Display" field. You can then use this
      local variable when creating escape code.
    - Columns can be displayed on the form without being displayed in  
      the Lookup pop-up and vice versa.
