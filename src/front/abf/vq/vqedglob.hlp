/#-- would like to edit: Variables, Constants, or Record Type Definitions.
/#-- 
Move the cursor to the component type of your choice, then Select it.

  * Variables:  Global variables apply throughout the application (local 
    variables are defined for each frame or procedure individually).  Use
    them for collecting and storing global state information used by frames.
    Do not use them for passing parameter information between frames.

  * Constants:  Use global constants for values that appear at various points 
    throughout your application.  When you need to change the value, you only 
    change it in the definition; the system displays and uses the new value
    wherever it appears.

  * Record Type Definitions:  Use records to collect related kinds of data and
    then treat the grouped data as a single value.  Record attributes can be
    Ingres datatypes, other records, or dynamic arrays of records.
