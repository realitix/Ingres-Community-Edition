Types of escape code (select menuitem "SubTopics" for details):

    Escape Name         Description
    ------------------  ------------------------
    Form-Start          Runs before form is displayed.
    Form-End            Runs before RETURNing from the frame.

    Query-Start         Runs before the SELECT in Update and Browse frames.
    Query-New-Data      Runs each time new data is put on the form (for
                        example, after a "Go" or "Next" menuitem is selected).
                        Update and Browse frames only.
    Query-End           Runs after the query is finished and the user has 
			finished working with the Selected data. Update and 
			Browse frames only.

    Append-Start        Runs before INSERT statement(s) in the "Save"
                        menuitem of Append frames or the "AddNew"
                        menuitem of Update frames that allow Inserting
                        master data.
    Append-End          Runs after INSERT statement(s) and before the
                        COMMIT WORK in the "Save" menuitem of Append frames
                        and "AddNew" menuitem of Update frames that allow
                        Inserting master data.

    Update-Start        Runs before the UPDATE statement(s) in Update frames.
    Update-End          Runs after the UPDATE statement(s) and before
                        the COMMIT WORK in Update frames.

    Delete-Start        Runs before the DELETE statement(s) in Update frames.
    Delete-End          Runs after the DELETE statement(s) and before
                        the COMMIT WORK in Update frames.

    Menu-Start          Runs before the CALLFRAME/CALLPROC statement in
                        a user-defined menuitem.
    Menu-End            Runs after the called frame or procedure returns
                        in a user-defined menuitem.

    Before-Field-Entry  Runs as the cursor enters a field.
    After-Field-Change  Runs when the cursor leaves a field, but only if
                        the user has typed a value in the field.
    After-Field-Exit    Runs when the cursor leaves a field, whether the
                        value in the field has changed or not.

    Before-Lookup	Runs before the CALLFRAME look_up() in the
                        "ListChoices" menuitem
    After-Lookup	Runs after the CALLFRAME look_up() in the
                        "ListChoices" menuitem

    Table-Field-Menuitems  Runs in a ListChoices-style Menu frame when the
			   user's choice isn't a child frame.
    Menuline-Menuitems  Runs after user-defined menuitems.

    On-Timeout          Runs when the default timeout period has elapsed.
    On-Dbevent		Runs when a registered database event is raised.

Escape code can contain any valid 4GL statement, with the following
exceptions:

   1. RESUME statements (and the RESUME statement variants: RESUME FIELD 
      and RESUME NEXT) should only be issued in "Query-New-Data," 
      "Before-Field-Entry," and "After-Field-Exit" escapes. This is because 
      the RESUME statement effectively branches control out of the 4gl 
      operation; any 4GL statements in the operation following the RESUME 
      are skipped. The three escapes listed above are the only ones not 
      followed by additional 4GL statements.

      However, there may be cases where you want to skip the 4GL statements 
      following an escape. For example, if an "Update-Start" escape code 
      segment detects an error in what the user entered on the screen, you 
      could have it skip the subsequent database update statements. In these 
      cases, it is okay to issue a RESUME statement, but it is still a good 
      idea to Edit the source code and review which 4gl statements will be 
      skipped.

   2. Escape code should not contain activate blocks, such as Menuitems
      or Field Activates (although SUBMENUs and queries with attached
      menus are okay.)
