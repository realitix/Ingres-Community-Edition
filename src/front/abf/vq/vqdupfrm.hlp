/#-- you see when duplicating a frame.

When you duplicate or import a frame, you may also duplicate its form.
Vision will create a form for your new frame which is an exact copy of the
existing frame's form.

  * Select "Yes" to duplicate the form of the frame you are duplicating

  * Select "No" to have Vision create a default form.

Move the cursor to the desired option and choose "Select"; or choose "Cancel"
to cancel the duplicate or import operation.
