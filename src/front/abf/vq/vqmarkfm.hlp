/#-- vqmarkfm.hlp, help on marking frames to be reconciled by the 
/#-- Reconcile utility.
/#-- 
The Reconcile utility allows you to adjust a frame's Visual Query, when the 
table referenced by the frame has changed.

The list includes all the frames in your application with Visual Queries, 
even those Removed from the Application Flow Diagram. You can keep a frame 
from being reconciled by changing its setting to 'n' before you select OK.

The Reconcile utility reports on the reconciliation as it occurs. During 
reconciliation, when a given frame needs to be changed to match the database, 
you can accept or reject the changes for the frame; you cannot accept 
some and reject others.

To help you make a decision, you can view the Visual Query for the frame 
as it is and as it will be if you accept the changes. You can also Cancel 
the changes, then write the report to a file; this is especially convenient 
if you want to examine the proposed changes before you decide.
 
To reconcile a set of frames, change the setting to 'n' for any frames you 
want to exclude and then select OK.
