You can duplicate a frame when you want to create a frame that is based on 
an existing frame.  For example, this is a good method to use when you want 
to create a frame like one you already have, but of a different type. The
following rules apply:

  * When you duplicate a frame, the system copies the entire frame 
    definition, including the Visual Query and any escape codes you 
    may have defined.

  * Once you have duplicated a frame, you can edit the frame definition to 
    make this frame distinct from the original.

To duplicate a frame, move the cursor to the frame name and choose Select.
