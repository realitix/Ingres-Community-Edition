/#-- 
You can insert any frame in the list; all frames in the application are 
listed. The following rules apply:

  * When you insert a frame, you also insert all the frames below it in 
    its tree.

  * Because a frame cannot call itself, the frame you insert cannot already 
    appear in the Application Flow Diagram above the point where you want 
    to insert it.

To insert an existing frame, move the cursor to the frame in the list and 
choose Select.

To insert a new frame, select Cancel and then Create a new frame.
