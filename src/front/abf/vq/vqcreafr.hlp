Before you create a frame, decide on the structure of the application you are 
developing.  Plan the "family" relationship of frames to each other, the 
names of the frames, and the tables you will use.  To Create a frame: 
  * Select Create from the menu.
  * At the prompt, specify placement of the frame.
  * Select the frame type from a popup list.
  * Name the frame and specify the tables it will use.

Instead of creating a new frames, you can insert an existing frame. When you 
insert a frame, you also insert all the frames below it in its tree.  Because 
a frame cannot call itself, the frame you insert cannot already appear in the 
Application Flow Diagram above the point where you want to insert it. To 
Insert a frame:
  * Select Insert from the menu.
  * At the prompt, specify placement of the frame.
  * Select the frame you want to insert from the list of existing frames.
  * Name the frame.
