Changing the menuitem text does not change the frame name, which is based 
on the original menuitem text.  To change the frame name, select MoreInfo
from the Application Flow Diagram, then choose Rename.  

The menuitem text:

  * Must be no longer than 32 characters.
  * Can contain any combination of alphanumeric and special characters.  
    (Only the special characters  _  #  $  @  carry over into the frame name;
    other special characters are dropped out.)
  * Appears in upper and lower case as you enter it.
  * Can contain blanks, but this might confuse a user into thinking it is 
    more than one menuitem.
  * Must be unique among the frame's peers, but can be the same as menuitem 
    text for frames at other levels.  The system appends a sequence number 
    to create unique frames if necessary.
