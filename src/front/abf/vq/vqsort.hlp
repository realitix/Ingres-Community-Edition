The system retrieves records from the database in the order the columns 
appear in the table.  (For example, if "customer number" is the first column 
in a table, records are retrieved in order by customer number.)

  * To specify a different sort order, move the cursor to the name of the 
    column by which you want the records sorted.  Tab to the first "Sort" 
    column and enter the number '1'.  Tab to the second "Sort" column and 
    specify ascending (smallest to largest or "a" to "z") or descending order 
    by entering an 'a' or a 'd'.

  * Repeat these steps for each additional column on which you want to sort, 
    entering the appropriate number and the ascending/descending indicator.
