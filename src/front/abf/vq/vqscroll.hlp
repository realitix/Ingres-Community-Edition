You are at the Visual Query Editor screen in the normal display form, which
shows the details of a query definition.  You can choose Zoomout from the 
menu to see the "compressed display" and then choose End to see the normal, 
detailed display again.  

To move around the Visual Query Editor:

  * Use the up and down arrow keys to scroll between rows in a table field.

  * Use TAB to move to the next column in a row, to the next simple field, 
    or to the next table from the last column in any row of a table field.

  * Use Control-P to move back to the previous column in a row, to the 
    previous simple field, or to the previous table field from the first 
    column of any row in a table field.
