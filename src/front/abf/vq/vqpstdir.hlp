The system is asking you where, in relation to the current frame, you want 
to insert the frame.  (The current frame is the one your cursor was on when 
you selected Insert.)

  * To insert the frame as a peer frame, select Right or Left.

  * To insert the frame as a child frame, select Down if there are no other 
    child frames.  If other child frames already exist, you must place the
    frame as the peer of one of them. To do this:
    - Select Cancel.
    - Move the cursor to one of the child frames.
    - Select Insert.
    - Select Right or Left.

  * To select a different current frame, use Cancel to end this operation,
    then move the cursor to the desired frame and select Insert again.
