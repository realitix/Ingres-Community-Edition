Removing a frame is different from Destroying a frame. 

  * When you Remove a frame, it is not destroyed.  
    - The menuitem that calls the frame is deleted from the parent frame.
    - Lower-level frames in the family are removed along with the frame.
    - All the removed frames can be inserted again later.

  * When you Destroy a frame, it is deleted from the application. You cannot 
    insert it again later.  
    - Lower-level frames in the family are removed but not destroyed.  Since 
      they are not destroyed, they are available and can be inserted again 
      later.
