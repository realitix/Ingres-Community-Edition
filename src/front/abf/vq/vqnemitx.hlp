/#-- menuitem and description when creating frames.
/#--  
The system uses the first 12 legal characters in the menuitem text to name 
the frame.  The menuitem text:

  * Must be no longer than 32 characters.
  * Can contain any combination of alphanumeric and special characters.  
    (Only the special characters  _  #  $  @  carry over into the frame 
    name; other special characters are dropped out.)
  * Appears in upper and lower case as you enter it.
  * Can contain blanks, but make sure it doesn't look like two menuitems.
  * Must be unique among the frame's peers, but can be the same as menuitem 
    text for frames at other levels.  The system appends a sequence number 
    to create unique frame names if necessary.
  * Can be changed later by using the Edit operation from the Application 
    Flow Diagram menu.
