By default, when the user calls a Lookup table, the system displays all the 
records in the table.  However, you can let the user "qualify" (restrict) 
the query so that only certain Lookup table records are displayed.  

The default is to NOT allow user qualifications.  If you want to let the 
user enter qualifications, move the cursor to the "Qualification (y/n)" 
field and type a "y" over the "n."
