/#-- vqinsdir.hlp, behind the popup that asks for direction to place a newly 
/#-- created frame.
The system is asking you where, in relation to the current frame, you want to 
place the new frame. (The current frame is the one your cursor was on when 
you selected Create.)

  * To place the new frame as a peer frame, select Right or Left.

  * To place the new frame as a child frame, select Down if there are no 
    other child frames.  If other child frames already exist, you must place 
    the new frame as the peer of one of them. To do this:
    - Cancel this operation.
    - Move the cursor to one of the child frames.
    - Select Create.
    - Select Right or Left.
    (Note:  The 'Down' menuitem is only available for the Append, Update, 
     Browse, and Menu frame types.)
	   
  * To select a different current frame, use Cancel to end this operation, 
    then move the cursor to the desired frame and select Create again.
