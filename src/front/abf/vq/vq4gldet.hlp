For frames with a table field on the form, the table field name is:

        iitf

Two temporary INTEGER variables are available for your use in escape code:

        IIint
        IIint2  (not available in Menu frames)

    'IIint' and 'IIint2' are for temporary use only -- their values may
    change after your escape code executes (these temporary variables
    are also used by the generated 4gl code). Also, because 'IIint' and
    'IIint2' are used elsewhere in the generated 4gl, their initial values 
    are undefined.

IIretval is a built-in global variable used to return status information
from child to parent frames.

        IIretval
        Value    Meaning
        -------- ------------------------------
         1       Normal return
         2       User pressed TopFrame menuitem
        -1       Error occurred in child frame

If you want to exit from a Browse or Update frame with Query 
Qualification Disabled, but you want to run any "QUERY-END" and "FORM-END"
escapes first, do the following in your escape code:

        ENDLOOP IIloop;

    You can issue this statement from any escape code, except FORM-START
    and QUERY-START.

If you do NOT want to clear all fields after each Save in an Append
frame and after each AddNew in an Update frame, add the following
statement to the frame's Form-Start Escape:

        IIclear = 'n';

        (In an Update frame, this statement should only be used when the
        Visual Query specifies that master Inserts are allowed.)

If you do NOT want to clear all fields in an Update or Browse frame
after running the Select query (before returning back to Query mode),
add the following statement to the frame's Form-Start Escape:

        IIclear2 = 'n';

        (This statement should only be used in Update and Browse
        frames where the 'Query Qualification' frame behavior is set
        to 'Enabled'.)

In ListChoices-style Menu frames, IIchoice is the command which the user
Selects.  IIfound is set to 1 if this command is a child frame, and to 0
otherwise.  If IIfound is 0, the User-Menuitem escape code is called to
execute the command.
