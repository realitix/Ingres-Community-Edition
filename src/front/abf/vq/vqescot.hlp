On-Timeout escape code runs when timeout occurs. The default timeout period is 
300 seconds. You can change this default for the whole application, by editing
the template file intopdef.tf and changing the value of the substitution
variable $_timeout_seconds; or you can change the default for an individual
frame by writing form-start escape code which resets the timeout.

Vision generates code which sets the timeout period, and the beginning and end
of the timeout activation block; you do not have to enter an ON TIMEOUT
statement, or BEGIN and END statements around your code block.

A frame which does not have any On-Timeout escape code will have a timeout
period of 0; it will not inherit its parent's timeout period.

Example:
    On-Timeout escape code to clear the screen; any user input followed by
    RETURN reactivates the screen.

    CLEAR SCREEN;
    SET_FORMS FRS (TIMEOUT = 0);
    USER_INP = PROMPT 'Hit RETURN to continue....';
    SET_FORMS FRS (TIMEOUT = $_timeout_seconds);
    REDISPLAY;
