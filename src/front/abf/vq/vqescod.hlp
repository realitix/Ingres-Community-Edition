On-Dbevent escape code runs when a registered database event is raised.

To use a database event, you must CREATE it in the DBMS server, and RAISE it
in the sending application. See the Ingres/4GL Reference manual for details
of database event handling.

Vision generates the beginning and end of the activation block; you do not
have to enter an ON DBEVENT statement, or BEGIN and END statements around
your code block. You must also add a REGISTER DBEVENT statement, probably as
Form-Start escape code, to register the event.

Example: On-Dbevent code to order parts when the "part_low" event is raised.

In Form-Start escape code:
	/* Register the event */
	REGISTER DB_EVENT part_low;

In On-Timeout escape code:
	/* Retrieve information about the event which has been raised */
	INQUIRE_INGRES (ename = DBEVENTNAME, etime = DBEVENTTIME);
	IF ename = 'part_low' THEN
		CALLPROC part_order;
	ENDIF;
