Columns that share the same name and datatype are considered "natural" joins, 
even though they might contain different information (for instance, a 
building address in a Master table and an employee address in a Detail table).

  * Master and Detail tables are joined on EACH natural join.  Join columns 
    in the Detail table are not displayed as fields on the form.  
    - If your Master and Detail tables have more than one join, decide which 
      join you want to keep.  Use DelJoin to delete the joins you want to 
      display as fields on the form.  
    - You must leave at least one join in place.
    - To add a join, use AddJoin and then specify the columns you want to 
      join.

  * Lookup tables are joined to their associated Master or Detail table on 
    the FIRST natural join.  
    - To change the join:
          1. Use DelJoin to delete the default join.
	  2. Use AddJoin to specify the new join.
