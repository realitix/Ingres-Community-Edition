You are about to change this frame in such a way that Vision will need 
to regenerate the 4GL code. However, the 4GL source code for this frame 
has been edited directly and contains changes that Vision does not know 
about.  

Normally, Vision regenerates the 4GL source code automatically whenever 
it needs to, but regenerating this frame would overwrite custom editing 
to the 4GL code. In this case, Vision does not regenerate automatically. 
You can proceed with the current changes, but in order to see these 
changes in the running application you must force Vision to regenerate 
the 4GL code by selecting the "Compile" menuitem for this frame.

You may want to make a copy of the 4GL source code file before selecting
the "Compile" menuitem so that you can copy your customizations back into
the newly generated code. Use the system editor for copying.

If you do not want to proceed with the edit operation, choose "Cancel".
