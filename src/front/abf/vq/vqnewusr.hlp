Vision is an Ingres tool for developing applications that work with 
Ingres databases.  You use it to create the forms and menus that allow 
application users to access the information in the database.

You don't need to know any programming languages to use Vision.  You use 
the Vision screens to design and build the application, then Vision 
generates the instructions that tell Ingres how to run your application.

It is best to read the introductory chapters in the Forms-based Application
Development Tools User Guide before you start working with the system.
