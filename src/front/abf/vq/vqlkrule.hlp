The following rules apply when you include Lookup tables in your Visual Query:

  * You can use Lookup tables with Append, Browse, or Update frames.

  * The column that activates the Lookup table must be displayed as a
    field on the form.

  * You can include Lookup tables for any number of displayed columns in 
    the Master and Detail tables.

  * The Lookup table must share at least one join column with the table for 
    which you specify it.  This join column does not have to be the same 
    column that activates the lookup.
