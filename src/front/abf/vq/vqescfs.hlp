The Form-Start escape executes after the frame starts, but before the form 
is displayed.

Examples:

    To SELECT information to hidden fields (h_name, h_status):

        formname := SELECT h_name = e.name, h_status = e.status
        FROM employees e
        WHERE e.empno = :empno ;

    If you do NOT want to clear all fields after each Save in an Append
    frame and after each AddNew in an Update frame, add the following
    statement to the frame's Form-Start Escape:

        IIclear = 'n';

        (In an Update frame, this statement should only be used when the
        Visual Query specifies that master Inserts are allowed.)

    If you do NOT want to clear all fields in an Update or Browse frame
    after running the Select query (before returning back to Query mode),
    add the following statement to the frame's Form-Start Escape:

        IIclear2 = 'n';

        (This statement should only be used in Update and Browse
        frames where the 'Query Qualification' frame behavior is set
        to 'Enabled'.)

    To force the form to be displayed:
        
        REDISPLAY;

    To change attributes of a field or column:

        SET_FORMS FIELD '' (DISPLAYONLY(empno) = 1, INVISIBLE(salary) = 1);
        SET_FORMS COLUMN '' 'iitf' (DISPLAYONLY(empno) = 1,
                                    INVISIBLE(salary) = 1);
    To change FRS runtime behavior:

        SET_FORMS FRS (ACTIVATE(MENUITEM) = 1, VALIDATE(PREVIOUSFIELD) = 1);
        SET_FORMS FRS (TIMEOUT = 30);

    To set the form information:

        SET_FORMS FORM (CHANGE = 1);
        SET_FORMS FORM (MODE = 'READ'); /* FILL, UPDATE, READ, QUERY */

    To specify that no locking is needed for lookup tables in the 
    application's startup frame (for Ingres DBMS only):

        SET LOCKMODE ON lookup_table1 WHERE READLOCK = NOLOCK;
        SET LOCKMODE ON lookup_table2 WHERE READLOCK = NOLOCK;
        ...
