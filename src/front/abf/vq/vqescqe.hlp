The Query-End escape executes after the query has completed and there is
no more data to show the user; for example, when the user continues to 
select "NEXT" until all the data has been displayed. This escape only occurs 
in Update and Browse frames.

In Update and Browse frames where the Query Qualification frame behavior
is set to 'Enabled', the Query-End escape is followed by a 4GL
CLEAR FIELD ALL statement. If you do NOT want the CLEAR FIELD ALL
statement to execute, add the following to the frame's Form-Start escape:

        IIclear2 = 'n';

Example of Query-End escape code:

    To check how many rows were retrieved from the database:

        INQUIRE_INGRES (rows = ROWCOUNT);
