Columns that share the same name and datatype are considered "natural" joins, 
even though they might contain different information (for instance, a 
building address in a Master table and an employee address in a Detail table).

  * Lookup tables are joined to their associated Master or Detail table on 
    the first natural join.  
    - To change the join:
           1. Use DelJoin to delete the default join.  
	   2. Use AddJoin to specify the new join.
