/#-- vqrecapp.hlp, help for deciding whether to accept or reject changes to 
/#-- the VQ during reconciliation.
/#-- 
For each frame that needs to be changed in order to match the database, 
you must accept or reject all the proposed changes. To help you decide, you 
can first look at the before and after Visual Query for the frame. If you are
not sure, you can Cancel the changes, then write the report to a file. 
This way, you can take your time and look over the report to see if you 
really want to make all the changes. This is especially convenient for 
"what if" scenarios.

The menuitems are:
 
  OK            Accepts the changes.
  Cancel        Rejects the changes.
  OldVQ         Displays the Visual Query for the frame as it looks before 
                the proposed changes.
  NewVQ         Displays the Visual Query for the frame as it will look after 
                the proposed changes.
  WriteFile     Writes the reconciliation report to a file.
