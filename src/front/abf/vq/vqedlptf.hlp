Editing Local Procedure Source Code
                                                                  
  (NOTE -- General information about local procedures is provided below the 
   following description of Menu Items.  Simply scroll down the pages.)

Menu Items
----------
     Edit        Puts you in the system text editor. You can use the editor
                 to enter your local procedure code.

     File        Displays the ReadFile and WriteFile menuitems, which you can 
                 use to read from an existing file or write your local
		 procedure out to a file.

     Blank       Clears the source code window. Will ask if you want to save 
                 your changes or not.

     LineEdit    Allows you to move text in the source code window. You can 
                 insert, delete, split, or join lines.

     Variables   Displays the Local/Global Components Menu. On this menu, you
                 select a category: Local Variables, Global Variables, Global
                 Constants, or Record Types. Vision displays an input form
                 for the category you choose.

     Save        Saves your changes to the database without leaving the
                 screen. If you used ReadFile, changes are not saved to
                 the file.

When entering the source code for a new procedure, Vision provides you with
the skeleton of an empty procedure. If your procedure has parameters, these
must be inserted within the parentheses following the procedure name, for
example:
	PROCEDURE myproc(var1 = INTEGER, var2 = char(8)) =

Local 4GL procedures:

    * Can use the RESUME statement only within a submenu
    * Can use the RESUME FIELD, RESUME NEXT, RESUME ENTRY and RESUME MENU
      statements within a DISPLAY SUBMENU statement only
    * Cannot be called from a different source file
    * Can refer to local variables or global variables declared in the frame,
      except when local variables of the same name are declared in the local
      procedure.
