4GL statements can be broken into 4 types (select menuitem
"SubTopics" to see examples of the following):

1. Forms Statements:

                CLEAR
                CLEARROW
                DELETEROW
                DISPLAY SUBMENU, RUN SUBMENU
                HELP_FORMS, HELPFILE
                INITIALIZE *
                INITTABLE
                INQUIRE_FORMS
                INSERTROW
                MESSAGE
                MODE
                PRINTSCREEN
                PROMPT
                REDISPLAY
                RESUME *
                SCROLL
                SET_FORMS
                SLEEP
                UNLOADTABLE
                VALIDATE
                VALIDROW

2. Database Statements:

                DELETE
                INQUIRE_INGRES
                INSERT
                NEXT
                SELECT
                UPDATE

3. Flow-Control Statements for an Individual Frame:

                ENDLOOP
                IF-ELSEIF-ELSE-ENDIF
                RETURN
                WHILE

4. Flow-Control Statements for an Application:

                CALLFRAME
                CALLPROC
                CALL APPLICATION | QBF | REPORT ...
                CALL SYSTEM
                EXIT

Footnotes:
* 4gl Statements that should not be issued in Escape code:

    INITIALIZE - You should never issue this statement in escape code; the
		 4GL code generator creates it for you automatically. 

    RESUME - RESUME statements (and RESUME statement variants: RESUME FIELD
	     and RESUME NEXT) should only be issued in "Query-New-Data,"
	     "Before-Field-Entry," and "After-Field-Exit" escapes. This is 
	     because the RESUME statement effectively branches control out
	     of the 4GL operation; any 4GL statements in the operation 
	     following the RESUME are skipped. The three escapes mentioned
	     above are the only ones not followed by additional 4GL 
	     statements.

	     However, there may be cases where you want to skip the 4GL 
	     statements following an escape. For example, if an "Update-
	     Start" escape code segment detects an error in what the user
	     entered on the screen, you could have it skip the subsequent 
	     database update statements. In these cases, it is okay to issue 
	     a RESUME statement, but it is still a good idea to Edit the 
	     source code and review which 4GL statements will be skipped.
