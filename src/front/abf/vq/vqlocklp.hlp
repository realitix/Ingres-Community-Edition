Move the cursor to the setting you want to use, and press Select.

  * When the setting is "None" the locks are released immediately after the
    data is retrieved.
  * When the setting is "Dbms", the locks are held until after the user has
    finished updating the data.  The data cannot be updated by anyone
    else until the locks are released.
  * When the setting is "Optimistic", no locks are held, but a user cannot
    save a record (the change will be lost) if another user has updated it
    since the first user retrieved the record from the database.
