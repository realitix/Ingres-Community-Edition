Columns that share the same name and datatype are considered "natural" joins, 
even though they might contain different information (for instance, a 
building address in a Master table and an employee address in a Detail table).

  * Master and Detail tables are joined on EACH natural join.  Join columns 
    in the Detail table are not displayed as fields on the form.  If your 
    Master and Detail tables have more than one join, decide which join you 
    want to keep and then remove the other joins to display those columns 
    as fields on the form.  (You must leave at least one join in place.)

  * Lookup tables are joined to their associated Master or Detail table on 
    the FIRST natural join.  To change the join, first delete the default 
    join, then specify a new one.

To specify which columns you want to join:
    1. Move the cursor to one of the join columns and select Set_Join_Column.  
    2. Move your cursor to the other join column and select Set_Join_Column 
       again.
