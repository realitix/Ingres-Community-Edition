Destroying a frame is different from Removing a frame: 

  * When you Destroy a frame, it is deleted from the application. You 
    cannot insert it again later.  
    - Lower-level frames in the family are removed but not destroyed.  Since 
      they are not destroyed, they are available for inserting again later. 

  * When you Remove a frame, it is not destroyed.  
    - The menuitem that calls the frame is deleted from the parent frame.
    - Lower-level frames in the family are removed along with the frame.
    - All the frames that have been removed can be inserted again later.

The system will not let you destroy a frame while another user is editing it.

If you are not sure about destroying a frame, cancel this operation and use 
Remove instead.  (Be aware that you may end up storing unused frames.)
