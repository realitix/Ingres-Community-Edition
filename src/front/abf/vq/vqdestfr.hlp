Destroying a frame is not the same as Removing a frame.

  * When you Destroy a frame, it is deleted from the application. You 
    cannot insert it again later.  
    - Lower-level frames in the family are removed but not destroyed.  Since 
      they are not destroyed, they are available for inserting again later. 

  * When you Remove a frame, it is not destroyed.  
    - The menuitem that calls the frame is deleted from the parent frame.
    - Lower-level frames in the family are removed along with the frame.
    - All the frames that have been removed can be inserted again later.

If you are not sure you want to Destroy a frame, use Remove instead.  (Be 
aware that you may end up storing unused frames.)  

To Destroy or Remove a frame, select the appropriate menu operation and 
then type 'y' at the prompt.
