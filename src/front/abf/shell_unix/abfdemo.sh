#	Abfdemo		09/13/88 (trina)
#	
#	
#  Determines whether or not the demo has already been installed by checking
#  for the existence of the file :
#		$HOME/abfdemo/iidb_name.txt
#
#	
#  If the file exists, start up of abf on the database name found in 
#		iidb_name.txt
#  Otherwise,
#	-- get a database name from the user.  Will create the database
#	   if the user so desires.
#	-- create the directory $HOME/abfdemo along with the appropriate sub
#	   directories.
#	-- fill the database with the appropriate data
#	-- start abf on the database with the sample application (projmgmt)
#
#  History:
#	12-may-1989 (boba)
#		Fix path name of frame61.h in .c files.  Also cleaned up
#		similar transformation of .osq files and activated sysmod.
#	23-may-1989 (boba)
#		Remove unnecessary, unportable -i grep option.
#	07-June-1989 (fredv)
#		Changed the default source to $HOME/abfdemo.
#	09-oct-1989 (boba)
#		Remove logic that fixes path of frame61.h files now that
#		no .c files are present with 6.2 version of demo files.
#	17-oct-1989 (gautam/kimman)
#		Adding sreport and copyform so that abfdemo can find the
#		reports and forms.
#	25-jan-1990 (rog)
#		Allow user to use an already existing database.  Also, change
#		grep of createdb output to check exit status of createdb.
#	10-apr-1990 (rog)
#		Add support for using a database through INGRES/Net.
#	24-apr-1990 (gautam)
#		Fixed mkdir directory name
#	08-may-1990 (mgw)
#		Fixed typo in Welcome to INGRES ABF DEMO message.
#       01-Aug-2004 (hanch04)
#           First line of a shell script needs to be a ":" and
#           then the copyright should be next.
#	16-Feb-2010 (hanje04)
#	    SIR 123296

               Welcome to the INGRES ABF DEMONSTRATION!                    
                                                                           
        To use the INGRES ABF Demonstration, a database and some           
        files must be created for your use. The demonstration              
        creates a subdirectory called abfdemo in your login                
        (home) directory as well as a database using a name you            
        supply. When you run this command for the first time, it will      
        take several minutes while the necessary files are set up,         
        but after the installation process is completed, you can use       
        this command to start ABF and pick up where you left off.          
        The deldemo command can be used to de-install the demo and         
        remove your database.  If you use an existing database, some       
        tables, i.e., emp, projects, tasks, dependents, and some forms,    
        i.e., emp, projects, tasks, will be overwritten.
