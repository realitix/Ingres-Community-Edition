** Name:   find_space - find name space.
**
** Description:
**
**	find a numbered name space.  This also sets Hlen for use in the
**	hash function.  We want to be absolutely certain that Hlen tracks
**	with the hash table we're using, and this routine is always called
**	to get the SPACE information.  For this reason we also set Igncase
**	here, also.
**
** Inputs:
**
**     gcode - generation class code, ie. numeric identifier for table.
**
** Outputs:
**	pred - predecessor to space, if found (NULL) if head of list.
**
**     return:
**	entry on space list, NULL for failure.
