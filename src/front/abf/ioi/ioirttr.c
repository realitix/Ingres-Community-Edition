/**
** Name:	ioirtt.c - run time table read.
**
** Description:
**	IOI routine to read the runtime table
**
**  History:
**	10/14/92 (dkh) - Removed use of ArrayOf in favor of DSTARRAY.
**			 ArrayOf confused the alpha C compiler.
**      07-May-96 (fanra01)
**          bug# 76270
**          Added a call to rtt_init which initialises the template structure.
**          This call has been added to facilitate the initialisation of
**          the template structure with items which are not constant at compile
**          time.
