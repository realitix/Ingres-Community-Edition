You are looking at the definition of a Record Attribute.  You may change
the definition of the attribute on the form and through some of the menu
operations.  

Fill in the Data Type field with the datatype of the attribute.

Legal types are any Ingres datatype or any record type that has already been
defined for the application (through the "Edit a Record Type Definition"
frame.)  Legal Ingres data types can be listed and specified through the
ListChoices menu operation for this frame.  An Ingres datatype may also be
Nullable, which can be specified in the Nullable field.  An attribute that
is a record type may also be a dynamic array, which can be specified in the
Array field.

Record type attributes cannot be Nullable, and Ingres datatypes cannot be
dynamic arrays.

You cannot change the name of the record attribute at this screen. To do
this, select End (or Cancel if you made no changes to this screen), then
select Rename at the Edit a Record Type Definition screen.

The menu operations are:
