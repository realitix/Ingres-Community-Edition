You are looking at a catalog of the frame and procedure components defined and
used by an application.  The table field lists all the frames and procedures
along with their type and descriptive short remark.

To create a new frame or procedure, use the Create menu operation.  To perform
one of the menu operations on an existing application, first position the
cursor on the row containing the name of the frame or procedure of interest by
using the cursor keys or the table field scrolling keys.  After the cursor
has been positioned on the row containing the frame or procedure of interest,
select the desired menu operation.

To create or edit other global components (record type definitions, global
variables, or constants), use the Globals menu operation.

The menu options are:

        MENU COMMAND    SYNOPSIS
        ------------    --------
        Create          Create a definition of a new frame or procedure
                        component.  A series of pop-up frames will be
                        displayed that allow selection of the type of
                        component and specification of its name.  If the
                        component does not exist, it will be created and
                        you will be placed in the definition frame for that
                        component.

        Destroy         Destroy the frame or procedure you have selected from
                        the database.  You will be asked to confirm this
                        decision.  You may only destroy frames or procedures
                        that you are authorized to modify.

        Edit            Edit the selected frame or procedure.  This goes to
                        Edit Definition frame for the selected component, where
                        you can change its definition.

        Rename          Change the name of the frame or procedure you have
                        selected.  You will be prompted for the new name of 
                        the frame or procedure.  If you immediately depress 
                        the RETURN key without entering a name, the command is 
                        cancelled and the cursor returns to the table field.  
                        If you enter a legal name, the name of the component 
                        is changed in the database. 

        Go              Run the application.  This allows you to test
                        the application before you have finished defining
                        it, or before you create an executable image. 

        Globals         Create or edit application global variables, constants,
                        or record type definitions.

        Defaults        Edit the application's build parameters, which
                        includes the Source-Code Directory.

        Errors          Display the outstanding compilation errors for
                        the current application.

        Utilities       Brings up a submenu of utility functions to perform
                        on the application or in general.  You can create
                        an executable image of the application, or access
                        other Ingres utilities using INGRES/Menu.

        Help            Access the Ingres Help facility.

        End             Return to the application catalog frame.

        Quit            Exit the program.
