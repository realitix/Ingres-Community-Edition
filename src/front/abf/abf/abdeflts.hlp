You are looking at the default parameters for the application.  You can
change the values on the form and they will be saved when the application
is saved.

The Source-Code Directory field specifies the location of the directory
that will contain any source specification files for the application and
must have a value entered.  You should make sure this directory exists
before you specify its location in this field.

The Link Options file specifies the name of the file that contains any
additional link commands required to link your application (if any.)
This can be a file in the source directory for the application, or can
be the full path name specification for the file.

The Default Image field specifies the default name of the file that will
contain an executable image when you chose to create one.  Otherwise, the
image name will be determined from the name of the application.
(In any case, you can change the name before you create an image.)

One or the other, but not both, of the Default Start Frame or
Default Start Procedure field can have a name entered that will specify
the frame or procedure with which the application will begin execution
when it is run.

The Role field allows you to enter the role name under which the
application will run.  Roles allow you to give the application permissions
beyond those of the user running the application.  If you fill in this
field, you will be asked to give the role's password when you test the 
application or create an executable image.  (You can also override the
role name when you create an image.)

The next field lets you specify how the application behaves when run as
an image.  It asks whether the application should use compiled forms for
all Report and 4GL frames.  The usual answer is "yes".  That allows forms to
be activated faster and makes it easier to run the image against another
database.  If you answer "no", another field appears.  It asks whether 
new frames should use default to using compiled forms.  When you answer this
question, you are given the choice of converting all existing frames to the
new default. 

In Vision, another field appears.  It determines the default menu style for
Menu frames.

The menu operations are:

        MENU COMMAND            SYNOPSIS
        ------------            --------
        OK                      Return to the previous frame -- changes 
                                will be saved automatically.

        Cancel                  Ignore changes and return to the previous 
                                frame.

        Help                    Access the Ingres Help facility.
