/#--
You have customized your menu form and have also added or removed frames
which are not reflected on your form.  Vision does not know how to
reconcile your customizations with the menuitem changes that it needs
to make.

The menu operations are:

        MENU COMMAND            SYNOPSIS
        ------------            --------
        Select                  If Yes is selected, you will keep your 
				customized menu form. You will be responsible 
				for changing descriptions of menu selections 
				if the frame's children change.

                                If No is selected, a new menu form will be 
				generated.  Vision will remain responsible 
				for updating the form when the frame's 
				children change.

        Cancel                  Do not compile the frame.

        Help                    Access the Ingres Help facility.
