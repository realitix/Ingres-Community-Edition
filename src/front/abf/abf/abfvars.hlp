You are looking at the definition of a global variable.  You may change
the definition of the variable on the form and through some of the menu
operations.  

Fill in the Data Type field with the datatype of the global variable.

Legal types are any Ingres datatype or any record type that has already been
defined for the application (through the "Edit a Record Type Definition"
frame).  Legal Ingres datatypes can be listed and specified through the
ListChoices menu operation for this frame.  An Ingres datatype may also be
Nullable, which can be specified in the Nullable field.  A global variable
that is a record type may also be a dynamic array, which can be specified
in the Array field.

Record type global variables cannot be Nullable, and Ingres datatypes cannot
be dynamic arrays.


The menu operations are:
