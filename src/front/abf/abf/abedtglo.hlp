You are looking at a catalog of the global variables defined and used 
by an application.  The table field lists the names of all the global 
variables along with their data type, nullability, and a short remark.

To create a new global variable, use the Create menu operation.  To perform
one of the menu operations on an existing global variable, first position the
cursor on the row containing the name of the global variable of interest by
using the cursor keys or the table field scrolling keys.  After the cursor
has been positioned on the row containing the global variable of interest,
select the desired menu operation.

The menu options are:

        MENU COMMAND    SYNOPSIS
        ------------    --------
        Create          Create a definition of a new global variable.  If the
                        variable does not exist, it will be created and
                        you will be placed in the definition frame for that
                        variable.

        Destroy         Destroy the global variable you have selected.
                        You will be asked to confirm this decision.  You may
                        only destroy global variables that you are authorized
                        to modify.

        Edit            Edit the selected global variable.  This goes to an
                        Edit Definition frame for the selected variable where
                        you can change its definition.

        Rename          Change the name of the global variable you have
                        selected.  You are prompted for the new name of the
                        global variable.  If you immediately press the
                        RETURN key without entering a name, the command is
                        cancelled and the cursor returns to the table field.  
                        If you enter a legal name, the name of the component 
                        is changed in the database. 

        Help            Access the Ingres Help facility.

        End             Return to the application catalog frame.
