You have chosen the Cleanup operation, which will check the system catalogs 
for database objects that have been destroyed. If any are found, the catalog 
entries for these objects will be removed to free up space on your disk.  This
operation can take a significant amount of time.  You are being asked to 
confirm that the Cleanup should take place.

The menu operations are:

        MENU COMMAND            SYNOPSIS

        Select                  If Yes is selected, the Cleanup will start.

                                If No is selected, the Cleanup will not take
				place.  You will be put back into the
				Utilities submenu.
