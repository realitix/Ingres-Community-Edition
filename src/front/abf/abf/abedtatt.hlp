You are looking at a catalog of the attributes for a user-defined record
type definition that belongs to an application.  The table field lists the
names of all the record attributes along with their data type, Nullability,
and descriptive short remark.

To create a new record attribute, use the Create menu operation.  To perform
one of the menu operations on an existing record attribute, first position
the cursor on the row containing the name of the record attribute of interest
by using the cursor keys or the table field scrolling keys.  After the cursor
has been positioned on the row containing the record attribute of interest,
select the desired menu operation.

The menu options are:
