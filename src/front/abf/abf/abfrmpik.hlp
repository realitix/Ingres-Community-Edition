You have decided to create a frame component for an application and must now
choose the type of frame that you wish to create.  You can specify the type
by positioning the cursor on the row of the table field that describes the
type of frame that you want and then choosing the Select menu item.

The menu operations are:

        MENU COMMAND            SYNOPSIS
        ------------            --------
        Select                  Choose the type described by the current row
                                of the table field as the type of frame that
                                you wish to create.  You will then go to a
                                frame where you can specify the name of the
                                frame component that you want to create.

                                to the previous frame.
