You have chosen to create a new application.  This frame allows you to 
supply information about the application so that it can be created.

The Name field specifies the name of the application and must be unique
among all the applications in the database.  

The Language field specifies the default query language for the application, 
and the query language transaction semantics with which the application will 
start up.  This can either be QUEL or SQL, but can only be changed if your 
installation supports both query languages.

The Source-Code Directory field specifies the path name of the directory that 
will contain source specification files for the application.  By default, 
this will be the directory from which you started.  You can change this 
to any directory to which you can both read and write.

The Short and Long Remarks fields allow you to enter descriptions of the
application.

In VISION, a field appears which specifies which style to use for the menus 
in Menu Frames.  Its value will determine the default style for all newly 
created menu frames in this application.

The menu operations are:
