You are in the Utilities sub-menu.  This sub-menu allows you to select 
several utility operations.  Some operations are always available.  Others
affect the current application, and so are not available if there are no
applications in the database.

The menu commands are:

        MENU COMMANDS           SYNOPSIS
        -------------           --------
        Image                   Build an executable image of the current 
                                application that can later be run from the 
                                operating system level.

        AppReport               Generate a summary of information about
                                the current application.  The report may be 
                                saved or printed.

        INGRES/Menu             Call INGRES/MENU.  You will then be able
                                to call any Ingres subsystem (except 
                                Ingres/Applications) without losing your 
                                current context and on exit return back 
                                to here.

        Shell/Spawn/CLI         Escape to the operating system command
                                interpreter.  Exiting the command interpreter
                                will return back here.

        Reconcile               Check for discrepancies between the tables in 
                                the database and the definitions of specified 
                                frames in the current application. If any are 
                                found, change the frame definition to match 
                                the table structure or reject the changes. 
                                (This is only present if you are authorized to 
                                run Vision.)

        Cleanup                 Check the system catalogs for database objects
                                that have been destroyed. If any are found, 
                                remove the catalog entries for these objects 
                                to free up space on your disk.

        LockStatus              Examine locks for the current application.

        Help                    Access the Ingres Help facility.

        End                     Return to the current frame.
