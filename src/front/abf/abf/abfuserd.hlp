You are looking at the definition of a 4GL-language Frame.  You may
change the definition of the frame on the form and through some of the menu
operations.  Within the running application, this frame will display the form
shown in the Form Name field using the menu operations specified in the 4GL
source file for this frame that you have created.  (The name of this source
file is shown in the Source File field.)  Use the Edit menu item to examine
or edit the 4GL source specification for this frame.

Fill in the Return Type field with the datatype of the value that should be
returned by this frame, if any.   Legal return types are any Ingres type,
"string," or "none."  Legal return types are listed and may be specified
by selecting the ListChoices option with the cursor in the Return Type
field of this form.  A "string" or an Ingres return type may also be
Nullable, which can be specified in the Nullable field.

The Source File field specifies the file in which the 4GL specification for
this frame may be found.  This will be filled in initially on frame creation,
and may be modified.  The name used initially will be the same name as the
frame unless that name would cause conflicts with other source files in the
application, or the frame name is too long to be a file name on your system.
If such problems were found, the name will be truncated if too long, or
slightly modified if it would cause conflicts.

The Static field specifies whether this frame's data will be saved between 
calls.  Normally, this field should be set to "no".  If set to "yes", data
can be entered on the form, and the next time the frame is called the form
will be redisplayed with that data, rather than being cleared.

The menu operations are:

        MENU COMMANDS           SYNOPSIS
        -------------           --------
        NewEdit                 Get or create the definition of a different
                                application component object.  You will be
                                prompted for the type and name of the object
                                you wish to define.

        Go                      Test the User-Specified 4GL Frame.

        Edit                    Edit the text file containing the 4GL
                                specification for the frame using the
                                system text editor.

        Compile                 Check the syntax of the 4GL specification
                                for the frame and add the compiled version
                                to the application.  Any errors in the 4GL
                                specification will be displayed on the
                                terminal in an error listing.

        FormEdit                Run VIFRED on the form for this frame.  If
                                the form does not yet exist or you have not
                                named a form, VIFRED will allow you to
                                create a new form.

        LongRemark              Display and allow editing of the long remarks.

        Print                   Print the definition for the frame including
                                the text file containing its 4GL source
                                specification.

        Help                    Access the Ingres Help facility.

        Cancel                  Ignore any changes and return to the Edit 
                                Application catalog frame.

        End                     Save any changes and return to the Edit 
                                Application catalog frame.
