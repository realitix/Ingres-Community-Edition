You are looking at the definition of a 4GL-language Frame.  You may
change the definition of the frame on the form and through some of the menu
operations.  Within the running application, this frame will display the form
shown in the Form Name field using the menu operations specified in the 4GL
source file for this frame that you have created.  (The name of this source
file is shown in the Source File field.) 

Fill in the Return Type field with the datatype of the value that should be
returned by this frame, if any.   Legal return types are any Ingres type,
"string," or "none."  Legal return types are listed and may be specified
through the Field menu item of this frame's Help operation.  A "string" or
an Ingres return type may also be Nullable, which can be specified in the
Nullable field.

The Source File field specifies the file in which the 4GL specification for
this frame may be found.  This will be filled in initially on frame creation,
and may be modified.  The name used initially will be the same name as the
frame unless that name would cause conflicts with other source files in the
application, or the frame name is too long to be a file name on your system.
If such problems were found, the name will be truncated if too long, or
slightly modified if it would cause conflicts.

The Static field specifies whether this frame's data will be saved between 
calls.  Normally, this field should be set to "no".  If set to "yes", data
can be entered on the form, and the next time the frame is called the form
will be redisplayed with that data, rather than being cleared.

If the current application uses some non-compiled forms, you can specify 
whether this frame uses a compiled form or fetches its form from the database 
at run-time.

If this is a menu frame, you can specify which menu style to use.

The menu operations are:

        MENU COMMANDS           SYNOPSIS
        -------------           --------
        Rename                  Give the frame a new name.

        LongRemark              Display and allow editing of the long remarks.

	ListChoices             Display choices for the current field.

        Cancel                  Ignore any changes and return to the previous 
                                frame.

        Help                    Access the Ingres Help facility.

        End                     Save any changes and return to the previous 
                                frame.
