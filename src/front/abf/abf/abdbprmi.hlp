You are looking at the definition of an SQL database procedure.  You can change
the definition on the form and through some of the menu operations.  Within
the running application this procedure will execute whenever it is invoked
by any executing 4GL code.

If the name you have chosen for the procedure conflicts with the name of
an Ingres system function, a reverse-video warning will be displayed on this
form (unless the "-w" flag was specified when you started up.)  You may
continue to use the name for the procedure, but you will not be able to call
the corresponding system function from 4GL in this application.

A database procedure can only be specified as being a library procedure so
the Library field contains a display-only value of "Yes."  Database library
procedures are maintained externally and do not have any source file
associated with them.

Fill in the Return Type field with the data type of the value that will be
returned by this procedure, if any.   Legal return types are any integer
data type or "none."  Legal return types are listed and may be specified by
selecting the Field menu item of the Help operation.  An integer data type
may also be Nullable, which can be specified in the Nullable field.

The menu operations are:

        MENU COMMANDS           SYNOPSIS
        -------------           --------
        Rename                  Give the procedure a new name.

        LongRemark              Display and allow editing of the long remarks.

	ListChoices             Display choices for the current field.

        Cancel                  Ignore any changes and return to the previous 
                                frame.

        Help                    Access the Ingres Help facility.

        End                     Save any changes and return to the previous
