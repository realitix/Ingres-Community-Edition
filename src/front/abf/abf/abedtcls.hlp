You are looking at a catalog of all user-defined record types defined for
the application.  The table field lists the names of all the record types
along with their descriptive short remarks.

To create a new record type, use the Create menu operation.  To perform one
of the menu operations on an existing record type, first position the cursor
on the row containing the name of the record type of interest by using the
cursor keys or the table field scrolling keys.  After the cursor has been
positioned on the row containing the record type of interest, select the
desired menu operation.

The menu options are:
