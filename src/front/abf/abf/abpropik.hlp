You have decided to create a procedure component for an application and
must now choose the type of procedure that you wish to create.  You can
specify the type by positioning the cursor on the row of the table field
that describes the type of procedure that you want and then choosing the
Select menu item.

The menu operations are:

        MENU COMMAND            SYNOPSIS
        ------------            --------
        Select                  Choose the type described by the current row
                                of the table field as the type of procedure
                                that that you wish to create.  You will then
                                go to a frame where you can specify the name
                                of the procedure component that you want to
                                create.

        OtherLanguages          The original list of procedure types contains
                                all the embedded languages that your site is 
                                licensed to use.  OtherLanguages gives you a 
                                list of all supported languages.  If you
				choose from this list, it is assumed that you

        Cancel                  Cancel the Create operation and return
                                to the previous frame.
