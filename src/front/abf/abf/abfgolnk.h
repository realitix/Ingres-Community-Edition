** Name:	ABLNKTST -	The Run (Test Mode) Image Description.
**
** Description:
**	Describes the test mode image linked for the application (the test mode
**	is when GO is selected from ABF.)
**
**	For the DY case, the information is the actual addresses of
**	the tables for the runtime system.
**	
**	For the NODY case, the information needed is the name of the executable
**	that was built.  It gets run as a subprocess.
**
**	For the INTERP case, the information is the name of the file containing
**	the DS-encoded runtime tables.
**
** History:
**	1-sep-1986 (Joe)
**		First Written
**	01/88 (jhw) -- Added 'abrunopt' and made NODY always present if not
**		INTERP.
**	1/89 (bobm) - redefined.
**	08/89 (jhw) -- Added 'user_link' for when user libraries are linked
**		(only then will the interpreter be deleted on exit.)
**		JupBug #7357.
**	18-jun-92 (leighb) DeskTop Porting Change:
**		added 'abintimage' to point to the name to use when building
**		an interpreted image.
