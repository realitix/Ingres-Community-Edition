You are looking at a pop-up menu of the other global components that an
application defines (which are global variables, constants, or record type
definitions).  You may view a list of each type defined for the application
in a catalog by positioning the cursor on the row of the table field that
describes the component type and then choosing the Select menu item.  You
can also create, edit, or destroy them through these catalog frames.

The menu options are:

        MENU COMMAND    SYNOPSIS
        ------------    --------
        Select          Call the catalog frame for the component type.

        Help            Access the Ingres Help facility.

        End             Return to the application catalog frame.
