This frame contains a table field listing all the applications in the database.
The Name column lists the application names while the Owner column lists either
the username of the creator, or DBA for applications created by the DBA.  The
Short Remark column lists a short description of each application.

To create a new application, use the Create menu operation.  To perform one
of the menu operations on an existing application, first position the cursor
on the row containing the name of the application of interest by using the
cursor keys, the table field scrolling keys, or the Find, Top, or Bottom 
control and function keys. After the cursor has been positioned on the row
containing the application of interest, select the desired menu operation.

The menu operations are:

        MENU COMMANDS   SYNOPSIS
        -------------   --------
        Create          Create a new application.  You will be allowed
                        to specify the name and some other descriptive
                        information for the application through the
                        Application Create frame.

        Destroy         Delete the application you have selected from 
                        the database.  You will be asked to confirm this 
                        decision. 

        Edit            Edit the selected application.  Go to the Edit an
                        Application frame where you can change the application
                        definition by adding or modifying the application's
                        components.

        Rename          Change the name of the application you have selected.
                        You are prompted for the new name of the application.
                        If you immediately depress the RETURN key without
                        entering a name, the command is cancelled and the
                        cursor returns to the table field.  If you enter a 
			legal name, the name of the application is changed in 
			the database. 

        MoreInfo        Display additional information on the selected
                        application.  This operation brings up a new frame
                        whose form shows the creation and last modification
                        time of the selected application, as well as its full
			short and long descriptions.  You may change and save
			the short and long descriptions in the database at this
			point.

        Go              Run the application.  This allows you to test the
                        application before you have finished defining it, or
                        before you create an executable image.  The components
                        of the application will be recompiled if necessary.
                        You will then be prompted for the name of a frame with
                        which to begin execution.  Pressing just the RETURN
                        key in response to this prompt will cancel this
                        command.

        Utilities       Bring up a submenu of utility functions to perform
                        on the selected application or in general.  You can
                        create an executable image of the application, or
                        access other Ingres interfaces using INGRES/Menu.

        Help            Access the Ingres Help facility.

        Quit            Exit the program.
