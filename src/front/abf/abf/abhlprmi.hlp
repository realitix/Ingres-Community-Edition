You are looking at the definition of a host-language procedure.  You can
change the definition on the form and through some of the menu operations.
Within the running application this procedure will execute whenever it is
invoked by any executing 4GL or host-language code.

If the name you have chosen for the procedure conflicts with the name of
an Ingres system function, a reverse-video warning will be displayed on this
form (unless the "-w" flag was specified when you started up.)  You may
continue to use the name for the procedure, but you will not be able to call
the corresponding system function from 4GL in this application.

A host-language procedure may be specified as being a library procedure if
the Library field says "Yes."  Library procedures will be linked into an
application through the link options file. 
Their source code is maintained externally , so library procedures cannot
have a source code file specified as shown by the value of "<none>" in the
Source File field.

The Symbol field specifies the host link name associated with the procedure.
That is, the name the host operating system linker uses to call the procedure.
Usually this is the same as the name of the procedure, but can be
different if required.  This field should always have a value.

The Source File field specifies the file in which the host-language source
code for this procedure may be found, if any.  (Library procedures cannot
have a source code file.)  This will be set initially when the procedure
is created, but may be modified.

Fill in the Return Type field with the data type of the value that will be
returned by this procedure, if any.  Legal return types are any of the
integer, floating point or character data types, "string," or "none."  Legal
return types are listed and may be specified by selecting the Field menu item
of the Help operation.  Host-language procedures cannot return Nullable
values, which is why the Nullable field contains a display-only value of "No."

The menu operations are:

        MENU COMMANDS           SYNOPSIS

	ListChoices             Display choices for the current field.

        Cancel                  Ignore any changes and return to the previous 
                                frame.

        Help                    Access the Ingres Help facility.

        End                     Save any changes and return to the previous 
                                frame.
