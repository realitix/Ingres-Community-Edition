Search qualifications are indicated by using operators.  Some operators
can only work on character strings (text).  Other operators can work on
either character strings or numbers.

  Character string pattern matching operators:
    "*"         Matches any number of characters.
    "?"         Matches any single character.
    [...]       Matches characters between the brackets, including ranges

  Examples of character string pattern matching operators:
    C*          Finds text that begins with a capital "C".
                (California, Colorado, Connecticut)
    *JOHN*      Finds text that has "JOHN" somewhere within it.
                (JOHN SMITH, TERRY JOHNSON, MARY ST. JOHN)
    t*d         Finds text that begins with "t" and ends with "d".
                (tabloid, timid, toad)
    t?p         Finds text that begins with "t", ends with "p", and has only
                three characters.  (tap, tip, top)
    SD??-*      Finds text that begins with "SD", followed by any two
                characters, a hyphen, and any trailing characters.
                (SD37-XA-1992, SDRA-34A-WS49A, SD-X-A463)
    [AD]*       Finds text that begins with either capital "A" or "D".
                (Alaska, Alabama, Arizona, Delaware)
    [A-D]*      Finds text that begins with capital letters "A" through "D".
                (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, ..., Delaware)
    *[Aa]nn*    Finds text that has "Ann" or "ann" somewhere within it.
                (Anne Johnson, Maryann Wilson)

  Comparison operators:
    "="         equal to
    "<>", "!="  not equal to
    "<"         less than
    "<="        less than or equal to
    ">"         greater than
    ">="        greater than or equal to

  Examples of comparison operators:
    <10000      Finds numbers less than 10000.
    >=37.5      Finds numbers greater than or equal to 37.5.
    <>SOLD      Finds text that isn't equal to "SOLD".
    
  Notes:
    Character string search conditions are case-sensitive.  For example, if
    you enter "Franklin" as a search condition, INGRES won't find "FRANKLIN"
    or "franklin" in the database.

    You cannot mix pattern matching operators with comparison operators.
    For example, "<>S*" is not permitted.

    If no operator is specified and a value is entered in a field, then
    the "=" operator is assumed.

    If you wish to search for a string with a "*" or "?" in it, use the
    backslash character to keep INGRES from treating it like a pattern
    matching operator.  For example, "*\?" will find text that ends with a
    question mark.

    In some installations, the underscore (_) and percent sign (%) are
    used in place of the "?" and "*" pattern matching characters (controlled
    by II_PATTERN_MATCH).  Consult your system administrator if you are not
    sure which pattern matching operators are in use.

    On INGRES gateways, the range pattern matching operator "[...]", the
    not equal operator (!=), and the backslash indicator (\) may not work.
    Other restrictions may also apply - see your gateway Installation and
    Operation Guide for further information.
