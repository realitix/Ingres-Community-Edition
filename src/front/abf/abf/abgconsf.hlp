This frame allows you to create a file loaded with the application's global
constants. You may then edit and change the values for the global constants 
of your choice with alternate values. The resulting global constants file
will be used to override the application's global constants during 'Go' and 
'Image' of the application.

To use, fill in the field with a proper file name, create and edit the file. 
When editing, make sure your syntax conforms with the original syntax.

To revert back to global constants from the application's catalog, clear
the field and take the 'End' option.


The menu commands are:

        MENU COMMANDS           SYNOPSIS
