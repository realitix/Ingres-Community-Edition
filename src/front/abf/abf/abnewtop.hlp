/#-- abnewtop.hlp, help for popup that let's you define an Vision starting
/#-- frame for an ABF application.
/#--
On this popup you may enter the name of a new menu frame that Vision will
use as the starting frame for your application.  You my also choose to
select the 'Catalog' menuitem (assuming you have purchased ABF) if you
wish to edit this application using the ABF Frame Catalog. 

Although initially the top frame of the Application Flow Diagram is a menu
frame, it is possible to change this by changing the 'Default starting frame'
of the Application to any Vision frame type. The 'Default starting frame'
can be changed by going to the 'Application Catalog', positioning on the
application, and invoking the 'MoreInfo', then 'Defaults' menuitems.

After you create the new menu frame, you can use the 'Insert' menuitem 
from the Application Flow Diagram editor to attach your existing
ABF frames to the Vision frame.

  OK            Creates the new Vision menu frame.
  Cancel        Go back to the Application Catalog.
  Catalog	Go directly to the ABF Frame Catalog.
