You are looking at the definition of a QBF Frame.  You may change the
definition of the frame on the form and through some of the menu operations.
Within the running application, this frame will call QBF with the specified
table or join definition, and optional form.  The specified command line
flags will be passed to QBF as well.  See the "Using Ingres Through Forms
and Menus" manual for more information on how QBF uses these values.

The Query Object Name field specifies the name of a query object to be run
by QBF.  This is either a join definition (JoinDef) or a database table as
specified by the Query Object Type field.

The Form Name field specifies the name of a form to be used by QBF when
running the query object.  If not specified, QBF will create a default
form to use with the query object.

The menu operations are:
