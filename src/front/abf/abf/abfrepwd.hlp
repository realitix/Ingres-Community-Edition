You are looking at the definition of a Report frame.  You may change
the definition of the frame on the form and through some of the menu
operations.  Within the running application, the frame will run the
report named in the Report Name field.

The report name is the name of an existing report in your database.  To
create a new report, select the Edit menu operation, which will call RBF
to specify the report.  If you wish to specify a new report using the
Report-Writer command language, fill in the Report Source File field with
the name of the file to contain the report specification before selecting
the Edit menu item.  Edit can also be used to change the existing report
definition.

Use the Output File field to specify where the report output is to be
directed when the application is executed.  This is either a file name
or "printer" or "terminal."

If the report has parameters, and you wish the user to specify the parameters
in a VIFRED form, fill in the Report Form field.  Use the FormEdit menu item
to create or edit the named form.  The form you specify here can be used to
input the parameters for the report.  If the current application uses 
some non-compiled forms, you can specify whether to use a compiled form or
fetch the form from the database at run-time.

Use the Command Line Flags field for any additional Report Writer flags
you wish to use.  See the "Ingres: Report-Writer Reference
Manual" for more information on the command line flags.

The menu operations are:

        MENU COMMAND            SYNOPSIS
        ------------            --------
        NewEdit                 Get or create the definition of a different
                                application component object.  You will be
                                prompted for the type and name of the object
                                you wish to define.

        Go                      Test the Report frame.

        Edit                    Edit the specification for the report.  This
				either edits the text file named in the Report
                                Source File field using the system text editor
                                or calls RBF to edit the specified report if
                                no source file was specified.  If the report
                                does not yet exist, RBF will allow you to
                                create a new one.

        Compile                 Call SREPORT to compile the source file 
                                named in the Report Source File field.  Note
                                that if this report is specified using RBF,
                                then this menu item is not applicable.

        FormEdit                Run VIFRED on the form for the frame.  If
                                the form does not yet exist, VIFRED will
                                allow you to create a new one.  Note that
                                a form must be specified for this menu item
                                to be applicable.

        LongRemark              Display and allow editing of the long remarks.

        Print                   Print the definition for the frame.

        Help                    Access the Ingres Help facility.

        Cancel                  Ignore any changes and return to the Edit 
                                Application catalog frame.

        End                     Save any changes and return to the Edit 
                                Application catalog frame.
