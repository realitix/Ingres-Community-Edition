/#-- abedlock.hlp, help at the pop-up warning users that the application 
/#-- is in use by others.
/#-- 
The display shows you the login name(s) of the people currently working in 
this application/frame. 

If you choose to go ahead and work in the same area of the application that 
is already in use, you run the risk of overwriting the work of others--or 
having them overwrite yours.  The last session to complete overwrites the 
work of the other session(s).
 
At this point, you may select Cancel to end the edit request, or you may
select OK to proceed with the editing of the application/frame.

Note that it is possible that a previous session exited abnormally, leaving
the impression that another session is still active.  If this is true, you
may eliminate this session indicator by choosing the 'Delete' menuitem.
