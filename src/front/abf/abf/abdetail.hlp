Applications Catalog Details Form

     This form provides additional details about a selected application.
     All fields are display-only except for the Short and Long Remarks
     fields, which may be updated.  A "Save" command is provided on the
     menu to store any updated information in the database.  "Next"
     ("Previous") will show the Details frame for the application which
     appears after (before) the current application in the main catalog
     table field.  "Next" will advance to the top application of the
     catalog table field if the current application is the last one, and
     similarly for "Previous".
