This frame allows you to create an executable image of the application.
This image can then be run from the operating system level as a complete
application.  Please note that creating an image can be a time-consuming 
operation.

Fill in the first field with the name of a file, to be placed in your current
directory, which will contain the executable image.

You can also override the default role for the application by changing the
second field on the form.

See the Ingres Forms-based Application Development Tools User Guide for more
information on the use of image files.
