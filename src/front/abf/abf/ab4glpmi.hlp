You are looking at the definition of a 4GL procedure.  You can change the
definition on the form and through some of the menu operations.  Within
the running application this procedure will execute whenever it is invoked
by any executing 4GL code.

If the name you have chosen for the procedure conflicts with the name of
an Ingres system function, a reverse-video warning will be displayed on this
form (unless the "-w" flag was specified when you started up.)  You may
continue to use the name for the procedure, but you will not be able to call
the corresponding system function from 4GL in this application.

The Source File field specifies the file in which the 4GL specification for
this procedure may be found.  This will be set initially when the
procedure is created, but may be modified.

Fill in the Return Type field with the data type of the value that will be
returned by this procedure, if any.   Legal return types are any Ingres
data type, "string," or "none."  Legal return types are listed and may be
specified by selecting the Field menu item of the Help operation.  A "string"
or an Ingres data type may also be Nullable, which can be specified in the
Nullable field.

The menu operations are:

        End                     Save any changes and return to the previous 
                                frame.
