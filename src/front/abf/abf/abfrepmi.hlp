You are looking at the definition of a Report frame.  You may change
the definition of the frame on the form and through some of the menu
operations.  Within the running application, the frame will run the
report named in the Report Name field.

The report name is the name of an existing report in your database.
If you wish to specify a new report using the Report-Writer command 
language, fill in the Report Source File field with the name of the file 
to contain the report specification.

Use the Output File field to specify where the report output is to be
directed when the application is executed.  This is either a file name
or "printer" or "terminal."

If the report has parameters, and you wish the user to specify the parameters
in a VIFRED form, fill in the Report Form field.  If the current application 
uses some non-compiled forms, you can specify whether to use a compiled form 
or fetch the form from the database at run-time.

Use the Command Line Flags field for any additional Report Writer flags
you wish to use.  See the Ingres Character-based Querying and Reporting Tools
User Guide for more information on the command line flags.
The menu operations are:
