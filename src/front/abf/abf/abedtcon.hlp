You are looking at a catalog of all global constants in the application.
The table field lists the names of all the constants along with their
data type, nullability, and a short remark.

To create a new constant, use the Create menu operation.  To perform
one of the menu operations on an existing constant, first position the
cursor on the row containing the name of the constant of interest by
using the cursor keys or the table field scrolling keys.  After the cursor
has been positioned on the row containing the constant of interest,
select the desired menu operation.

The menu options are:

        MENU COMMAND    SYNOPSIS
        ------------    --------
        Create          Create a definition of a new constant.  If the
                        constant does not exist, it will be created and
                        you will be placed in the definition frame for that
                        constant.

        Destroy         Destroy the constant you have selected.
                        You will be asked to confirm this decision.  You may
			only destroy a constant that you are authorized
			to modify.

        Edit            Edit the selected constant.  This goes to an
                        Edit Definition frame for the selected constant where
                        you can change its definition.

        Rename          Change the name of the constant you have
                        selected.  You are prompted for the new name of the
                        constant.  If you immediately press the
                        RETURN key without entering a name, the command is
                        cancelled and the cursor returns to the table field.  
			If you enter a legal name, the name of the component 
			is changed in the database.

        Help            Access the Ingres Help facility.

        End             Return to the application catalog frame.
