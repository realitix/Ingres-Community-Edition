**
** Description:
**	Contains the definitions for the messages and error messages of ABF.
**
** History:
**	Revision 6.0  87/08/04  bobm
**	Initial revision.
**	Revision 6.2  89/09/20  kevinm  (JupBug #7289)
**	Added two messages for the OtherLanguages menuitem,
**	F_AB002D_OtherLang_expl and F_AB002E_Other.
**
**	Revision 6.3  89/11  wong
**	Added illegal file-name message, E_AB0138.
**
**	90/03  wong  Added unsupported language message, E_AB0139.
**	23-oct-1990 (mgw)
**		Corrected some misspellings. All are in comments, not messages,
**		but these comments get picked up for the messages.txt file via
**		erxtract and are thus in a deliverable.
**	14-aug-91 (blaise)
**		Added E_AB0154_NoObjFile.
**	22-aug-91 (blaise)
**		E_AB0154_NoObjFile now only takes one argument.
**	26-feb-1992 (mgw)
**		Added E_AB0155_OSCompErr.
**	28-feb-1992 (mgw) Bug #41111
**		Made S_AB0146_ReturnChange and S_AB0148_FrameChange obsolete
**		and replaced them with S_AB0156_NewReturnChange and
**		S_AB0157_NewFrameChange respectively to have these messages
**		refer to frames or procedures as appropriate instead of just
**		frames.
**	16-Nov-1992 (donc) Bug #44162
**		Added E_AB036_BadSymbolName 
**	13-oct-92 (davel)
**		Added fast messages for support of the new Global Constants 
**		File utility screen - F_AB00E0 through F_AB00E6.
**	26-oct-92 (davel)
**		Added E_AB0129 and E_AB012A for global constant backward
**		compatibilty warnings.
**	20-nov-92 (mgw)
**		Added more fast messages for Global Constants support.
**		F_AB00E7 - F_AB00EA will be used in an IIUFccConfirmChoice
**		call.
**	12-jan-93 (essi)
**		Added several messages for the support of global constants
**		file.
**	15-jan-93 (davel)
**		Added E_AB012B_TypeChange (datatype of global constant cannot
**		be changed during "edit a constant" operation). Also made
**		small changes to other global constant messages.
**	11-feb-93 (blaise)
**		Integrated DonC's change from 63p code line: added
**		E_AB036B_Bad_SymbolName
**	18-Feb-1993 (connie) Bug #48982
**		Added S_AB0158_RunHostLangProc,F_AB00BC_Title,F_AB00BD_Yestext,
**		F_AB00BE_Notext, F_AB00BF_CHelp
**	23-feb-1993 (connie) Bug #40884
**		Added E_AB0281_PathName to check for pathname in source file
**	22-feb-93 (davel)
**		Added E_AB036A_Bad_PassDecimal message.
**	26-jul-93 (blaise)
**		Added F_AB00EB to F_AB00EF - comments written to global
**		constants file.
**	16-mar-94 (lan)
**		Fixed bug #58066 - Replaced 'Technical Support Representative'
**		with 'Site Technical Contact'.
