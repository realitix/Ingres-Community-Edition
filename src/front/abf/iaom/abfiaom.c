/*
**	Name:	abfiaom.c
**
**	Description: Contains routines to pass data values across boundaries.
**
**	In order to put the IAOM directory files in a Dynamic Link and/or
**	Shared Library, it is necessary not to have references from IAOM
**	to data in other ABF directories and not to have references from
**	other ABF directories to data in IAOM.  This is because DLLs and
**	ShareLibs can only access functions across boundaries at compile/link
**	time.  Therefore functions were created to pass data pointers across 
**	these boundaries at run time.  Two of these functions reside in this
**	module; the first gets the VISION flag, IIabVision from ABF and 
**	stores a copy of its value in IIab_Vision; the other passes to the 
**	abf/abmain.c routine in IIABF the address of a structure which 
**	contains addresses of most of the data that resides in IAOM that is 
**	needed in IIABF.  Other data, needed by multiple programs created from 
**	the ABF directories, are passed via functions that reside in 
**	iaom/abclass.c and iaom/iamsystm.c
**
**	History:
**
**	02-dec-91 (leighb) DeskTop Porting Change: Created.
