/*{
** Name:	IIAMfeFrmExist
**
** Description:
**	IAOM procedure to determine the existence of a frame.  Should
**	not be called by routines called from ILRF as it is too costly.	 These
**	routines will limit themselves directly to the ii_encodings table.
**
** Inputs:
**	fid	frame to check
**
** Outputs:
**	t	frame time stamp, if applicable.  NULL pointer may be passed
**		in if not needed.
**
**	return:
**		ILE_FRDWR - INGRES failure
**		ILE_FIDBAD - frame does not exist.
**		ILE_ILMISSING - exists in ii_objects, but not in ii_encodings.
**		OK - exists, and is encoded.
**
** Side effects:
**	produces non-fatal error messages when inconsistencies are detected
**	in the tables.
**
** History
**	8/86 (rlm)	written
**	18-aug-88 (kenl)
**		Changed QUEL to SQL.
**	09-nov-88 (marian)
**		Modified column names for extended catalogs to allow them
**		to work with gateways.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
