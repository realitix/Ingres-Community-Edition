This directory has a corresponding /test directory. It is:

	/devsrc/62/front/abf/pete/test/fg

To build a stand-alone framegen executable for testing:

	% area front abf pete fg
	% ming lib
	% cd ../../test/fg
	% ming lib
	% ming framegen
	% framegen mdupdate
	
    The above will create a file called mdupdate.osq in the directory:

	/devsrc/62/front/install/emerald/abfsrc/pete/fgdemo

    The contents of "mdupdate.osq" can be diffed against the previous
    version of that file in "mdupdate_save.osq". Just typing "framegen"
    will give a useage note.

    There is an abf application called 'fgdemo' with frames that correspond
    to each of the frames that 'framegen' can create.

    To run against test versions of the templates, set II_TFDIR:

	% setenv II_TFDIR /devsrc/62/front/abf/pete/src/fg

    and then run framegen.
