/**
** Name:	fghelp.c - generate help_forms statement & copy help file.
**
** Description:
**	This routine processes a ##GENERATE HELP statement, and writes out:
**	  1. one or more help files to the application source directory with
**	the name "source file name" + .hlp, .hlq or .hla. These help files
**	are copies of the help file name listed on the GENERATE HELP statement,
**	and must exist in the II_CONFIG/language directory.
**
**	  2. A HELPFILE statement in the generated 4gl file that points to
**	the above help file in the source directory (each help file written
**	gets its own HELPFILE statement).
**	
**	If a help file already exists, then a new one is not copied.
**	----------------------------------------------------------------
**
**	Anticipated problems with this method of copying help files:
**	
**	  1. If user changes frame type
**	  after codegen, but doesn't change source file name, then code
**	  generator will see that help files already exist for the frame,
**	  and won't copy new ones. But the existing help files for that
**	  frame are the wrong ones!
**
**	  2. If code and help files are generated, and user edits the
**	  help file, and then changes the source file name, then we will
**	  generate new help files and point the HELPFILE statements at
**	  them. User will then have to rename their edited help files.
**
**	There are a couple cases that require us to check for
**	the existance of a help file every time a frame is generated, rather
**	than just the first time. It appears to not be a significant performance
**	hit to generate the help files every time we generate 4gl.
**
**		We base the help file name on the source file name; if
**		the user changes source file name, we need to generate
**		new .hlp files (and we won't know that the source
**		file name has changed). Otherwise, for a previously
**		generated frame, we'll generate a HELPFILE statement
**		pointing to the (presumed) existing .hlp file with that
**		name -- but there won't be one.
**
**		VQ options (esp Insert master allowed) can make
**		entire menus come and go, which could cause the code
**		generator to process a GENERATE HELP statement, that
**		it has never seen before).
**		
**		Worse yet, some menuitems come and go based on VQ options
**		and $vars, such as $insert_master_allowed or
**		$delete_master_allowed. If the user hasn't changed the
**		help file, then we can safely regenerate
**		the file, otherwise not. But, unfortunately, we don't track
**		the date when we last generated a help file. Would be
**		nice if $vars could be used inside the help files to restrict
**		or include sections of the help file. (This should be a
**		stretch goal, as should GENERATE USER_MENUITEM_HELP. In the
**		mean time, we'll generate .hlp files with menuitems 
**		that don't exist on the menuline (user must edit and remove).
**
**  Possible future enhancements:
**	Treat the .osq and .hlp files as one code generation:
**	give .hlp files temp names & keep a stack of them along with
**	.osq file name -- then when all done rename everything in stack.
**
**	Write the date generated into a comment line in the generated help
**	file. Then, generating again, if the help file already exists, compare
**	this internal date/time with that for the help file. If it indicates
**	that the help file has been changed, then do not create a new help
**	file; otherwise create a new help file and clobber the old one.
**
**	This file defines:
**	IIFGhelp
**
** History:
**	5/17/89 (pete)	written.
**	3/15/90 (pete)	change HELP_FORMS to HELPFILE
**	1-may-91 (blaise)
**		Tidied up code: changed a while loop to an if statement to
**		prevent compiler warnings.
**	11-Feb-93 (fredb)
**	   Porting change for hp9_mpe: SIfopen is required for additional
**	   control of file characteristics in IIFGhelp.
**	22-Feb-93 (fredb)
**	   Porting change for hp9_mpe: Look for help files in II_HELPDIR
**	   instead of II_CONFIG.  Lack of directory depth makes ABF/VISION
**	   much more interesting to port ...
**	23-Feb-93 (fredb)
**	   Porting change for hp9_mpe: Major surgery in the way the help
**	   filenames are generated due to the MPE/iX file system and the
**	   limitations of LO.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
