/**
** Name: iewdetal.sc
** 
** Defines:
**	IIIEwao_WriteIIAbfObjects()	populates ii_abfobjects (most
**					objects end up here)
**	IIIEwqn_WriteIIQbfNames()	populates qbfnames to ii_qbfnames
**	IIIEwjd_WriteIIJoinDefs()	populates joindefs ii_joindefs
**	IIIEwf_WriteIIForms()		populates forms ii_forms
**	IIIEwir_WriteIIReports()	populates report to ii_reports
**
** Description:
**	This family of routines process the detail line of an object in
** the intermediate file. The file is set up such that the first line
** (preceded by OC_XXX:) is written to ii_objects; the next line is written
** to whichever catalog is appropriate for the given object. Most objects
** end up in ii_abfobjects; other objects (qbfnames, joindefs, forms,
** reports) are written to their own catalogs instead. The catalog
** architecture is somewhat inconsistant and historical. Sigh.
**
** In general, these routines do no i/o per se; they just process the
** buffer passed in to them, which contains the current (detail) line in
** the file. They use cu_gettok() to get an attribute at a time; if its not
** a string, CVal or CVan is used to convert the attribute into the numeric
** type. Unfortunately, these CV routines aren't robust, don't contain
** status checks, and AV if you don't pass it a numeric. But that's what
** we're stuck with.
**
** Once we get the data from the buffer into local variables, we'll
** either update the existing object in the catalogs, or create a new one.
** The caller has already filled in the update field of the IEOBJREC record
** passed to us (objrec) as to whether the object should be updated or
** created.
**
** Keep in mind that the ubiquitous char *inbuf parameter gets hacked up by
** cu_gettok(); in breaking the thing up, it replaces the tabs in the line with
** nulls. But the caller never looks at the buffer again, so it really doesn't
** matter. Thought I should mention it in case dear maintenence person is
** looking at buffers and shme through the debugger.

** Description:
**	Similar to the other routines in this file, this routine populates

** process the record members, which immediate follow the record definition.
**
** Input:

**	i4		appid		id of application object belongs to
**	char		*appowner	owner of application 
**	char		*inbuf		current line in file
**	FILE		*fp		file pointer to intermediate file 
**
** Output:
**	char		*inbuf		updated if the object was a record.
**	FILE		*fp		also updated for records.
**
** Returns:
**	Whatever the status of the query in question returns.

		** won't affect IIIMPORT. But copyapp out is another story.
		** Here's the problem:
		**
		** Joindefs have/had an "unused" column, qinfo5. So its not 
		** written to copyapp files. Fine. But, for 6.5 joindefs, you 
		** can use owner.table to fully qualify a table reference. 
		** The owner of the talbe is stored in qinfo5. Terrific.
		** Anyway, this won't get written to a copyapp file, or an 
		** iiexport file until it gets fixed.
		**
		** Its also important to note that for some reason this column
		** is nullable, while the others are not, and use "" when no
		** value is present. So we'll need to use a null indicator in
		** the query.
		**
		** This routine will have to somehow know the version of 
		** the file. We could either pass this on straight through all 
		** the other callers, or set up some global.
		**
		** So, going to have to get qinfo5 eventually; the problem with
