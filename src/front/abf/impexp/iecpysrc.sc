** Name: iecpysrc.sc		-- copy the source files, if specified
**
** Defines:
**	IIIEcsf_CopySourceFiles()	- process the copysrc flag
**	IIIEci_Copy_It()		- actually perform the file xfer
**
** Description:
**	Handles the -copysrc and -listing flags, which require going through
**	the list of sources in the application, so this is where we do it.
**
** History:
**	25-aug-93 (daver)
**		First Written/Stolen from abf!copyapp!insrcs.qsc
**	14-sep-1993 (daver)
**		Got rid of statics, re-documented.
**	01-dec-1993 (daver)
**		Used char buffers directly with LOtos() to determine if
**		the source and destination directories are the same.
**		Fixes bug #57350.
**	04-jan-1994 (daver)
**		Fixed bugs 57935 and 58031: Allowed listing files to 
**		be generated when the source code directories of both 
**		the incoming and target frames are the same. Also fixed 
**		problems in marking these frames to be regenerated when
**		said directories are the same, and when they're not.
