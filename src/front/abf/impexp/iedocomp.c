/*{
** Name: IIEdcr_DoComponentRecs()	- process component record
**
** Description:
**
** This routine processes all the components of a given object. Given
** the object information, application id, file information, this routine
** will read all the components of our current record, and write the
** information to the appropriate system catalogs. When we 
** finish, the file pointer information (fp and inbuf) point to the 
** line AFTER the last component; that is, the NEXT object to be 
** processed, or EOF.
**
** In the beginning, fp and inbuf point to the detail record of our object.
** We first read in the next line. MOST objects have at least one component
** record, even if its only just a DUMMY record for a CUC_AODEPEND 
** (a dummy dependency record). (The exceptions are JoinDefs and RECMEMS,
** to be dealt with later). Unlike the object record, the component
** record's structure is like this:
**
**	NAME_OF_COMPONENT:
**	\t<data>\t<data>\t<data>...
**
** which means that the only thing on this first line will be a component
** "title" record. That's our "outer" loop. The "inner" loop reads the
** file, and calls individual write routines to populate the data to the
** specific component catalog.
**
** Psuedocode:
**	+ Read a "Component Title" Record
**	+ Figure out if its a Component (could be a new object, like a
**		RECMEM or JoinDef, for instance)
** 	+ WHILE the record we have is a Component Title Record:       (outer)
** 
** 		- If the object is being updated, Delete the old 
** 			component entries; its a 1:N relationship,
** 			so thats what we gotta do.
** 		- Read a Component detail record (saving the component type)
**
** 		- WHILE the record is a Component detail record:      (inner)
** 			= Write to the appropriate component catalog
** 			= Read another record
** 		- ENDWHILE                                            (inner)
** 
** 	+ENDWHILE                                                    (outer)
** 
** When we fall out of the inner loop, we're pointing to the record AFTER
** our current component definition. Conveniently, we flip to the top of
** the loop: if its another component, stay where we are, and keep
** processing all the components for this object. If its not
** another component, it'll be a new object or EOF, and we're outta here.
** 
** Input:
**	IEOBJREC        *objrec		- parent object of these components
**				->id	- object id for this component
**	i4              appid		- application id 
**	char		*appowner	- application owner
**	char            *inbuf		- current line of the file
**	FILE            *fp		- current place in file
**
** Output:
**	char		*inbuf		the next line of the file, read in
**	FILE		*fp		updated pointer in the file
**
** Returns:
**	OK		More objects to process.
**	CUQUIT		Big time Error. Issue that "Processing Stops" message.
**	ENDFILE		EOF hit. Its ok. Time to leave. We're done.
**
** Side Effects:
**	Sends queries to the system catalogs which reflect the component
**	information read from the intermediate file.
**
** History:
**	18-aug-1993 (daver)
**		First Written/Documented.
**	14-sep-1993 (daver)
**		Enhanced error handling, erie.msg messages, etc.
