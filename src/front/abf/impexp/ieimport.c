/*{
** Name:	IIIEiii_IIImport - read in a file containing FE objects
**
** Description:
**	Reads an intermediate file containing definitions for one or more FE
**	objects and writes them to the open database.  
**
**
** Input:
**	OOID	appid		object id of the application specified 
**					on the command line
**
**	char	*appowner	owner of application specified as above
**
**	i4	allflags	contains settings for copysrc and check flags
**
**	char	*oldsrcdir	ptr to buffer, for src code dir found in file
**
**	IEPARAMS **srclist	pointer to parameter list. 
**
** Output:
**	IEPARAMS **srclist	link list of objects which have source files 
**				to be copied (i.e., User Frames, customized
**				Vision frames, 4GL/3GL procedures).
**
** Returns:
**	OK		completed successfully.
**	CUQUIT		tells parent to issue that "Processing Stops" message
**      CHECKFAIL       -check was specified, and we at least one object
**                      found in intermediate file did NOT exist in the
**                      target application
**      CHECKOK         -check was specified, and everything existed in
**                      the target application.
**
** Side Effects:
**	This routine performs the abort transaction if an error is detected
**	during a dbms read/write; by returning CUQUIT, the parent exits and
**	prints that ever-popular "Processing Stops. No changes will be made."
**	message.
**
** History:
**	14-jul-1993 (daver)
**		First written. Some of this routine was taken from cu_rdobj(); 
**		but the copyutil library is so hosed up it is easier to 
**		re-write for this specific task than to use the "cute", 
**		twisted logic that exists.
**	13-sep-1993 (daver)
**		Documented, msgs extracted to erie.msg, cleaned up.
**	04-jan-1994 (daver)
**		Build a srclist iff we're copying source or we're
**		writing a listing file. Return different values
**		(CHECKOK, CHECKFAIL) if the -check flag is specified.
**		Fixes bug 57935.
**	26-jan-1994 (daver)
**		Store object_id of records, use it when "finding" record
**		member objects. Fixes bug 58570.
