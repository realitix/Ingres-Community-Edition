/*{
** Name:        IIIEdrr_DoRecordRecmem() - process the record types
**
** Description:
**
** We're processing a record. The caller has just written the appid 
** and record object id to ii_abfobjects catalog. Now comes the fun part.
** We now have to read out of the file for the OC_RECMEMs and the
** inevitable CUC_AODEPEND records. The format of a record type looks
** like this in the intermediate file:
**
** 	OC_RECORD:	<ii_objects info for that record>
** 		<ii_abfobjects info for that record>
** 	OC_RECMEM:	<ii_objects info for that record member>
** 		<ii_abfclasses info for the record, record member pair>
** 
** 	<more OC_RECMEM definitions>
** 
** 	CUC_AODEPEND:
** 		<either a DUMMY entry, or a real dependency i.e.,
** 		records with other records as elements>
** 
** A dependency record (CUC_AODEPEND) always ends the definition.
** Each OC_RECMEM must be added to ii_objects and ii_abfclasses
** (and not ii_abfobjects). So, the psuedocode goes like this:
**
** Read a record from the file 
** WHILE still a recmem
** 	write the recmem header to ii_objects
** 	read the recmem detail from the file
** 	write the recmem detail to ii_abfclasses
** 	read another record
** ENDLOOP
**
** (( the record that falls out of the loop should be ))
** (( the dependency record for the parent OC_RECORD ))
**
** IF that record isn't a CUC_AODEPEND or CUC_ADEPEND
** 	return ok, there's no dependencies, we're outta here
** If we're updating that record
**	Delete the existing dependencies
** (( now we're going to populate the record's dependencies ))
** Read the next record
** WHILE the record is a CUD_LINE
** 	write the dependency to ii_abfdependencies
** 	read the next record
** ENDLOOP
**
** One issue that crops up is what happends if we hit EOF while we're reading
** things in. The rule of thumb followed is if EOF occurs in the middle of 
** a definition (i.e, after a title record has been read in), its an error;
** however, if we hit EOF when we'd normally find a "dummy" dependency record,
** its not an error. 
**
** Inputs:
**	IEOBJREC        *objrec		object info for RECORD being processed
**	i4              appid		application id record belongs to
**	char            *appowner	owner of said application
**	char            *inbuf		ptr to buffer (holds 1 line from file)
**	FILE            *fp		file ptr to intermediate file
**     
** Outputs:
**	char            *inbuf		next line in file after record def
**	FILE            *fp		file ptr to above file
**	
** History:
** 	15-sep-1993 (daver)
**		First Documented, cleansed, er-msgized, etc.
**	26-jan-1994 (daver)
**		If we're updating the record structure, make sure the
**		existing dependenies are deleted before more are inserted.
**		Fixes bug 58570.
