/*{
** Name: IIIEdoc_DeleteOldComponent      - delete existing catalog entry
**
** Description:
**	This routine is needed to remove entries in catalogs where an
**	object is described via multiple rows. When the catalogs use a 1:1,
**	normalized mapping between rows and objects, we can simply update those
**	rows. But when multiple rows are stored per object, we need to delete
**	them all, and insert the new ones.
**
** Input:
**	IEOBJREC	*objrec		pointer to object (and id) to delete.
**	i4		appid		application id of object
**	i4		comptype	type of component it is
**
** Output:
**	None
**
** Returns:
**	Whatever the status of the query in question returns.
**
** Side Effects:
**	Deletes the specified component from the appropriate catalog.
**
** History:
**	18-aug-1993 (daver)
**		First Written.
**	14-sep-1993 (daver)
**		Moved error message over to erie.msg, random cleanup shme.
