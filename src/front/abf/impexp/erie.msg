/**
** Name:        erie.msg -      iiimport/iiexport message definitions
**
** Description:
**      Defines messages for the iiimport and iiexport, that wacky set
**      of tools which allows users to copy application components around.
**
**      The comment block FOLLOWING each error message gets into the
**      Error Manual, as per the coding standards. To be marginally
**      consistent, comments regarding Message strings also follow the message.
**
** History:
**      25-aug-1993 (daver)
**              First Written.
**      05-oct-1993 (daver)
**              Added E_IE003C_No_param_value message; made a nicer
**              error message for E_IE0013_No_Such_App; changed usage
**              syntax to show -copysrc | -check; added error message
**      26-jan-1994 (daver)
**              Add slow message S_IE0040_No_Allflag_Object and error messages
**              E_IE0041_No_Specified_Object and E_IE0042_Nothing_Found
**              to fix bug 57685 (no error checking for non-existant
**              object in iiexport).
**      21-apr-1994 (connie) Bug #60399
**              Correct spelling for "specified" in S_IE0040_No_Allflag_Object
**      27-oct-1994 (slawrence) Bug #60689
**              Added message E_IE0044_Dupl_File_Name for intfile and listing 
**              command line flags.

** Explanation:
**      This error occurs in IIMPORT when either creating the listing file,

** Explanation:
**      The user is trying to import a frame or procedure of the same
