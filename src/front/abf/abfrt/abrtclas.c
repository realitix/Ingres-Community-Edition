**
** History:
**	Revision 6.3/03/00  89/10  billc
**	Initial revision.
**	90/09  wong  Corrected memory allocation.  Bug #33263.
**	11/14/90 (emerson)
**		Created function iiarIarIsArray for bugs 34438 and 34440.
**	11/27/90 (emerson)
**		Added function iiarCtdTagsetDbdv (for bug 34663).
**	01/13/91 (emerson)
**		Fix bug 34845 (function iiarArAllCount).
**	03/23/91 (emerson)
**		Added function iiarRiRecordInfo (for look_up array support).
**	07-jun-91 (davel)
**		Fix bug 37412 (return OK status from iiarArClearArray)
**
**	Revision 6.4/02
**	10/13/91 (emerson)
**		Fix for bug 37109 in IIARoasObjAssign.
**	10/14/91 (emerson)
**		Fix for bug 40284 in IIARdotDotRef.
**	11/07/91 (emerson)
**		Revamped array processing for bugs 39581, 41013, and 41014:
**
**		Boiled down the C_OBJ (complex object) structure.
**		Created the R_OBJ (record object) structure
**		and the A_OBJ (array object) structure.  Use an array
**		of pointers to array elements instead of a linked list.
**		Modified appropriate routines to maintain and use
**		revised data structures.
**
**		Made significant enhancements to memory management:
**		Use a separate memory tag for each unnested local array.
**		Maintain free lists of records of various sizes
**		for each unnested array; add removed array rows
**		to the appropriate free list.  Implemented a reference count
**		scheme for records, arrays, and memory pools (one per tag)
**		to prevent dangling references in the event that a called frame
**		or procedure clears an array (or removes some of its rows).
**
**		Also made source code format consistent: added braces
**		around single-statement IF and ELSE clauses; removed spaces
**		directly inside parentheses (except for function definitions
**		and cases where the matching parenthesis is on a different line)
**
**		Created iiarCnfEnterFrame and iiarCffFreeFields.
**		Created IIARroReleaseObj and IIARareArrayEndUnload.
**		Deleted the function iiarCtdTagsetDbdv (no longer used).
**		Deleted no-op functions iiarCifInitFields and iiarCffFreeFields.
**		Created and deleted sundry internal functions.
**		Virtually every function was modified (at least cosmetically).
**
**		Changed the order of the functions to be a bit more logical
**		(and to match the order in the list of functions above).
**	16-sep-92 (davel/emerson)
**		Fixed bug 46625 - Do not issue rlsObj until after
**		decrementing the reference count. Changes made in 
**		IIARroReleaseObj(), IIARdotDotRef(), and IIARarrArrayRef().
**	19-feb-93 (davel)
**		Fixed bug 49120 - save the record type in the db_prec member
**		of the DB_DATA_VALUE as part of the iiarCidInitDbdv() process.
**		Then there will always be a safe way to type-check input
**		parameters when calling a static frame.
**	12-feb-93 (essi)
**		Fixed bug 49512 per emerson's suggestions.
**
**	Revision 6.5
**
**	22-dec-92 (davel)
**		Added argument to iiarCcnClassName() for EXEC 4GL support.
**	28-dec-92 (davel)
**		Made static getAttr() global, and renamed to IIARgtaGetAttr().

**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**      29-Nov-1999 (hanch04)
**          First stage of updating ME calls to use OS memory management.
**          Make sure me.h is included.  Use SIZE_TYPE for lengths.
**	13-Jan-2005 (kodse01)
**	    replace %ld with %d for old long nat variables.
**	24-Aug-2009 (kschendel) 121804
**	    Update some of the function declarations to fix gcc 4.3 problems.
**	17-May-2011 (kschendel) b125366
**	    Use %d and not %ld for i4's.  i8's need %lld.  Only native
**	    "long" uses %ld.  Fortunately this was for tracing only.

**	Currently, the only such information is a pool header (for local complex
**	objects outside arrays) and information r.e. UNLOADTABLEs for arrays.
**
**	The following points should be noted regarding UNLOADTABLEs for arrays:
**
**	(1) At most one UNLOADTABLE may be active within a single frame or
**	    procedure at any given time.  [This is enforced by the compiler:
**	    UNLOADTABLEs may not be lexically nested, and no 4GL mechanism
**	    other than CALLFRAME or CALLPROC is provided for "performing"
**	    a "lexically remote" group of 4GL statements.]
**	(2) Multiple UNLOADTABLEs of arrays may be concurrently active
**	    (in different frames or procedures in the call stack).
**	    [This is not true of UNLOADTABLEs of table fields].
**	    We don't explicitly document whether multiple UNLOADTABLEs of arrays
**	    may be concurrently active, but it has historically worked.
**	(3) We explicitly document that it's illegal to insert or delete
**	    rows in an array that's being unloaded.  However, we've never
**	    enforced this, and in fact we've handled these situations
**	    sensibly.  Therefore, we should probably continue to do so.
**	    [This means that fe_UnldRownum in one or more FRAME_ELT structures
**	    may require adjustment when a row is inserted or deleted].
**	(4) For an ENDLOOP out of an UNLOADTABLE of an array, the compiler
**	    used to generate no code to clean up the UNLOADTABLE.
**	    Because we must support existing imaged applications in shared
**	    segment environments such as VMS, the ABF RTS may not know
**	    that an UNLOADTABLE has terminated until the frame or procedure
**	    exits, or until another UNLOADTABLE is started.  This is why
**	    we need to keep track of which frame or procedure each
**	    UNLOADTABLE is associated with.  [If we always got control
**	    when an UNLOADTABLE terminated, we could just push an
**	    UNLOADTABLE element when an UNLOADTABLE loop starts, and pop it
**	    when the UNLOADTABLE loop ends].

**	The DB_DATA_VALUE is the dbdv in the frame's stack.
**	Its db_data pointer points to the record's data area.
**	At the beginning of the data area is the record's C_OBJ,
**	which describes the complex object (in this case, the record).
**	The C_OBJ points to the ABRTSTYPE, which describes the class.

**
**	As you can see, arrays are considerably more complex than records.
**
**	The example above shows an array with three attributes.
**	The array contains two non-deleted rows (rows 1 and 2),
**	and two deleted rows (rows -1 and 0).  Note: within structures
**	and arrays, storage addresses are depicted upside-down; that is,
**	with low addresses at the top.
**
**	The DB_DATA_VALUE is the dbdv in the frame's stack (as for a record).
**	Its db_data pointer, however, points to the array's A_OBJ.
**	At the beginning of the A_OBJ is the array's C_OBJ,
**	which is a model for the C_OBJ in each of the elements of the array.
**	[Note that a complex object's DB_DATA_VALUE.db_data pointer
**	can be thought of as a pointer to a C_OBJ structure, regardless of
**	whether the complex object is a record or an array].
**
**	The elements of the array are in fact just records.
**	They (the elements) are accessed via an array of pointers.
**	This pointer array initially contains a small number of slots;
**	it's doubled in size every time it overflows.  (The initial number
**	of slots is enough to fill one array row; this enables old, outgrown
**	pointer arrays to be reused as rows).  The pointer array contains
**	pointers to non-deleted records, followed by free pointer slots,
**	followed by pointers to deleted records.  The A_OBJ structure contains
**	a pointer to the *last* (top) slot in the pointer array;
**	it also contains a pointer to the "base" of the pointer array.
**	This base pointer actually points to the "-1" pointer
**	(off in the ozone); this simplifies pointer arithmetic.
**
** Memory mangagement:
**
**	'iiarCidInitDbdv()' initializes an individual object.
**	If the object is local, the current tag is used.
**	Each frame or procedure starts a tag block (see "abrtcall.qsc")
**	that is freed when it returns; this frees the local objects.
**	Otherwise, if the object is global (it's only initialized once
**	in an application), then memory is allocated using a tag allocated
**	in 'iiarCicInitClass()'.  This will never be freed.
**
**	Unnested arrays are special, however, in that memory for their rows
**	is allocated using a special tag so that they can be freed when cleared.
**	Local arrays are freed just before the frame or procedure returns.
**
**	Each unnested array has one or more free lists associated with it.
**	When a row of such an array is removed, it's added to a free list.
**	If and when a row is subsequently inserted into the array, memory
**	for it will be obtained from the free list.  If the free list
**	is empty, an MEreqlng will be issued to replenish it.
**	[Unless the rows are quite large, the MEreqlng will typically get
**	memory for more than one row.  For any given free list, the MEreqlng's
**	start out small; each new MEreqlng is about 1.5 times as big
**	as the previous until a fairly large ceiling is reached - see
**	the defines for MIN_INITIAL_POOL_Q_REQMEM and MAX_RECOMMENDED_REQMEM.]
**
**	An unnested array that contains nested records or arrays has more than
**	one free list: there's one for each record size that can occur within
**	the array.  [The sizes are rounded up to 8 or 16 - see the define for
**	POOL_Q_HDR_SIZE].  All arrays nested within the unnested array share
**	its memory pool.  When a nested array is cleared, its rows (and any
**	nested records or arrays) are added to the appropriate free list(s).
**
**	When a record contains a nested record, space for the nested record
**	is not obtained when the parent record is allocated: it's deferred until
**	the nested record is referenced.  If the record is part of an array,
**	space will be obtained from a free list (if possible), as discussed
**	above.  If the record is *not* part of an array, a separate FEreqlng
**	is issued for it; no free lists are maintained for objects outside
**	arrays.  There are a couple of reasons for this:  First, not many
**	records of the same size are likely to be allocated outside arrays.
**	Second, the chances are that the free lists would stay empty, because
**	the only 4GL language construct that can clear a record outside an
**	an array is a SELECT into a record (CLEARROW, as the name implies,
**	is strictly for rows of arrays).
**
** Reference counts:
**
**	Prior to 6.4/02, ABF/4GL did not maintain reference counts
**	for complex objects.  I (emerson) have introduced them because
**	they appear to be the only reasonably efficient way of preventing
**	certain user errors from causing (possibly silent) memory or data
**	corruption.
**
**	The sorts of user errors that need to be guarded against
**	are situations where a called frame or procedure removes a row
**	from an array, but the calling frame or procedure is about
**	to put something into the row (or take something out).
**	For example, suppose that calling procedure P with argument
**	arg1 set to "a" removes row i from array a.  Then without
**	reference counts, all of the following constructs are hazardous:
**
**	(1)	r = a[i].b + P(arg1 = a);
**	(2)	r = P(arg1 = a) + a[i].b;
**	(3)	a[i].b = P(arg1 = a);
**	(4)	r = P(arg1 = a, arg2 = byref(a[i].b));
**
**	In fact, (1) would probably work [whereas (2) wouldn't]
**	because expressions are in fact evaulated from left to right.
**	But users shouldn't count on any particular order of evaluation.
**
**	The remaining cases cause trouble because the l-value of a[i].b
**	is computed before P is called.  [That may not be obvious in (2);
**	but ABF/4GL in fact computes the l-values of all simple variables
**	and of all rows and/or attributes of complex variables (e.g. a[i].b)
**	in an expression before it even starts to evaluate the expression].
**
**	[Aside: prior to 6.4/02, the only case where trouble could actually
**	occur was when an unnested global array was cleared.  That's because
**	clearing any other sort of array, or removing a row in any array,
**	didn't cause memory to be freed (or marked for re-use).]
**
**	Reference counts prevent dangling references from occurring
**	in situations like those above:  The 4GL compiler now will
**	generate IL to bump necessary reference counts before doing
**	a CALLPROC or CALLFRAME, and to decrement them after the reference
**	to the object.  In the examples above, assuming that "b" is a
**	*simple* attribute of "a", the compiler computes the l-value of a[i]
**	and leaves it in a temp (the l-value of a[i].b now goes into a
**	different temp).  The IL_ARRAYREF instruction that put the l-value
**	of a[i] into its temp has a modifier bit set that will cause
**	IIARarrArrayRef to bump a[i]'s reference count.  After all the IL
**	to evaluate and assign the expression, the compiler generates
**	an IL_RELEASEOBJ instruction to "release" a[i].  A "release" of a[i]
**	was also done when P removed it, but all that release did was to
**	decrement a[i]'s reference count.  But when the IL_RELEASEOBJ
**	is executed, a[i]'s reference count is down to 1, and so it's
**	actually freed (added to a free list).
**
**	Reference counts are also used for entire memory pools:  we mustn't
**	free the memory associated with an unnested array if there are any
**	references into the array from outside it.  Rather than examining
**	the reference counts of all the rows in an unnested array
**	[and recursively examining the reference counts of nested objects],
**	we maintain a special reference counter for each unnested array
**	that represents the number of "dangerous" references into the array
**	from outside it.  [A reference isn't dangerous if we know it will
**	go away before any "clear" of the array].  If an unnested array
**	is cleared when there are still references into it from outside,
**	the "clear" is implemented as it would be if the array were nested:
**	all the array's rows are released, and wherever a release of an
**	object actually results in the object being freed, any objects
**	nested in the freed object are recursively released.
**
**	ABF/4GL programs compiled using an old (pre-6.4/02) compiler
**	will not generate code to explicitly hold or release objects;
**	when such programs are executed by the new ABF runtime, a complex
**	object inside an array will generally has a reference count of 1,
**	until a row containing it is removed, or an array containing it is
**	cleared, at which point it will be freed.  An array memory pool
**	will generally has a reference count of 0.  The only exception
**	occurs on an unloadtable: the current unloaded row will have
**	a reference count of 2, and its memory pool will have a reference
**	count of 1.  These will be decremented at exit from the unloadtable
**	*unless* the exit was done via an endloop.  In that case, the
**	reference counts will stay bumped, and the last unloaded row
**	is in effect permanent (although if the array is local, it will
**	all go away when its defining frame terminates - see below).
**
**	Memory pools associated with local arrays defined
**	in a particular frame are freed when the frame terminates.
**	This is safe because ABF/4GL provides no language constructs
**	for placing the address of a complex object into another object,
**	or passing the address of a local complex object back to a calling
**	routine.  We don't bother checking the pool's reference count:
**	if the frame (and all frames it calls) were compiled with a new
**	compiler, the reference count should be zero at this point,
**	and if they weren't all compiled with a new compiler, the reference
**	count can't be trusted anyway.
**
** Error Handling:
**
**	Error handling is stringent here.  When this module was originally
**	implemented, there was no dependency-checking of classes,
**	so someone could easily run a frame with IL code
**	that was out-of-date with respect to the class definition.
**	Error handling had to be thorough and graceful.
**
**	In handling a DOT error, we can assume that the frame is out of date,
**	and exit the frame.
**
**	An ARRAY error, if it's a bad index, is a user error and we must
**	recover; we direct the array reference to a special initialized row
**	(the "dummy" row).  If necessary, we'll allocate it and initialize it.

** Name:	IIARdotDotRef() -	resolve a DOT reference.

** Description:
**	Executes the core of the DOT command, resolving a object-membership
**	reference.
**
**	The 4GL code
**
**		X.Y[I].z
**
**	Becomes IL code
**
**		DOT 	Xobj "Y" tmp 	-- tmp now holds the x.y object
**		ARRAY	tmp Iexpr tmp	-- tmp holds the i'th element of x.y.
**		DOT	tmp "z"	tmp
**
**	'tmp' then holds the value of x.y[i].z.  The db_data pointer points into
**	the object's data area, so assignments work appropriately.
**
**	The 'tmp' object only gets its db_data pointer twiddled.  The 'tmp'
**	was allocated with the type of the value that finally goes into it.
**	So if z is an integer attribute of Y, 'tmp' is DB_INT_TYPE.  When we
**	finally DOT into a scalar, we check the datatypes for legitimate
**	matchup.
**
** Inputs:
**	src 	{DB_DATA_VALUE *} Dbv holding an object.
**	mname	{char *}	  Name of the object attribute.
**	targ 	{DB_DATA_VALUE *} Dbv to dereference into.
**	flags	{nat}		  Any combination of the following:
**				  ILM_HOLD_TARG: bump targ's reference count.
**				  ILM_RLS_SRC: release src (decrement its ref
**				  count, or free it if ref count is 1).
**				  1: (only for UNLOADTABLE),
**				  instead of just twiddling targ's db_data,
**				  the result is copied to targ
**				  (its db_data pointer is unchanged);
**				  data is type-coerced, if necessary.
**				  The caller must not specify this flag
**				  if either targ is of type DB_DMY_TYPE.
**
** Returns:
**	STATUS	-- OK on success.

** History:
**	10/89 (billc) - written.

**		Fix for bug 40284: Always do an assign if the 4th parm is TRUE.
**		Before, if a variable specified to receive an attribute
**		on an UNLOADTABLE statement had the same type as the attribute,
**		then it (the variable) was simply made to point to the
**		attribute.  This caused havoc.
**	11/07/91 (emerson)
