/**
** Name:    rtsdata.c -	ABF Run-Time System Global Data Definitions File.
**
** Description:
**	These are declarations of the global variables used
**	in the runtime system.
**
**	The runtime system is used in both the definition stage and
**	the executable image.
**
** History:
**	12/19/89 (dkh) - VMS shared lib changes.  Added IIar_Dbname and
**			 IIar_Status so references to IIarDbname and IIarStatus
**			 can be vectorized.
**	10/14/90 (dkh) - Moved IIar_Dbname and IIar_Status to abf!abmain.c
**			 so they are not exported across shared library
**			 interface for both VMS and UNIX.  Access to
**			 IIarDbname and IIarStatus are sent back by
**			 calls to IIARgadGetArDbname() and IIARgasGetArStatus().
**	03/26/91 (emerson)
**		Added IIarBatch (for "non-forms-mode" support).
**	06-nov-92 (davel)
**		Added IIarNoDB (to support applications running without a 
**		DB connection).
**	12-nov-92 (davel)
**		Added IIARsadSetArDbname() to set/clear IIarDbname.
**       6-oct-93 (donc)
**		Added IIARgarArRtsprm() to allow access to globaldef
**		IIarRtspr	 
**	 7-oct-93 (donc)
**		Moved IIarRtsprm and IIARgarArRtsprm to their own
**		file ildata.c. 
**	29-oct-1993 (mgw) Bug #49551
**		Add abfrtlib Global, IIarUserApp, for determining whether
**		we're in a user application or not in iiarFormInit()
**		(and elsewhere if needed).
**      24-sep-96 (hanch04)
**              Global data moved to data.c
**	19-apr-1999 (hanch04)
**	    Added st.h
