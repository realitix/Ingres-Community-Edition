**
** Description:
**	Defines messages for the copy application utility, COPYAPP.
**
** History:
**	Revision 6.0  10-aug-1987 (Joe)
**	Initial Version.
**	02-nov-89 (marian)
**		Replace "Technical Support Representative" with "Site
**		Technical Contact".
**	23-oct-1990 (mgw)
**		Corrected some misspellings. All are in comments, not messages,
**		but these comments get picked up for the messages.txt file via
**		erxtract and are thus in a deliverable.
**	14-nov-1990 (blaise)
**		Change text of E_CA000C_BADFLAG, removing usage message; add
**		a new message S_CA0026_Correct_syntax to be displayed after
**		E_CA000C_BADFLAG or E_CA000A_DIRECTION. (bug 34312).
**	26-jul-93 (blaise)
**		Added F_CA0005_Application, to replace literal string in
**		caout.sc.
**      20-Jun-2005 (hanal04) Bug 114700 INGSRV3337
**              Ingres message file cleanup.
