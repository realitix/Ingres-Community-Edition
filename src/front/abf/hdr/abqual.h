** Name:	ABRT_QFLD -	Associate Field with Column Attribute.
**
** Description:
**	Specifies an association between a DBMS column attribute and a field.
**	If the field contains a query, then this is the column attribute to
**	use with the query value.  An array of ABRT_QFLDs must always end with
**	an element containing NULL members.
**
**	For example:
**		ABRT_QFLD {"R.column", "field"}
**
**		The field 'fld' contains the following value: >10 or <2
**
**		The generated where clause is: R.column > 10 or R.column < 2
**
**	The ABRT_QUAL structure will contain an element that references the
**	array of ABRT_QFLD elements for a qualification.
