** Name:	erfg.msg -	Message file for class FG
**
** Description:
**	This file defines the messages for class FG.
**
** History:
**	 3-aug-1989 (bobm)
**		Created.
**	2/jan-1990 (pete)	Tried to make it clear in all messages that
**				the error occurred during 4gl code generation.
**				Also, added notes to internal errors, that
**				user should try to narrow down what caused the
**				internal error, before calling Tech Supt.
**	23-oct-1990 (mgw)
**		Corrected a misspelling in a message.
**	24-jul-92 (blaise)
**		Added F_FG003E_Before_Lookup, F_FG003F_After_Lookup,
**		F_FG0041_On_Timeout, F_FG0042_On_Dbevent,
**		F_FG0043_Table_Field_Menuitems and F_FG0044_Menuline_Menuitems,
**		all new Vision escape code types.
**	13-aug-92 (blaise)
**		Added F_FG0045 and F_FG0046: local procedure messages.
**	6-dec-92 (blaise)
**		Added F_FG0047_OptLkHidFldComnt - comment for optmistic locking
**		fields.
**	09-sep-93 (cmr)
**		Made F_FG0031_HidnKeyFldComment more generic since hidden flds
**		are generated for all sorts of reasons (seq flds, optimistic 
**		locking, lookups, etc) and not just for primary keys and joins.

E_FG0001_Unknown_VQ_Var	"Error occurred while generating 4gl code\n
Found bad Visual Query variable in ##IF stmt\n
An error occurred trying to generate 4gl code for this frame.
The ##IF statement on line %0d of template file '%1c' contains a
reference to '%2c',
which is either an unknown Visual Query variable, or is a Visual Query
variable that does not evaluate to TRUE or FALSE (only boolean Visual
Query variables may be used in ##IF statements). This is an error in your
template file; correct the template file '%1c' before trying to generate
4gl again."

E_FG0002_IfStmt_Nesting  "Error occurred while generating 4gl code\n
An error occurred trying to generate 4gl code for this frame.
##IF/##IFDEF/##ENDIF blocks may only be nested up to %0d levels deep.
Line %1d of template file '%2c' contains a ##IF or ##IFDEF statement which,
if executed, would have exceeded this limit. This is an error in your template
file; correct the template file '%2c' before trying to generate 4gl again."

E_FG0003_Mismatch_ElseEndif	"Error occurred while generating 4gl code\n
Template file error: mismatched ##ELSE or ##ENDIF.
An error occurred trying to generate 4gl code for this frame.
On line %0d of template file '%1c', a ##ELSE or ##ENDIF statement was
encountered that does not match any previous ##IF or ##IFDEF statement.
This is an error in your template file; correct the template file '%1c'
before trying to generate 4gl again."

E_FG0004_Too_Many_Elses	"Error occurred while generating 4gl code\n
Template file error: too many ##ELSE stmts found.
Line %0d of template file '%1c' contains a duplicate ##ELSE statement. A
##ELSE statement has already been seen for the previous ##IF/##IFDEF statement,
so this duplicate ##ELSE is an error in the template file '%1c'. Correct the
template file before trying to generate 4gl again."

##INCLUDE statements nested too deep.
An error occurred generating 4gl code for this frame. The statement
'##INCLUDE %0c' was encountered, and cannot be processed, because that
would exceed the limit of %1d levels deep in ##INCLUDE file processing. Often
an infinite loop in your ##INCLUDE file processing will cause this error (for
example if file1 does '##INCLUDE file2', and file2 does '##INCLUDE file1',
then an infinite loop will occur). Check your template files for an
infinite loop in ##INCLUDE statements, or ##INCLUDE statements nested more
than %1d levels deep."

E_FG0008_TooMany_Endifs	"Error occurred while generating 4gl code\n
Excessive number of ##ENDIF statements found.
An error occurred generating 4gl code for this frame. On line %0d of template
file '%1c', a ##ENDIF statement was found that does not match up with any
preceding ##IF or ##IFDEF statement. This is an error in the template file
and should be corrected before proceeding."

E_FG0009_Unclosed_IfStmt	"Error occurred while generating 4gl code\n
##ENDIF missing for ##IF or ##IFDEF in template file.
An error occurred generating 4gl code for this frame. Template file
'%0c' has an error: it contains at least one ##IF or ##IFDEF statement that
is not closed by a corresponding ##ENDIF statement in the same file. This is an
error in the template file and should be corrected before proceeding. If
you don't know how to correct an error in a template file, then contact
your Site Technical Contact for assistance."
