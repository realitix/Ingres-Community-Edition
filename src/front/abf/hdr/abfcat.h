**	23-mar-1992 (mgw) Bug #36595 a.k.a. 41188
**		Changed ABFILSIZE in abfrt.h and found that it was
**		referenced in 2 obsolete structures here, ABCATRW, and
**		ABCATGBF. Since these aren't used anywhere, delete them.
**		That led me to check other structures here and find they
**		should be yanked too.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4

** BUG 1793
** Changing source directory didn't cause the locations for the sfile
** to be changed.  Now, sfiles don't have a location, they are built
** on the fly.  fisdir points to the source directory, and abfilscr
** builds a location of references to the source file.
**
** Files for frames and OSL procedures can not be shared with other
** objects.  They contain a pointer to the frame of procedure they
** belong to.
