** Description:
**	This file defines the METAFRAME structure and its

**	This set of structures supports the elements necessary to

**
** History:
**	12/14/88 (tom) - created
**	09/27/89 (tom) - removed the modify and display frame types
**	21-aug-92 (blaise)
**		Increased MF_MAXESCS from 50 to 100 (SIR #44985)
**	6-dec-92 (blaise)
**		Added support for optimistic locking; see history for MFCOL
**		and METAFRAME structures, below.
**      23-feb-93 (connie) Bug #43375
