/**
** Name:    abfosl.h -	ABF Run-Time System OSL Interface Definitions File.
**
** Description:
**	Contains the declarations of the objects defined by the ABF run-time
**	system to support OSL features.
**
**	IMPORTANT NOTE:
**		The structures declared here are also declared in
**		oslhdr.h which is in the ingres/files directory.
**		Any changes to structures here must be reflected
**		in that file.  Also, some of these structures
**		are built into users' ABF applications, so changes to
**		them have to account for compatibility with USERS'
**		applications.
** 		DO NOT change the structures or constants declared
**		here without checking with OSL development.
**
** History:
**	Revision 6.4/03
**	09/20/92 (emerson)
**		Defined new constant QR_VERSION to take the place of
**		QG_VERSION when setting/testing the qr_version field
**		of the QRY structure.  Also added defines to allow
**		using the high-order 24 bits of qr_version as flags.
**		Note that none of these need be defined in oslhdr.h.
**		(A name like "qr_flags" would now make more sense than
**		"qr_version", but I didn't want to mess with the backward
**		compatibility issues in oslhdr.h).
**
**	Revision 6.4
**	03/23/91 (emerson)
**		Changed type of qr_argv in QRY structure from (QRY_ARGV (*)[])
**		to (QRY_ARGV *), which matches the declaration in oslhdr.h,
**		and appears to be the real type: Code in abfrt and interp
**		that referenced qr_argv was casting it to (QRY_ARGV *);
**		this will no longer be necessary.
**
**	Revision 6.3/03/01
**	02/17/91 (emerson)
**		Defined new constant PR_VERSION to take the place of
**		FD_VERSION when setting/testing the pr_version field
**		of the ABRTSPRM structure (for bug 35946 - see fdesc.h).
**		Note that PR_VERSION need not be defined in oslhdr.h.
**
**	Revision 6.0  87/07  arthur
**	Added new query structure for 6.0.
**
**	Revision 5.1  86/08  arthur
**	Changed some nat's back to i4's.  As noted above, this
**		file MUST remain consistent with oslhdr.h.
**		Note also that nat's and i4's ARE different on the PC.
**		8/14/86 (agh)
**
**	Revision 3.0  84/02/13  joe
**	Initial revision.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
