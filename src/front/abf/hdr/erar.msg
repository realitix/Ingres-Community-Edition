E_AR0000_NOSUCHDB       "Error connecting to database `%0c'."

/*%
** Explanation:
**      The application could not successfully connect to the named database

**      the commands specified using the ING_SET environment logical are
**      incorrect.
**
**      Occasionally, successful database connection may be precluded by
**      other errors (e.g., GCA errors, etc.) usually evidence of some sort
**      of installation problem or hardware or system failure.
**
** System Status:
**      The application will not start up.
**
** User Action:
**      Check that the database name was specified correctly and re-enter
**      the command line.  Also, check that the commands specified using
**      the ING_SET logical are correct.

E_AR0007_ABNULLPRM      "Possible Null value passed to non-Null parameter.\n
A value of Nullable type was passed to the parameter `%2c', which is not
Nullable, in the %1c `%0c'.  This will result in a run-time error when a Null
value is passed to this parameter.  Use the 'ifnull()' function when passing
this value to ensure that a run-time error will not occur."

/*%
** Explanation:
**      A value of a Nullable type is being passed to a parameter that has been
**      declared as being not Nullable.  Passing a Null value to this parameter

**      you can use the 'ifnull()' function to pass it, which will guarantee

**
** System Status:
**      If the value is not Null, it will be passed to the parameter; otherwise
**      a run-time error will occur and the parameter will be undefined.

E_AR0008_ABNULLBYREF    "Possible Null value returned by reference.\n
The parameter `%0c' is a Nullable type in the current %1c and is being returned
by reference to a non-Nullable field.  This will result in a run-time error when
a Null value is returned by reference to this field.  Define the parameter to
be non-Nullable to ensure that a run-time error will not occur."

**      a run-time error will occur and the value of the field will be

E_AR000E_ABNULLOBJ      "Undefined routine for %1c `%0c'.\n
The internal ABF run-time structures contain a NULL reference for the routine
for the %1c `%0c'.  Please report this internal problem to your Site Technical
Contact."

/*%
** Explanation:
**      The ABF run-time system found a NULL reference to a routine in its
**      internal structures when the application tried to call or run an
**      INGRES/4GL frame or procedure.  (This routine contains the executable
**      code for the frame or procedure.)  ABF should generate a symbol for
**      this routine, both in the internal run-time structures that it builds
**      and in the code generated for the frame or procedure, when an
**      application is built.  Otherwise, this is an internal programming
**      problem.
**
**      In versions before release 6, this error could occur when the source
**      files for a frame and a procedure shared a common file name but had
**      different extensions (e.g., "xyz.osl" and "xyz.c".)  Then, the resultant
**      object files would collide, most likely overwriting the code for the
**      frame's routine.  ABF guarantees that this cannot occur in release 6
**      applications by not allowing files to be specified for frames or
**      procedures that share a common file name.
**
** System Status:
**      The called frame will not be run.
**
** User Action:
**      Report this problem to your site technical contact.

E_AR000F_RETTYPE        "Incompatible return type.\n
The %1c `%0c' returns a value of type `%2c' that is not compatible

/*%
** Explanation:
**      A return value from a frame or procedure did not agree in type with the
**      expected type.  That is, the type of the return value is not compatible
**      with (coercible to) the expected type declared for the frame or

**
** System Status:

An error occurred when the ABF run-time system tried to evaluate an expression.

** Explanation:
**      The parameters to the look-up frame did not specify all the columns to

"The record length for Binary file '%0c' has not been provided yet.

being calculated as an absolute value from the beginning of the file.

OpenFile statement or implicity via a ReadFile or WriteFile request."

** Explanation:
**
** System Status:
**      The resultant Offset or Recordnum value is returned.            n
**      Normal execution continues, but the values being returned for
**      the Binary file may not be the absolute values, as calculated
**      from the beginning of the file, that the program expects.
**
** User Action:
**      Ensure that for Binary files the record length has been provided
**      either explicitly on the OpenFile statement or implicitly via   h
**      a ReadFile or WriteFile statement before requesting InquireFile.
