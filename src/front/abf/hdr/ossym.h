/**
** Name:	ossym.h -	OSL Parser Symbol Table Definitions File.
**
** Description:
**	This file contains the definition of the structure of the symbol table
**	entries.  Entries in the symbol table are hashed on the symbol name.
**	(Manipulation of the hash table is private to ossym.c).
**	All fields and columns are hashed and lookup must be done based on the
**	name and the parent.  For example, given the form
**
**		emp
**			name = c20
**			salary = i2
**			child = table field
**				name = c20
**
**	The symbols "emp", "name", "salary", "child", and "name" are
**	all placed in the symbol table.  Obviously "name" from "emp" and
**	"name" from "child" would hash to the same location, so the lookup
**	is differentiated by their parents.
**
**	The symbols are linked into lists so that each parent points
**	to list(s) of its children, and each child points to its parent.
**	(Certain kinds of parents partition their children into disjoint
**	groups; such a parent has a separate list for each group).
**
**	Note that all lists of symbol table entries are maintained as stacks;
**	i.e. new entries are added to the beginning of the list, so the list
**	is in ascending order by age.  All such lists are null-terminated.
**
**	Not all symbols need be placed on a hash list.  (Temporaries aren't).
**
**	Every symbol that *is* placed on a hash list must have a parent.
**
** History:
**	Revision 6.4/03
**	09/20/92 (emerson)
**		Added s_tmpseq and OS_TMPFROZEN (for bug 34846).
**
**	Revision 6.4/02
**	10/03/91 (emerson)
**		Added s_block and removed OS_LABELACT flag from s_ref
**		(for bugs 34788, 36427, 40195, 40196).
**	11/07/91 (emerson)
**		Added s_tmpil (for bugs 39581, 41013, and 41014).
**
**	Revision 6.4
**	04/07/91 (emerson)
**		Revisions for local procedures.  Also took the opportunity
**		to simplify the structure (e.g. get rid of elaborate unions),
**		although there are still many #define's, for historical reasons.
**
**		Some noteworthy changes:
**		(1) An OSFORM symbol can now represent a local procedure
**		    as well as a frame's form or a main procedure.
**		    (The name OSFORM is misleading, but it's retained
**		    for historical reasons; the term "form" is used throughout
**		    the comments in the OSL directory to represent a "scope":
**		    a set of fields, variables, constants, etc. belonging
**		    to a frame or procedure).  In addition to "topological"
**		    information (lists of children), the OSFORM symbol now 
**		    contains information about the frame/procedure return type
**		    and some information used by ILG.
**		(2) The member s_brightness has been added.
**		(3) The member s_const has been removed (it was unused).
**		(4) The member s_consts has also been removed; application
**		    constants are now on the same list as variables.
**		(5) The size of a table entry has increased from 44 to 60 bytes
**		    (assuming 4-byte nat's and pointers and "natural" alignment)
**		    If this is a problem, we could split some of the OSFORM
**		    stuff off into separate entries, but this complicates things
**
**	Revision 6.0  87/01/24  wong
**	Moved attribute, table field info., etc. to OSNODE structure.
**	Added OSCONSTANT symbol node.
**
**	Revision 5.1  86/10/17  16:35:15  wong
**	Added subscript reference field.
**	Declare only symbol table functions.
**	Added reference for intermediate language.
**
**	Revision 3.0  84/04  joe
**	Initial revision.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	24-Aug-2009 (kschendel) 121804
