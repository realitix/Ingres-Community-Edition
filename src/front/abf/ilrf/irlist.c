/**
** Name:	irlist.c - ILRF list utilities
**
** Description:
**	This file defines several small routines to manipulate
**	the frame information lists.  Only used from within ILRF.
**
**	The lists are doubly linked and circular.  ILRF code should pass through
**	these utilities to do anything which adds, removes or
**	rearranges frame information lists.  Callers may directly
**	scan the lists.  Lists are refered to by QUEUE structures
**	maintaining the head and tail of the list.
**
**	This file hides the list pool for IR_F_CTL nodes.  All passed in
**	arguments are legitimate list members.	list_add is the only legal
**	way to add a list element, and it explicitly chains it onto a list.
**	An unlinked pointer is no longer legal for anything.
**
**	The partioning of functionality in these routines may seem a bit
**	wierd - they are intended to be convenient for ILRF use, not as
**	generic list routines.
**
**	Routines:
**		list_add - add a new node to a list.
**		list_unlink - remove a node from a list.(in seperate file
**			for overlaying purposes)
**		list_swap - swap a node from one list to the other.
**		list_head - move a node to the head of its list.
**		list_tail - move a node to the tail of its list.
**		list_create - create a list.
**		list_zero - remove all nodes from a list.
**		list_free_pool - free the memory IIOR_Pool.
**
** History:
**	8/86 (rlm)	written
**	03/16/88 (dkh) - Added EXdelete call to conform to coding spec.

** from allocation failures, first setting a flag to indicate this action
** from the ME routines rather than a syserr().
