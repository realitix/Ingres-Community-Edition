This frame allows you to Archive the currently selected report to a text 
file.  You may archive reports created by RBF or through SREPORT.  
Archiving a report corresponds to the function performed by the COPYREP 
operating system command.

One useful function of archiving a report is to write out an RBF report
to a text file for further editing, and re-entry of the report using
SREPORT.  While these reports may no longer be edited using RBF, you
can often go beyond the power of RBF in developing customized reports.

The menu commands are:

        MENU COMMANDS   SYNOPSIS
