Save Form

     This form is used to save a new report or to edit Name, Short or
     Long Remarks for an existing report.  This form has the same appearance
     as the Catalog Details form, although the command menu is slightly
     different.  The Name field on this form may be modified, which will
     cause the current report, when saved, to be saved as a new report of
     the given name.  

     If a report, with the specified name, owned by either the current user 
     or the DBA, already exists in the database, you will be asked to confirm 
     your intention to save before proceeding.
