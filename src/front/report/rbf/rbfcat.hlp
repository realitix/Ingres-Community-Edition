This frame contains a table field listing all reports in the database
owned by you or by the DBA.  The Name field lists the report name.
The Owner field either lists your username, or "DBA" for reports owned
by the DBA.  The Short Remark field lists a user defined short remark
for the report, or "RBF" as the default short remark for a report created

From RBF, you may edit reports that were created with the RBF report layout 
editor.  Please note that you may not edit reports created by the 
Report Writer source statements, SREPORT.

                     existing RBF report, a table or a joindef.  Then you
                     will be prompted for the name of the existing RBF
                     report, table or joindef.  Once the name has been
                     entered, if this is based on a table or a joindef,
                     you are offered a selection of report styles for
                     further editing.

                     only destroy reports that you own.

                     created using RBF then the report layout frame will
                     be displayed.  If the report was created using Report
                     Writer statements then an error will be generated.

                     report layout editor, the table on which the report
                     is based, and the query language for the report.

                     can be produced.  You may choose the appropriate
                     style, after which the default report for the table
                     will be run.  You may display the report at the

     Utilities       Brings up a submenu of utility functions to perform
                     on the selected report.  From this submenu, you
                     may Archive the report to a text file.

     Go              Run the report.  You may run a default report, write 
		     the output to a file or send the output to a printer.
		     A default report will either send the report to the 
		     screen or a file depending on the presence of a 
		     .OUTPUT statement in the report.
