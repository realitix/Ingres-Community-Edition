This form contains options for the destination of a report.

The selections on the form are:

        SELECTION       DESCRIPTION
        ---------       -----------
        Default         Choosing default will either send the report to
                        the screen or a file depending on the presence
                        of a .OUTPUT statement in the report.  If a .OUTPUT
                        statement is present, the output will be sent to
                        the file specified in the statement, otherwise it
                        will be sent to the screen.  Only reports saved by
			SREPORT may have .OUTPUT statements.

        Printer         Choosing Printer will send the report to the printer.
                        You will be prompted for the printer name, the 
			desired number of copies of the report to be printed
			and if you would like to wait for the report to
			complete before continuing.  If a .OUTPUT statement 
			is present in the report, the report will also be 
			sent to the file specified in the statement.  Only 
			reports saved by SREPORT may have .OUTPUT statements.

        File            This selection will direct the output of the report 
                        to a specified file.  You will be prompted for the 
			file name and if you would like to wait for the 
			report to complete before continuing.  If the report 
			contained a .OUTPUT statement, the file name you 
			enter now will override the one in the report.  Only 
			reports saved by SREPORT may have .OUTPUT statements.
