Please specify the name of the file to contain the report output and if you
would like to wait for the report to complete execution.  You must enter a 
file name before executing the report from this popup.  

You also have the choice to either wait for the report to complete execution 
or not.  If you choose NOT to wait ('no'), your cursor will return promptly 
after starting the report execution.  You may then continue other functions 
within RBF while your report is running.  Since the report will be running in
non-interactive mode, ALL VARIABLES, IF ANY, MUST BE GIVEN VALUES before 
execution.  This is done on the Declared Variables Frame.  This frame will 
come up automatically if there are any declared variables that have a prompt
associated with them.  Before running any report in non-interactive mode, 
change any undeclared variables to declared (.DECLARE) variables.  Add the 
WITH PROMPT clause if necessary.  Refer to the Report-Writer Reference Manual 
for more information on declared variables.

Report Writer will prompt for a report log if you choose not to wait for
report completion.  The report statistics and any errors encountered during
execution will be sent to this file.

The fields on the popup are:

        FIELD           DESCRIPTION
        -----           -----------
        File Name	Name of the file to contain the report output.

	Wait for        If you enter 'yes' for this field, the report will
	report to       execute interactively.  All status messages and error 
	complete	messages, if any, will be displayed on the screen.  
			While testing and developing a report, it is advisable
			to run the report interactively.

			If you enter 'no', the report will run simultaneously 
			while you continue to run in RBF.  If there are any 
			declared variables in the report, the Declared 
			Variables Frame will prompt you to enter all variable 
			values before executing the report.  After the report 
			has been executed, check the report log to see if the 
			report executed successfully.

	Report Log      ** Only displayed when not waiting for the report to
			** complete execution.
			File name to send the report statistics and report 
			errors, if any, encountered during execution.
