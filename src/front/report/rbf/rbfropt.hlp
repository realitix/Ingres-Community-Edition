You may select options affecting the entire report.  For fields with a
choice of answers, ('yes/no', 'none/all/last'), you do not need to spell
out the full word.  Type in enough of the word to make it distinct from all 
the other choices.  

The options are:

        OPTION          DESCRIPTION
        ------          -----------
        Page Length     If left blank, the report writer will select an
                        appropriate default each time the report is run.
                        If you fill this in with a non-zero value, that
                        page length will be used each time the report 
			is executed.  A page length of 0 will suppress 
			all pagination in the report.

        Underline       If left blank, the report writer will select a
        Character       character appropriate for the device: underscore
                        (_) when reporting to a file or to a printer;
			dash (-) when reporting to a terminal.  If 
			you enter in a character, that character will 
			always be used.

	Print Page 	A yes/no response.  If you would like the 
 	Header on	information in the page header to also appear in 
	First Page	the report header then set this field to 'yes'.  
			This is useful if you want the top of every report 
			page to print the same information.  Otherwise 
			when set to 'no', the first page will only print 
			the contents of the report header.  The default is 
			'yes'.

        Null String     For the field titled 'Display Null Values as:'
                        enter the string which is to be displayed for each
                        output value that is null.  The default is a
                        blank string.

        Formfeeds       A yes/no response.  If 'no', formfeeds are 
			not automatically generated when the report is 
			executed.  If 'yes', formfeed characters are 
			inserted in the report at the end of each page.

        First           A yes/no response.  If 'no', the formfeed before
	Formfeed	the first page of the report will not be generated 
			when the report is executed.  If 'yes', the 
			first formfeed will be inserted in the report.
			The default is 'yes'.

        Underlining     For each of the sections, specify the underlining
                        style to use.  If 'all', then all lines in the 
			section will be underlined.  If 'last', then only 
			the last line in the section will be underlined, and 
			if 'none' then no underlining will be performed.
	
        Page            For 'Date', 'Time' and 'Page', enter a yes/no
        Component       response to indicate if it should be included in
                        the report.  If included, the components will appear
                        on each page:
                             Date - top left corner
                             Time - top right corner
                             Page - centered at the bottom of the page

                        If 'yes', you may then edit the format to your
                        preference.  The components expect the following
                        types of formats:
                             Date - date and/or time format or a character
                                    format
                             Time - date and/or time format or a character
                                    format
                             Page - numeric format
                        For more information on formats, please select
                        'SubTopics.'
