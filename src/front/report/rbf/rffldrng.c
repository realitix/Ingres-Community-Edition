/*
**   RFFLD_RNG - find the range of locations for the fields and
**	trim within a given section of the report.  This goes
**	through the list of trims and fields (regular and aggregate)
**	and figures out the minimum and maximum lines on which the 
**	components lie.  It also finds the first TRIM and FIELD 
**	structures within that section.
**
**	All of the arrays which are passed to this routine are
**	filled in by this routine.  Each are big enough to
**	hold all the fields (Cs_length).  Element 0 in 
**	each array is reserved for unassociated trim and fields.
**
**	Parameters:
**				will contain the minimum line
**				in this section which will contain
**		maxline		last line in section with a fld or trim
**		minfld		list of *FIELDs which will contain
**				pointers to the first FIELD encountered
**				in this section (important because they
**				are ordered).
**		mintrm		list of *TRIMs which will contain pointers
**				to the first trims encountered.
**		tline		top line in section.
**		bline		bottom line in section.
**		
**	Returns:
**		fills in arrays minfld, mintrm.  Sets maxline.
**
**	Called by:
**		rFm_sec.
**
**	Side Effects:
**		none.
**
**	Trace Flags:
**		186.
**
**	History:
**		10/16/82 (ps)	written.
**		10/21/83 (nml)  Put in GAC's fix for bug #1632 - now deleting
**				columns doesn't cause A.V.
**      	9/22/89 (elein)	UG changes ingresug change #90045
**				changed <rbftype.h> & <rbfglob.h> to "rbftype.h" 
**				& "rbfglob.h"
**		22-nov-89 (cmr)	Use Cs_length instead of En_n_attribs when
**				scanning the Cs_top array so that aggregates
**				get included too.
**		21-jul-90 (cmr)	fix for bug 31731
**				Make underlining work properly - set maxline
**				correctly.  Also removed minline - not needed.
**		04-dec-90 (steveh) corrected computation of *maxline so as to
**				fix bug 34298. *maxline must be the maximum over
**				*all* fields.  Bug 34298 was caused by the
**				fact that *maxline was incorrectly computed as
**				the maximum on the *last* field.
**	15-Nov-1993 (tad)
**		Bug #56449
**		Replace %x with %p for pointer values where necessary.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	24-Feb-2010 (frima01) Bug 122490
**	    Update return types and add header files as neccessary
**	    to eliminate gcc 4.3 warnings.
