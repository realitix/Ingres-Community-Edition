     All fields are display-only except for the Short and Long Remarks
     fields, which may be updated.  A "Save" command is provided on the menu
     to store any updated information in the database.  "Next" ("Previous")
     will show the Details frame for the report which appears after (before)
     the current report in the main catalog table field.  "Next" will advance
     to the top report of the catalog table field if the current report is
     the last one, and similarly for "Previous".
