You may specify print options for a break column in the detail section.  You
can decide when to print the break column and whether or not a pagefeed should
be generated when the break value changes.  The fields on this form accept
a value of "yes" or "no".  You do not need to spell out the full word.  Type
in enough of the word to make it distinct.

The options are:

        OPTION          DESCRIPTION
        ------          -----------
       	Always 		If the value of this field is "yes" then the break
			column will always be printed; duplicate values will 
			not be suppressed.  If you choose this option then
			the next two options, On breaks and On Page breaks 
			will be "no".
			
	On breaks	If the value of this field is "yes" then the break 
			column will be printed only when the value changes; 
			duplicate values will be suppressed.  A header for
			the break column will be created if one does not
			already exist.

	On Page breaks  If the value of this field is "yes" then the break
			column will be printed whenever there is a new page.
			A page header will be created if one does not already
			exist.

	New Page	If the value of this field is "yes" then a pagefeed
			will be a generated whenever the break value changes.
			A footer for the break column will be created if one
			does not already exist.
