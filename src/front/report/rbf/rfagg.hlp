To create an aggregate you must choose the aggregate function you
wish to use and whether or not it is to be cumulative.  Unique
aggregates are available for sort (break) columns only because a
unique aggregate is calculated only when a break occurs rather than
for each row in the detail, which is the case for non-unique aggregates.
If the aggregate is cumulative then the value refers to all data rows 
processed since the start of the report.  

The menu commands are as follows:

	MENU COMMANDS   SYNOPSIS

			function that is highlighted and the column
			selected in the previous frame.

	Cancel		Return to the previous frame,
			no aggregate is created.
