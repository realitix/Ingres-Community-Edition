You may specify the sort sequence, the sort direction and the selection 
criteria for the columns in the report.  Position the cursor to the column 
of interest, either using the cursor keys or the table field scrolling 
commands.  You may then edit the data for that column.  

To edit a field, you do not need to spell out the complete word.  You only 
need to type in enough of the word to make it distinct from all the other 
choices.

The fields on the form are:

        FIELD           DESCRIPTION
        -----           -----------
        Column Name     Name of column in the base table or view.

	Sort Sequence   The sort ordinal of this column for the report.
			If set to 0 (zero), then the column will not
			be used in the sorting of data.  If non-zero, 
			this will be the order in the sort list (i.e. the 
			column with sequence 1 is sorted first, followed 
			by the column with sequence 2 ...).

	Sort Direction  The sort direction is used only for columns with a 
			non-zero sequence to specify whether the column is 
			to be sorted in ascending or descending order.

	Selection       By choosing a value other than 'none' for this 
	Criteria	option, the report writer will prompt for a value 
			or a range of values for this column whenever the
			report is executed.  Only rows in the data table 
			with matching values to your entry will be used as 
			data in the report.  Use 'value' to select data
			by a specific value, and 'range' to be able to 
			select data within a range of values.  If more 
			than one column is selected, rows must pass all 
			selections to be used in the report.

The menu commands are as follows:
