Both the Date and Time components accept a date (including time) 
format or a character format.  The character format cannot be a multi-line
format, such as 'c30.5', 'cj30.15' or 'cf30.6'.  Date formats include a
date portion and a time portion.  ('Date' and 'Time' actually contain the 
exact same data value, but are named as such to represent the values
in a default report.)  You may include both or either portion
in your format.  If you would like to display the time in the upper left 
corner and the date in the upper right, enter d'16:05:06' for Date and 
d'03-feb-1901' for Time.

The Page component accepts a numeric format or template.  Characters
such as dashes or parentheses, can be included, but must be 'escaped' by
preceding the character with a backslash '\'.
