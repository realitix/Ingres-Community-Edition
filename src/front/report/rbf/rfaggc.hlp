You may specify whether or not this aggregate is to be cumulative.  The 
default is to create a simple aggregate. A simple aggregate produces a single 
value, calculated on all the values in the aggregate column up to a break in 
the specified footer.  A cumulative aggregate calculates a running total for 
each value in the aggregate column since the start of the report up to the 
break in the specified footer.
