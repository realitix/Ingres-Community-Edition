You have elected to create a new report or produce the default report
for a specified table or view.  On this menu, you should select the basic
style of the report.  Not all styles area always available.  The 'Indented'
and 'Label' styles are only available for report creation.  And the
'Master/Detail' style is only available for creation of a report based
on a JoinDef which is a master/detail JoinDef.  All the styles displayed
on your selection form are available.

The styles are:

        Tabular         Produces a report which lists the name of each
                        column in the table with column headings, and the
                        data for each column in columnar format.  This
                        will produce a report as wide as necessary to 
                        fit all columns in the table.

        Wrap            Produces a columnar report, but wraps the column
                        headings and data at the screen width.

        Block           Produces a report that lists the report as pairs
                        of column names and data, in non-column format.
                        Useful for reports on tables which contain many
                        columns, and cannot be displayed well in a 
                        columnar list.

	Indented        Produces a report with hierarchical control breaks.

	Labels		Produces a report similar to a mailing list.
			Multiple blocks of data run across the page.

	Master/Detail   Produces a report with Master data presented
	                in a break header and Detail data is presented
			in columnar format.
