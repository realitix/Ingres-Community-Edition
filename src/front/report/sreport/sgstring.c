/*
**   S_G_STRING - pull out a string from the internal line.  The string
**	will be all characters between the quotes.
**	If an end of line is encountered, it is ignored.
**	Note that the opening and closing quotes are included in the string.
**	Also, any backslashed characters are passed directly into the string,
**	with their corresponding backslash doubled except when this routine is 
**	called by report when the -i flag is specified.  If it is called
**	by report then we don't double the backslash (we only double
**	the backslash when the string is to be stored in the database).
**
**	Both single- and double-quote delimited strings are now supported.
**	In a single-quoted string, single quotes are escaped by being 
**	doubled, and are passed through transparently.  Any double quotes
**	encountered in the string are escaped so they pass through silently.
**
**	If the 6.5 expanded namespace (delimited identifiers) is enabled
**	(St_xns_given == TRUE), then double quoted strings are considered to
**	be delimited identifiers.  Note that no validation exists when extracted
**	by this routine!  Backslashes are not valid in this instance, and so are
**	simply doubled - destined to cause errors further down the line.  Embedded
**	double quotes are escaped by doubling, and so are passed through.
**
**	Note that while strings may span lines, they may not exceed
**		(MAXLINE - 2 - 1)
**
**	Parameters:
**		inc			TRUE if to point to next character after last
**					character in string.
**		tok_type	Type of string - TK_QUOTE or TK_SQUOTE
**
**	Returns:
**		address of static buffer containing string.
**
**	History:
**		5/29/81 (ps) - written.
**		11/22/83 (gac)	added inc.
**		5/10/84 (gac)
**			fixed bug 1804 -- double backslashes within quotes now works.
**		08/06/86 (drh)	Added TK_SQUOTE support
**		25-mar-1987 (yamamoto)
**			Modified for double byte characters.
**		21-jul-89 (cmr)
**			fixed bug 6865 -- do NOT double backslashes if
**			called by report (when the -i flag is specified
**			report calls s_readin to load the report).
**		26-mar-90 (cmr) fix for bug 9362
**			Do not convert a tab to a single space; let FMT
**			deal with embedded tabs.  This is consistent with
**			the way tabs are handled for data columns.  This 
**			code was probably left over from the days when 
**			rcotext was a 'c' field (now it is a varchar).
**		17-sep-1992 (rdrane)
**			Add support for delimited identifiers.  Converted 
**			r_error() err_num value to hex to facilitate lookup
**			in errw.msg file.  Correct the fact that count was not being
**			decremented when extra backslashes were put into the static buffer.
**			Allow for two delimiters and a NULL terminater ALWAYS.
**			Rename type parameter to tok_type.  If the static buffer becomes
**			full, just give up.  Previously, it read through the file happily
**			throwing away characters until it hit the EOF trap.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
