/*{
** Name:	s_next_line	- gets the next line from the source report file
**
** Description:
**	This routine gets the next line from the source report file. It returns
**	the number of characters in the line and the global variable Tokchar
**	is set to point to the beginning of the line buffer.
**
** Inputs:
**	none.
**
** Outputs:
**	none.
**
**	Returns:
**		The number of characters in the line. If it is zero, this
**		implies the end of the file.
**
** Side Effects:
**	The variable Line_buf is filled with the next line.
**	Tokchar points to the beginning of Line_buf.
**	Line_num is incremented.
**
** History:
**	3-apr-87 (grant)	implemented.
**	17-feb-1989 (danielt)
**		fix for bug 4675.  If EOF, set *Tokchar = EOS (the
**		state machine breaks down if there is a comment on the
**		last line of the .rw file.
