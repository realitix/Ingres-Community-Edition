/*
**   S_G_SKIP - skip white spaces in the line.  White spaces are considered
**	to be blanks and tabs and newlines and end-of-string. 
**	Note that strings can be single- or double-quote delimited.
**	If at an end of line, read a new line.
**	Also skip over comments, even if nested.
**
**	Parameters:
**		inc	TRUE to move to the next character as its
**			first action.
**
**	Returns:
**		type - code for type of token next on the line.
**			Values are TK_NUMBER,TK_ALPHA,TK_SIGN,
**			TK_QUOTE,TK_SQUOTE, TK_OPAREN,TK_CPAREN, TK_EQUALS,
**			TK_COMMA , TK_PERIOD,
**			TK_MULTOP, TK_POWER, TK_RELOP,
**			TK_HEXLIT, or TK_OTHER.
**			At end of file, return TK_ENDFILE.
**		rtn_char
**		    - returns BG_COMMENT (begin comment) or
**			      END_COMMENT (close comment)
**		    - s_g_skip usually skips over comments, but 6.3/03 RBF saves
**		      joindef info (type of joindef, union clause, etc. -- see
**		      rbf/rjoindef.c for more info) in comments in the .QUERY 
**		      section.  s_g_skip needs to pass back info to s_q_add
**		      when it encounters a comment.  Responsiblity is up to
**		      s_q_add to keep the comments together, that is, not to
**		      change states in a comment.  The result would be part
**		      of a comment saved as a 'where' type in ii_rcommands and
**		      the rest of the comment saved as a 'remainder'.
**
**	Side Effects:
**		none.
**
**	Error Messages:
**		985.
**
**	Trace Flags:
**		12.0, 12.1, 12.10.
**
**	History:
**		5/29/81 (ps) - written.
**		11/22/83 (gac)	added inc.
**		11/30/83 (gac)	TK_NUMBER includes numbers preceeded by decimal
**				point (period).
**		1/24/86 (mgw)	Bug 7660 - check comment level (comlevel) before
**				returning TK_ENDFILE and give error if still in
**				a comment.
**		08/06/86 (drh)	Added TK_SQUOTE for single-quote delimited
**				strings.
**		24-mar-1987 (yamamoto)
**			Changed CH macros to CM.
**		09-feb-90 (sylviap)
**			Does not check for end of comment if not currently in
**			a comment.
**		7/26/90 (elein) 31757
**			In order to keep commented information in queries
**			for rbf joindef reports which have been copyrep'd out
**			ONLY: If we see a comment in the query section pass
**			back "TK_OTHER" instead of skipping the comments.  The
**			only places comments appear in RBF copyrep'd reports
**			are at the beginning before the .name (and so the
**			Cact_ren is NULL and we skip those comments) or now in
**			the query.  But Section check is still necessary for
**			sreporting >1 report in one file.
**		11-oct-90 (sylviap)
**			Added recognizing comments in a FROM clause because of
**			   joindef based on one table.  There would be no WHERE 
**			   clause in this query.
**			Added new parameter, rtn_char, to pass back to s_q_add
**			   if reaches a begin/end comment.  sreport recognizes 
**			   comments in the .QUERY only because RBF stores 
**			   joindef info there.  It's up to s_q_add, to keep 
**			   the comment together (don't change state until it
**			   reaches the end of comment).
**		05-nov-90 (sylviap)
**			Save comments in the .QUERY to database for both
**			RBF (copyrep) and RW reports.  Need to save for RW
**			reports to handle the case of archiving an RBF report
**			out (so will have width in comments) and saving back
**			to the database.  Need to preserve the report width.
**			(#33894)
**            11/21/90 (elein) 34584
**			At END COMMENT, allow ren_type of 's' (for saved rpts)
**			to be symetrical with BEGIN COMMENT
**		11/27/90 (elein) 34634
**			Don't save comments in QUEL queries 
**		17-may-1993 (rdrane)
**			Add support for hex literals.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	09-feb-2009 (gupsh01)
**	    In a UTF8 installation skip the Byte Order mark character if found.
**	27-mar-2009 (gupsh01)
**	    Previous change did not take into account that CM_ischarsetUTF8 is now
**	    renamed to CMischarset_utf8.
