/*
**   S_G_IDENT - get an identifier string from the internal line.  An
**		 identifier may be delimited or regular, but is always
**		 considered NOT to be in normalized form.  Thus, if it
**		 starts with a double quote, then it must end with a double
**		 quote
**
**		 An identifier which exceeds the size of the static ident
**		 will be silently truncated, and may result in it's being
**		 invalid.  However, in all cases Tokchar will advance to the
**		 end of the token.
**
** Input:
**	inc	TRUE if Tokchar is to be left pointing to the character after
**		the last chararacter of identifier (which may be EOS).
**	type	Address of a i4  to hold the determined type of the
**		identifier - UI_DELIM_ID, UI_REG_ID, or UI_BOGUS_ID.
**	c_ok	TRUE if a compound identifier (["]a["].["]b["]) is
**		allowable in this context.
**
** Output:
**	type	Set to the appropriate identifier type.  Note that this will
**		be misleading when the identifier string is compound.  In that
**		case, a return of UI_BOGUS_ID will not indicate which component
**		is invalid, and a valid return will always reflect the type
**		of the last component.
**
** Returns:
**	ident	Pointer to the un-normalized identifier name, which is in
**		a local static buffer.  Not valid if type == UI_BOGUS_ID. 
**
** History:
**	16-sep-1992 (rdrane)
**		Created.
**	11-nov-1992 (rdrane)
**		Correct sizing of ident_buf - it didn't allow for the
**		compound_delim character.
**	24-nov-92 (rdrane)
**		Enable the c_ok parameter, and use that as the criteria for 
**		recognizing compound constructs rather than St_xns_ok.
**		Allow for whitespace around a compound_delim character, but
**		don't allow for comments.
**	22-jan-1992 (rdrane)
**		Correct sizing of ident_buf - it wasn't allowing for the
**		second component of a compound construct (how did that
**		happen?).
**	18-feb-1993 (rdrane)
**		Disallow leading whitespace around a compound_delim character,
**		as this breaks certain instances of multiple commands per
**		source line.
**	8-apr-1993 (rdrane)
**		Replace the main logic loop with a call to IIUGgci_getcid()
**		(which was esentially created from the main logic loop).
**	1-oct-1993 (rdrane)
**		If any part of a compound identifier is delimited, then
**		consider the entire identifier to be delimited.  Otherwise,
**		validations may fail (cf. s_q_add()).  This turned up while
**		investigating RBF bug 54949.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
