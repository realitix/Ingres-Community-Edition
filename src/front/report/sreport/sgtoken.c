/*
**   S_G_TOKEN - get a token from the input line, to transfer to the
**	forming command.  A token is ended by a blank, newline, tab,
**	comma, open or close parenthesis, colon, semicolon or a comment.
**	(jupbug #9936)
**
**	If the token starts with one of the delimiters,
**	it will be put into the token to start it.
**
**
**	Parameters:
**		inc	TRUE if to point to character after last
**			character in token.
**
**	Returns:
**		pointer to name, which is an internal buffer, which must
**		be moved after this call to save the string.
**
**	Error Messages:
**		none.
**
**	Trace Flags:
**		12.0, 12.3.
**
**	History:
**		5/29/81 (ps) - written.
**		11/22/83 (gac)	added inc.
**		7/6/89 (elein) garnet
**			Added single quote as an end to a token. Somewhere
**			along the line someone added double quotes.
**		24-jul-89 (sylviap)
**			B6866 - added equal sign as a token.
**		8/31/89 (elein) Back out fix for 6866.
**		9/14/89 (elein)
**			Ok, finally: = is back in and now ! has been added.
**			sqadd was changed to be able to handle these tokens
**		08-feb-90 (sylviap)
**			B9936 - added comments '\*' as a delimiter.
**		3/19/90 (elein) b20466
**			Adding case for < and >.  These are RELOPS
**			which WILL be handled correctly in sqadd (or else!)
**		2/4/91 (elein) b35943
**			break on end comment, too.
**		7/15/91 (elein)
**			porting change ingres63p 262575 by johnr made general.
**			Do not backslash exclamation character.
**		6/3/92	(dkhor)
**			change Tokchar-- to CMprev(Tokchar).  Also include
**			<cm.h> becos' CMprev is defined there.  Fix bug 45622.
**		8/4/92	(dkhor)
**			Back out (rejected) changes made on 6/3/92 
**			(change # 266838).
**		27-aug-92 (dkhor)
**			Re-submit bug fix 45622 in accordance to suggestions
**			by rdrane.
**		17-may-1993 (rdrane)
**			Add support for hex literals.  We look for the initial
**			'x' or 'X' followed immediately by a single quote.
**			If present, copy the 'x' into the buffer and treat as
**			any other single quoted string.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
