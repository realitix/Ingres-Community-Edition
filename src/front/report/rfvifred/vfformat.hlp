        c30.15     Displays a field 30 characters long, with 15
                   characters on each line.

        cf30.15    Same as above except words will not be broken
                   in the middle.
                                
        cj30.15    Same as above except justify both left and
                   right margins (newspaper style).
 
Display formats for NUMERIC data:

  i6    Displays a numeric field in integer format in 6 character positions.
        NOTE: money or float will round to nearest integer.

  f6    Same as above.

        f6.3    Displays a floating field in 6 character positions
                with 3 decimal places (for example: '13.035'). 

  e10   Displays a numeric field in exponential format with no 
        decimal places shown (for example: '6755e+001', '-1200e-002').

        e10.2   Displays a numeric field with 2 decimal places in
                exponential format (for example: '6.76e+004', '-1.20e+001').

Display formats and templates for DATES:

  c25            Displays a date with the format 'dd-mmm-yyyy hh:mm:ss'.
                 Equivalent to d"03-feb-1901 16:05:06", except the
                 time-of-day portion is only displayed when present
                 in the date value.

  d"03-Feb-1901" Displays a date without time-of-day. Also, display
                 first character of month name as UPPER case.

                 d"03-Feb-1901 04:05:06 PM" Same as above with time-of-day
                                            displayed in 12 hour format with
                                            AM/PM.

                 d"03-Feb-1901 04:05:06"    Same as above with AM/PM
                                            truncated.

                 d"03-Feb-1901 16:05:06"    Display date with time-of-day
                                            in 24 hour format.

  d"2/3/1"       Displays a date with the format 'mm/dd/yy' without
                 leading zeros (for example: '4/23/90').

                 d"02/03/01"     Displays a date with the format 'mm/dd/yy'
                                with leading zeros (for example: '04/23/90').

  d"3/2/1"       Displays a date with the format 'dd/mm/yy' without
                 leading zeros (for example: '23/4/90').

                 d"03/02/01"     Displays a date with the format 'dd/mm/yy'
                                with leading zeros (for example: '23/04/90').

  d"Sunday"      Displays a date as a day of the week.

                 d"February"     Displays a date as a month of the year.

  d"010203"      Displays a date in ISO format 'yymmdd'.

  d"1901-02-03"  Displays a date in Sweden/Finland format 'yyyy-mm-dd'.

        NOTE: These are examples of common date templates. Others are
        described in the manual "Using Ingres Through Forms and Menus".

Display templates for NUMERIC data:

  "zzzzz"       Displays a numeric field padded with blanks if the
                number does not fill the field (for example with the
                template "zzzzz", on a form '123' results in '123  '
                and in RBF '123' results in '  123').

  "nnnnn"       Displays a numeric field padded with zeros if the
                number does not fill the field (for example with the
                template "nnnnn", on both forms and in RBF, '123'
                results in '00123').

  "zzzzz.nn"    Displays a numeric field padded with blanks if the
                number does not fill the field and with decimal places
                extended with zeros (for example, with the template
                "zzzzz.nn", on a form '0' will result in '.00     ' and
                '1.2' will result in '1.20    '; in RBF '0' will result
                in '     .00' and '1.2' will result in '    1.20').

  "$zzzzz.nn"   Displays a numeric field with the '$' placed on the
                left and blank padded to the left (for example: '$  123.00').

  "$$$$$$.nn"   Displays a numeric field with a floating '$' (for example:
                '  $123.00')

  Dashes, commas, and parenthesis, etc. can be displayed to make
  formats for phone numbers, social security numbers, large numbers, etc.
  Examples:

  "nnn\-nn\-nnnn"       Displays dashes in a numeric value (for example:
                        '557-90-3176').

  "\(nnn\)\ nnn\-nnnn"  Displays a numeric value with an embedded dash,
                        blank and parenthesis (for example:
                        '(415) 769-1400').

  "$$$$,$$$,$$n.nn"     Displays commas in a money value (for example:
                        '$3,144.00').

        NOTE: These are examples of common numeric templates. Others are
        described in the manual "Using Ingres Through Forms and Menus".

Justifying data to the left or right:

        Precede the display format with a '-' to left justify data in the
        field (for example -c5 would display 'abc' as 'abc  '). Precede
        the display format with a '+' to right justify data in the field
        (for example +c5 would display 'abc' as '  abc').
        
        Left justification is the default for all display formats on forms
        (if a display format does not have a '-/+' justification character,
        Vifred automatically precedes the format with a '-'). In RBF the
        defaults are right justification for numeric display formats and
        left justification for non-numeric display formats.
