The Field Attributes frame allows you to change the displayable and 
many of the non-displayable attributes of a field.  The displayable
attributes include boxing a field and displaying the data portion of
the field with various video attributes.  

Non-displayable attributes include the datatype of the field (and
whether it is NULLable or not), setting the field to be display only, 
query only and changing the internal name of a field.

Please note that changing the datatype of the field should not be
taken lightly.  Changing a field's datatype may also necessitate
changes to applications that use the form and possibly a table
definition in the database as well.  In addition, the entered datatype must
be compatible with the format specification for the field.  For example,
a "varchar" datatype is not compatible with a "f10.2" format specification.

To turn on attributes for the field, move the cursor to the line containing
the desired attribute, using the cursor keys.  Type in "y" (for Yes) to
enable the attribute, or "n" (for No) to disable.

Use the "Next" and "Previous" menu commands to change the attributes of
other fields on the form, without redrawing the layout frame first.


The meaning of the attribute settings are:
        
        ATTRIBUTE NAME          SYNOPSIS
        --------------          --------
        Box Field               Draw a box around the field. A box requires
                                extra spaces around the field.

        Keep Previous Value     On data input, display the last value entered 
                                in this field as the default value.

        Mandatory Field         Data entry is required for this field.
        
        Reverse Video           Display the data portion of the field in
                                reverse video.

        Blinking                Display the data portion of the field as
                                a blinking field.

        Underline               Underline the data portion of the field.

        Brightness Change       Display the data portion of the field in a
                                a different brightness. Bold or half intensity
                                depending on what your terminal supports.

        Query Only              May enter data into this field if form is
                                displayed in QUERY MODE.  Otherwise, user
                                may not enter data into this field.

        Force Upper Case        All data input to field is mapped to upper
                                case letters.

        Force Lower Case        All data input to field is mapped to lower
                                case letters.

        No Auto Tab             Do not automatically tab to the next field
                                on the form when data has been entered into
                                this field.  The user must depress the key
                                for "nextfield" to get to the next field.

        No Echo                 Do not echo the data to user in this field.
                                This is used for password fields.

        Display Only            User may not enter data into the field.
                                Data is under the control of either a
                                3GL or a 4GL program.

        Invisible               Do not display this field.

        Input Masking           Allow input masking to occur if the field
                                is NOT scrollable and the format specification
                                is compatible with input masking.  In essence,
                                this tells the Forms Runtime System to perform
                                input masking for the field, if all the
                                requirements have been met.  If not, this
                                attribute will be ignored at runtime.

                                Please refer to the documentation for a
                                complete description of the input masking
                                functionality.

        FIELD NAME              SYNOPSIS
        ----------              --------
        Internal Name           This is used to match column names in QBF,
                                or can be used by OSL, EQUEL or ESQL 
                                programmers for special actions.

        Data Type               This is the datatype for the field.  Any
                                of the datatypes supported by the database
                                may be entered here.  Valid SQL datatypes are:

                                    float,float8  - 8 byte floating point
                                    float4        - 4 byte floating point
                                    integer       - 4 byte integer
                                    smallint      - 2 byte integer
                                    integer1      - 1 byte integer
                                    decimal       - the decimal datatype 
                                                    with up to 31 digits of
                                                    precision
                                    varchar       - variable length character
                                    char          - constant length character
                                    text          - variable length character
                                    c             - constant length character
                                    date          - date datatype
                                    money         - money datatype

                                For a complete description of the available
                                datatypes, please consult your Ingres/SQL
                                reference manual.

                                Please note that when specifying any of the
                                character datatypes ("c", "text", "char" and
                                "varchar"), an explicit length must NOT be
                                entered.  The length for a character datatype
                                is obtained from the format specification of
                                the field.  This restriction ensures that the
                                two (datatype and format) lengths are always
                                the same.

        Nullable                This is a modifier to the datatype of
                                the field.  A "y" indicates that the
                                datatype is NULLable and the NULL value
                                is a valid value for the field.  A "n"
                                means the datatype is non NULLable and
                                that the NULL value is invalid for this
                                field.

        Derived                 This is used to make a field derivable.  A
                                derived field determines its value from a
                                derivation formula, a function of other
                                fields and constants.  If derived is "y" than
                                the "Derivation Formula" field is displayed.
                                If derived is "n" than the "Validation Check"
                                and "Validation Message" fields are displayed.

        Derivation Formula      The value of the field is determined by use
                                of this formula.  This attribute is only
                                accessible for derived fields.  Although this
                                field is scrollable, the contents may be fully
                                viewed and edited using the MoreEdit menuitem.

        Validation Check        This check is performed whenever users enter 
                                new or updated data into the field.  This
                                attribute is only accessible for fields that
                                are not derived.  Although this field is
                                scrollable, the contents may be fully viewed
                                and edited using the MoreEdit menuitem.

        Validation Message      This is displayed if validation check fails.
                                This attribute is only accessible for fields
                                that are not derived.  Although this field is
                                scrollable, the contents may be fully viewed
                                and edited using the MoreEdit menuitem.

        Default Value           This value will automatically be filled in
                                when users are entering new data in the field.
                                This attribute is not accessible if the field
                                is a derived field.

        Color                   Sets the color code (from 0-7) of the data
                                window.  Only available for terminals that
                                support color.

        Scrollable              This is used to make a field scrollable.
                                A scrollable field allows one to enter more
                                data than can be displayed via the display
                                format.  Current restrictions are that a
                                field can be made scrollable only if the
                                datatype for the field is a character
                                datatype and that the display format
                                must be a single line format.  This attribute
                                is not accessible if the field does not
                                meet the restrictions as stated above.
                                Entering an "n" makes the field NOT scrollable.
                                A "y" makes the field scrollable and will
                                display the "Scroll Size" attribute
                                (explained below).

        Scroll Size             This attribute indicates how big to make
                                the scrollable field.  Essentially, this
                                sets the data length for the field.  Which
                                must be greater than the display area as
                                determined by the display format.  This
                                attribute is not visible unless a "y" has
                                been entered into the "Scrollable" attribute.

The menu commands are:

        End                     Return to the previous menu. The field's
                                attributes now have the values given in the
                                form.  Note that if the attributes being
                                edited are for an existing simple field,
                                VIFRED will check that the datatype and
                                format specification for the field are
                                compatible.  This command will be canceled
                                if the datatype and format are NOT compatible.
                                This applies to the "Next" and "Previous"
                                commands as well.
