You have elected to create a new component at the current cursor position.
You can create new trim (simple text on the screen), columns (mappings to
data columns in your base table), aggregates (set functions on data columns
such as sum(), count(), avg(), etc.), headings (trim associated with a column
or aggregate) or lines (blank lines between components).

Select the menu command corresponding to the type of the component you
wish to create, and follow the submenus displayed (if any).

The menu commands are:

        MENU COMMANDS   SYNOPSIS
        -------------   --------
        Trim            Create a piece of trim at this location.  The
                        cursor will resume at the location you had
                        selected and you can enter up to 150 characters
                        of text to be displayed on the form.  Depress
                        the MENU KEY to indicate the end of the text.

        Column          Create a new mapping to a column in the table.  You 
                        may only create new report columns for columns that 
                        are not yet mapped to the report, or for columns whose 
                        mapping has been deleted previously.  You can create
                        new columns in any section of the report.  You
                        will be prompted for the name of the data column
			to map (use ListChoices to get a list of choices).

        Aggregate       Create a new aggregate using a set function on a
			data column.  Unique aggregates and cumulative 
			aggregates are allowed.  You will be prompted
			for the data column to be aggregated and then
			a popup with a list of available aggregates for
			the column will be displayed so that you can 
			select one.  Aggregates can only occur in footer
			sections.

        Heading         Create a new heading to associate with a column
			or an aggregate.  The cursor must be positioned 
			on an existing column or aggregate, or a heading 
			for a column or aggregate.  The cursor will resume 
			in the appropriate section, where you can type in 
			the new associated heading.

        Line            Create a blank line above this location.
        
        Help            Print this message.

        End             Return to the Report Layout frame without creating
                        a new component.
