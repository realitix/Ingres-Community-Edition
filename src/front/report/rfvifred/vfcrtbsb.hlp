You have elected to use an existing table to create a default form.  The
default form can then be edited to create a saved form in the database.  
This form allows you to specify the table to use, and whether to create a
form containing simple fields or a table field.

Specifying simple fields creates a default form with simple fields placed
across the form.  As many lines on the form as are needed are used to provide
a field for each column in the base table.

Specifying a table field creates a default form containing a table field
with a column in the table field for each column in the base table.  Note
that the table field may be wider than the screen.


The menu commands are:
