/*
** DSwritefrm.c
**
**	Data structure template for WRITEFRM structure
**		(line table + frame)
**
**  History:
**	static char	Sccsid[] = "@(#)DSwritefrm.c	30.1	1/21/85";
**	03/23/87 (dkh) -Added support for ADTs.
**	29-oct-93 (swm)
**		Dummied out truncating i4 casts for offset definitions
**		when linting to avoid lint truncation warnings which can
**		safely be ignored.
**      17-Oct-2002 (bonro01)
**              Modified macros that were causing compile errors on the
**              64-bit build of SGI.  Extra Cast specifier was needed in order
**              to convert a 64-bit address to a 32-bit offset.
