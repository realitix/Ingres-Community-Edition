The Field Validation frame allows you to change the validation string and
validation error message for the field.  These fields contain the same
values as do fields of the same name on the Field Attributes frame.  The
only difference is that in this frame the fields are not scrollable, and
all the text may be viewed at one time.


The field descriptions are:

        FIELD NAME              SYNOPSIS
        ----------              --------
        Validation Check        This check is performed whenever users enter 
                                new or updated data into the field.

        Validation Message      This is displayed if the validation check
                                fails.


The menu commands are:

        MENU COMMANDS           SYNOPSIS
        -------------           --------
        Help                    Access the Ingres Help facility.

        End                     Return to the main Field Attributes frame.
