** History:
**      06/12/90 (esd) - Add ps_attr member to posType structure.
**      06/12/90 (esd) - Change 'within' macro to not use spacesize.
**                       This fixes a bug in onPos (see pos.c).
**                       Other pieces of code that invoke the 'within'
**                       macro have been modified where necessary.
**                       I've also modified the VTwithin macro
**                       analogously, even though nobody seems to be
**                       using it.  VTwithin is now identical to
**                       'within'.  (It previously differed only in
**                       dispensing with a superfluous pair of
**                       parentheses).
**	06/10/92 (dkh) - Since 3270 support is no longer needed, use
**			 ps_attr struct member for cross hair/group move
**			 support.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
