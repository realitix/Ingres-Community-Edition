The Form Attribute frame allows you to change the default display style of
the current form.  "Fullscreen" and "Popup" are the major choices.  If a 
form's default display style is Fullscreen, then one can additionally
specify the screen width to display the form in.  For a default display
style of Popup, it is possible to specify other style attributes such as
the presence of a border, and the default positioning method to be applied
when the form is run.

Note that application code can override all of the default form attributes
which can be set by Vifred.

Field descriptions are:

        FIELD NAME              SYNOPSIS
        ----------              --------

        Style                   Sets the basic display style of the 
                                form. The choices are:

                                Fullscreen - which means that when the form
                                             is running it will cover the
                                             entire screen.  (All forms are 
                                             initially created as Fullscreen 
                                             and can later be converted to
                                             Popup as desired.)

                                Popup      - which means that the form does
                                             not necessarily cover the entire
                                             screen but can be popped up 
                                             on top of another form.
                                             Popup style forms must fit
                                             within the screen boundaries.

        Screen Width            Sets the terminal screen width to display
                                a Fullscreen style form in at runtime.
                                The choices are:

                                Current    - which means to display the form
                                             in the current width.

                                Narrow     - which means to display the form
                                             in the narrow width for the
                                             terminal.  This would typically
                                             be 80 columns.

                                Wide       - which means to display the form
                                             in the wide width for the
                                             terminal.  This would typically
                                             be 132 columns.
                                              
        Positioning             Sets the basic positioning method of a 
                                popup form.  The choices are:

                                Floating   - which means that the form will
                                             be displayed as near as possible
                                             to the field that was being 
                                             edited on the last active form.
                                             (This is the default initial 
                                             positioning method for Popup 
                                             style forms.)

                                Fixed      - which means that the form will
                                             be displayed at a fixed position
                                             on the screen. Note that this
                                             is screen relative positioning
                                             which is not affected by the 
                                             forms that might be displayed 
                                             below it.

        StartRow                Sets the start screen column of a 
                                "Fixed" position Popup form. Rows are 
                                numbered from the top downward starting
                                with row 1 as the top row of the form.

        StartColumn             Sets the start screen column of a 
                                "Fixed" position Popup form. Columns are
                                numbered from the left to right starting
                                with column 1 as the rightmost column.

        Size                    Display only field showing the size of
                                the form in rows and columns.

        Border                  Sets whether or not a Popup style form will 
                                be displayed with a border.
                                (When a form is converted to Popup style
                                the border is initially turned on.)

        Note that fields which are not relevant at any particular time
        will not be displayed.  For example, if the Position type is
        Floating, then the StartRow and StartColumn fields do not display
        because they would only be relevant to a Fixed position form.
