You have invoked the VisuallyAdjust menu command from the Form Attribute
frame.  VisuallyAdjust allows you to view the current form as it would 
appear on the screen when it runs, and also to change the position and 
size of the Popup style form.

The menu commands are:

        MENU COMMANDS   SYNOPSIS
        -------------   --------
        Resize          Allows the size of the Popup form to be changed. 
			During this operation any one of the 4 corners of
			the form may be moved to a new location.
			(Pressing the [TAB] key during the resizing
			operation will rotate the movable corner 
			around in a clockwise direction.)

        Move            Allows the position of the Popup style form to be 
			changed.  During this operation you may select where
			the upper-left corner of the Popup style form is
			to be located. (This menu item is only available
			when the form being edited is "Fixed" position,
			"Floating" position forms do not have any specific
			starting coordinates, but rather float to a 
			position near the last active field.)

        Help            Access the Ingres Help facility.

        End             Go back to the Form Attribute frame.
