Save Form

This form is used to save a new QBFName or to edit Name, Short or
Long Remarks for an existing QBFName.  This form has the same appearance
as the Catalog Details form, although the command menu is slightly
different.  The Name field on this form may be modified, which will
cause the current QBFName, when saved, to be saved as a new QBFName of
the given name.  

If a QBFName with the specified name, owned by either the current user 
or the DBA, already exists in the database, you will be asked to confirm 
your intention to save before proceeding.
