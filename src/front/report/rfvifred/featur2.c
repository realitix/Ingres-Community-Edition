**	1/28/85 (peterk) - {next,prev}Feat split off from feature.c
**	11/23/85 (dkh) - Fix for BUG 6017. (dkh)
**	26-jun-89 (bruceb)	Fix for jupiter bug 6771.
**		Fixed 'previous' feature; cursor now moves to prior
**		features on the same line as starting object.
**		Fixed 'next' feature; if cursor starts out not on an
**		object, goes to (by preference) an object that starts
**		to the right or below the start point.
**	19-apr-90 (bruceb)	Fix for bug 21294.
**		Removed use of lowLimit, upLimit.  Use 0, endFrame instead.
**		RBF no longer restricts cursor to current section.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4

/*
** Find the next feature from the current positon
**
**   (Note: This function is called from the VTcursor routine
**	which violates the strict VT protocol..)
**
** The definition of next feature depends whether the cursor is currently 
** on a feature or not.
**
** If on a feature then the next feature is the leftmost feature that
** is to the right of the current feature yet starts on the same line
**  as the current feature , or the leftmost feature on the lines below.
** 
** If not on a feature, then it is the first feature bumped into
** when traveling left to right top to bottom.
**
** In any case boxes are not to be landed on by these functions.
