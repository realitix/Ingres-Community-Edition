This pop-up form is asking you to enter the name of a table in the
current database.  The columns in the selected table will be used to
fill in default column descriptors in the table field, one for each
column in the database table.

Select "ListChoices" if you would like to see a list of available tables.
You can select from the list rather than typing in a table name.

Once you have entered or selected a table name, select "OK".  If you wish
to leave this screen without entering a table name, select "Cancel".

The menu commands are:
