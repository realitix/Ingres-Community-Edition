/*
**	HISTORY
**	6/19/89 (elein) garnet
**		Added declaration of setclean (SC) structure for
**		holding the setup/cleanup queries.
**	8/11/89 (elein) garnet
**		Added ITEM to tcmd structure to hold expressions
**		for evalutation for various commands.
**	02-oct-89 (sylviap)
**		Created CTRL and BUF for control sequences (Q format).
**	12/14/89 (martym) (garnet)
**		Added LABST_INFO structure.
**	30-jan-90 (cmr)	
**		Get rid of obsolete fields in the OPT struct.
**	25-jul-90 (sylviap)	
**		Added TBL and TBLPTR data structures for joindef reports
**		in RBF.
**	27-sep-90 (sylviap)	
**		Changed BLKSIZE to 1000. (#33540)
**	3/11/91 (elein)
**		PC Porting changes * 6-x_PC_80x86 *
**	05-jun-92 (rdrane)
**		Add boolean to REN structure (ren_dlm_owner) to indicate
**		whether or not owner name string is a delimited identifier.
**		Add boolean to REN structure (ren_spec_owner) to indicate
**		that the owner name string was explicitly specified as part of
**		an "owner.report" string.
**	06-jul-92 (sweeney)
**		elided a ^A character that was troubling my compiler
**		(apl_us5)
**	1-oct-92 (rdrane)
**		Rework the 05-jun-92 changes to replace REN report name and
**		owner with a pointer to an FE_RSLV_NAME structure.  Force
**		inclusion of fe.h and ui.h so that we're assured of their
**		function declarations and of their 6.5 datatypes.  Add
**		*prec to ACC, CUM, and EXP typedefs for DECIMAL support (holds
**		equivalent of DB_DATA_VALUE.db_prec).
**	10-nov-1992 (rdrane)
**		Add owner field to TBL structure for RBF support of
**		owner.tablename.
**	12/09/92 (dkh) - Added Choose Columns support for rbf.
**	23-feb-1993 (rdrane)
**		Add CTRL chain pointer to LN structure so that q0 formats are
**		now associated with specific lines (46393 and 46713).  Also add
**		memory tag to CTRL structure since no longer using global pool.
**	22-jun-1993 (rdrane)
**		Modify OPT structure definition to add support for suppression
**		of initial formfeed (this realy belongs in rbftype.h).
**	1-jul-1993 (rdrane)
**		Add rdate_fmt, rtime_fmt, and rpageno_fmt to OPT structure
**		to support user override of RBF hdr/ftr timestamp/page #
**		formatting.  If the associated bool's are TRUE, then generate
**		the appropriate .DECLARE and .PRINT statements with the
**		format value.
**	18-aug-1993 (rdrane)
**		Add level field to REN structure definition.
**      12-aug-2004 (lazro01)
**	        BUG 112819   
**	        Changed tcmd_seqno to accept values greater than 32K.
**	13-Jun-2007 (kibro01) b118486/b117033/b117376
**		Added par_set to indicate that a parameter has been set through
**		the command-line interface.
**	23-Feb-2009 (gupsh01)
**		Added UTF8_WORKBUF_SIZE for temporary UTF8 work buffer
**		lengths.
**      06-mar-2009 (huazh01)
**              Remove UTF8_WORKBUF_SIZE. The temp UTF8 work buffer is 
**              now being dynamically allocated based on the value of 
**              En_utf8_lmax. (bug 121758)

**	up the data structures, a linked list of ACC's are

**	primitive operation.  The starts of these linked lists
**	are kept in an array, Nattributes long, of LAC's.
**	For each attribute/operation combination, keep a linked
**	list, going from minor to major, of the attributes which
**	aggregate over this attribute.  This information is ferreted
**	from the RTEXT for the actions (usually the "break footer"
**	text).  The non-primitive aggregates, average and
**	cumulative, are defined in terms of the primitives.
**	When processing breaks, the structure here is ignored,
