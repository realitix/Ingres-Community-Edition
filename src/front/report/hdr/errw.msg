**		B3376 Added error message E_RW13E9 for rbf default reports.
**      12-dec-88 (sylviap)
**              Added error E_RW1084_.  In 6.1, adf does not support sum or avg
**                 of a date datatype.  Called from r_p_agg.
**              Changed msg 13E9 to say 'characters wide', not 'columns wide'.
**      29-jun-89 (sylviap)
**		Added -o (output) and -n (number of copies) to all the REPORT
**		   command line flags errors.
**		Created E_RW13EC and E_RW13ED for direct printing.
**      26-jul-89 (sylviap)
**		Added E_RW13F0 - for bug 7011.
**      14-aug-89 (sylviap)
**		Added E_RW13F1 for scrollable output help file title.
**	08/16/89 (elein) garnet
**		* Changed wording on 13CB to be more general.  This message
**		can now occur on commands other than printing.
**		* E_RW13F2/4/5 message added for general error of 
**		invalid parameters to commands.
**		* Changed wording on E_RW13F0 to mention that values
**		may be passed on the command line
**		* Added E_RW13F3 for missing argument to right/left
**		margin commands.
**		* Added E_RW13F6 for ending a runtime session due to
**		errors.
**		* Changed title of E_RW13EF because it was too long.
**      28-aug-89 (sylviap)
**		Added E_RW13F7 - for bug 7584 (DG bug).
**      11-sep-89 (sylviap)
**		Added -6 flag to all the syntax error messages.
**      06-oct-89 (sylviap)
**		Fixed E_RW0036_r_nxt_set__Bad_break_ to use %c rather than %s.
**		Was getting 'Internal error' msg.  Added E_RW13F9_Bad_Break
**		to be called rather than E_RW0036.
**      13-oct-89 (sylviap)
**              Added E_RW13FA because RW is no longer supporting the -c flag.
**		Took out the -c in RW's syntax error msgs.
**    10/27/89 (elein)
**            Added E_RW13FB_Bad_Sort_Direction
**	11/1/89 (elein) (jb4642)

**		Added -d flag to syntax error message
**      01-dec-89 (sylviap)
**              Added E_RW13FC - 13FE for batch reporting.

**      	Added F_RW0007_Report_on_JoinDef_   "Report on JoinDef: ".
**	12/21/89 (elein)

**		E_RW0021, E_RW0024, E_RW0033, E_RW0034, E_RW0035, E_RW0040
**		E_RW0043, E_RW004C
**      02-jan-90 (sylviap)

**	30-jan-90 (sylviap)
**		Added -6 to RW's syntax error message. (US #423)

**	8/12/91 (steveh) 38434
**		Clarified error message E_RW13ED_Error_printing.
**	12-jun-92 (rdrane)

**		Remove DELOBJ messages.  Add "attribute is unsupported
**		datatype" message (E_RW1414_).
**	4-nov-1992 (rdrane)
**		Back-out the command line message change to include
**		-ansi92 flag.  There's really no practical reason to
**		have it be command-line enabled.
**	9-dec-1992 (rdrane)
**		Add "Decimal overflow in expr ..." message (E_RW1415_).
**	21-dec-1992 (rdrane)
**		Add r_m_dsort() failure message (E_RW_1416_).
**	2-feb-1993 (rdrane)
**		Correct E_RW1414_.  Used w/ FEmsg(), so needs to have
**		parameters specified in printf() format.
**	17-mar-1993 (rdrane)
**		Clarified msg E_RW112D_ and made it specific to .BLOCK
**		mode.  Added msg E_RW112E_ for the non-.BLOCK mode.
**		These changes address bug 49749.
**	1-jun-1993 (rdrane)
**		Add msg E_RW10A7_No_DelimID.
**	22-jun-1993 (rdrane)
**		Fix-up REPORT command line messages to include new
**		-nofirstff/-firstff flags.
**	7-jul-1993
**		Modify "attribute is unsupported datatype" message (E_RW1414_)
**		to function with IIUGerr() rather than FEmsg().  Remove "or
**		have been pre-deleted" from E_RW1416_, since RBF ChooseColumns
**		prohibits continuing if all column are pre-deleted, and ignores
**		unsupported datatypes.
**	12-jul-1993
**		Modify "attribute is unsupported datatype" messages (E_RW1414_
**		and E_RW1416_) wording so as not to be quite so brusque.
**	21-jul-1993
**		Modify "attribute is unsupported datatype" messages (E_RW1414_
**		and E_RW1416_) so that the line breaks are such that no
**		"extra" wrapping occurs.
**	17-dec-1996 (angusm)
**		Add new message E_RW1417 for use of II_APP_DECIMAL with RW
**		(bug 75576).
**      28-apr-2004 (srisu02)
**             Changes for addition of new flag "numeric_overflow=ignore|fail|warn"
**	25-Jul-2007 (drivi01)
**	       Updated error E_RW1323_ error to provide clearer message 
**	       on Vista.
