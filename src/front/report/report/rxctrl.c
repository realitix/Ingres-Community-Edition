** Name: IIRWmct_make_ctrl
**
** Description:
**	Returns a pointer to a string that contains both the printable 
**	characters and the control sequences.  First it determines how much
**	memory it needs by finding the total length of the string and all
**	the control sequences.  Then it steps through each character in the 
**	printable string, inserting a control sequence based on the cr_number.

** History:
**	27-sep-1989 (sylviap)

**	3/23/90 (elein) performance
**		Remove len parameter.  Do STlength here instead of
**		in calling function to get length.  This is the less
**		traveled path.
**	23-feb-1993 (rdrane)
**		Re-parameterize to accept full LN structure.  We
**		now track q0 sequences on a per-line basis (46393 and

**		Re-parameterize call to IIRWmct_make_ctrl() include explicit
**		parameter in which to return the computed total length of the
**		resultant line.  This is to ensure that a control sequence
**		containing an embedded ASCII NUL does not prematurely end the
**		line (clients were using STlength() to compute the resultant
**		line's length).  For this same reason, replace instances of
**		STlcopy() with MEcopy().
