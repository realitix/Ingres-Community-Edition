/*
**   R_SET_DFLT - called immediately before the first output action
**	to the report.	This sets up all of the standard defaults
**	for the report from the information set up to this point,
**	such as margins, etc.
**
**	This also sets up the default positions and formats from a scan of
**	the TCMD lists going outward in the nesting, from the
**	detail, to the breaks, to the report break, and finally the page
**	break.
**
**	If the position or format cannot be determined, a default
**	value is set here.
**
**	Parameters:
**		none.  Note:  if St_no_write is FALSE on entry,
**			this routine simply returns.
**
**	Returns:
**		none.
**
**	Called by:
**		r_x_tcmd, r_x_tab, r_x_newline, r_x_print.
**
**	Side Effects:
**		Many.  Sets margins, defaults for columns,
**		and En_lc_bottom.
**		Sets St_no_write to FALSE;
**		Temporarily changes the value of Cact_tcmd.
**
**	Trace Flags:
**		140, 143.
**
**	Error Messages:
**		none.
**
**	History:
**		7/22/81 (ps)	written.
**		1/11/84 (gac)	bug 1994 fixed -- .FF now does not generate ff
**				on terminal.
**		6/6/84	(gac)	bug 582 fixed -- page breaks include<d> in
**				determining defaults.
**		6/12/84 (gac)	bug 2057 fixed -- ff now at beginning of line.
**		1/21/85 (gac)	bug 4935 fixed -- terminals without
**				initialization strings (e.g. vti920)
**				now don't get an access violation.
**		23-feb-90 (sylviap)
**			Don't send out initialization string.  Dont need to
**			set the terminal width because we're doing scrollable
**			output now. (US #607)
**		3/21/90 (elein) performance
**			Removed "if !St_no_write return" check--now done
**			one level up!
**              4/5/90 (elein) performance
**                     Since fetching attribute call needs no range
**                     check use &Ptr_att_top[] directly instead of
**                     calling r_gt_att. We don't expect brk_attribute
**                     to be A_REPORT, A_GROUP, or A_PAGE
**		4/19/90 (elein) us 707
**			Correct logic to put out ff at beginning of report.
**		2-feb-1992 (rdrane)
**			Bypass columns which are unsupported datatypes as well
**			as pre-deleted.
**		19-may-1993 (rdrane)
**			Re-parameterize calls to r_wrt() to include explicit
**			length of line to be written, and ensure that we
**			compute that length here.  This is to ensure that
**			a control sequence containing an embedded ASCII NUL
**			does not prematurely end the line.
**		21-may-1993 (rdrane)
**			Add support for suppression of the initial formfeed.
**              29-sep-2003 (horda03) Bug 111011/INGCBT 494
**                      Ensure that all characters are flushed from the SI
**                      buffer before starting to display the REPORT.
**               1-Apr-2009 (hanal04) Bug 121840
**                      Establish En_lc_top (number of lines in header) so
**                      that we can call r_x_pl() to check St_p_length is
**                      at least as big as the hdr + ftr + 1 data row.
**	24-Feb-2010 (frima01) Bug 122490
**	    Update return types and add header files as neccessary
**	    to eliminate gcc 4.3 warnings.
