/*
**   R_LNK_AGG - called after all the RTEXT has been processed to run
**	through the ACC structures in the ATT structures
**	to set up the TCMD structures
**	This makes for very efficient processing
**	of aggregates.  TCMD structures indicating that an operation
**	is to be done are added in the text for detail or for a 
**	break, if the aggregated attribute is a break.  TCMD structures
**	indicating that the accumulator is to be cleared out are added
**	to the header text for the break attribute (or page).
**
**	Parameters:
**		none.
**
**	Returns:
**		none.
**
**	Called by:
**		r_rep_load.
**
**	Side Effects:
**		Adds TCMD structures to the header text of some of the
**		breaks (which are aggregating other attributes).
**
**	Error Messages:
**		none.
**
**	Trace Flags:
**		130, 132, 141.
**
**	History:
**		5/15/81 (ps) - written.
**              4/5/90 (elein) performance
**                              Since fetching attribute call needs no range
**                              check use &Ptr_att_top[] directly instead of
**                              calling r_gt_att. We don't expect brk_attribute
**                              to be A_REPORT, A_GROUP, or A_PAGE
**	24-Feb-2010 (frima01) Bug 122490
**	    Update return types and add header files as neccessary
**	    to eliminate gcc 4.3 warnings.
