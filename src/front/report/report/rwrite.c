/*{
** Name:	r_wrt() -	Report Writer Output Text Buffer.
**
** Description:
**   R_WRITE -	write out the text string to the referenced file
**		without an end of line.
**
**		This routine SHOULD NOT be called if the line is EMPTY!
**
** Parameters:
**	fp -	file pointer of file to write to.
**	line -	Pointer to a character buffer to write.  This buffer is not
**		required nor expected to be a "C" string, i.e., any EOS is
**		considered to be data.  This pointer should never be NULL.
**	len -	number of valid characters in the character buffer to be
**		written.  This should always be greater than zero.
**
** Returns:
**	-1 if bad write, in some way or other.
**
** Error Messages:
**	none.
**
** Trace Flags:
**	2.0, 2.13.
**
** History:
**	7/20/81 (ps) - written.
**	4/11/83 (mmm)- now use file pointers instead of file descriptors
**	4/86 (jhw) -- Conditional compilation for International Translation.
**      07/03/86 (a.dea) -- In CMS-only code: move declaration of 'dmy'
**		to outer scope, since someone added another usage of it.
**		Also removed meaningless "break" (not in loop).
**	08/25/87 (scl) Change CMS to IBM- use ASA carriage control for both
**	08-aug-89 (sylviap)
**		Added check of SIwrite return status.
**	1/3/90 (elein) Changed IBM to IBM370, porting change
**	8/27/90 (elein) VM Porting changes 
**      	08/25/87 (scl) Change CMS to IBM; use ASA carriage control for
**			       both
**      	05/02/90 (wolf) Test single byte char for '\n' too; sequence of
**              		inputs could be '\f', NULL, and '\n' (bug 21159)
**	15-Apr-93 (fredb)
**		Add code to handle NULL or empty line passed in.  Without
**		this new code, a NULL line pointer gets passed to STlength
**		and we codetrap when Stlength tries to dereference it.
**	19-may-1993 (rdrane)
**		Reparameterize to accept length of line as a parameter.
**		STlength() fails when q0 sequences are present which contain
**		embedded ASCII NUL's.  This obviates the need to determine the
**		length in this module, and so obsoletes fredb's 15-apr-1993
**		change.  Note that lines containing only single-byte q0
**		sequences could be misinterpreted as ANSI carriage control on
**		IBM370.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
