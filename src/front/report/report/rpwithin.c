/*
**   R_P_WITHIN - process a .WITHIN command, which may set up some
**	number of TCMD structures.  The .WITHIN command is used to
**	set up a column environment for a set of printing commands.
**
**	The format of the command is:
**		[.BEGIN] .WIthin colname {,colname} | ALL
**			...some formatting commands ...
**		.END [WITHIN]
**
**	The block of commands is executed once for each column 
**	specified.  Within the block of commands, the implicit
**	left and right margins are those for the column, rather
**	than the report, so all .CENTER, .RIGHT, .LEFT commands
**	refer to the column by default rather than the report.
**
**	When the .WITHIN command is in effect, it automatically
**	sets the report writer in block mode, as if a .BLOCK
**	command had been entered.  Therefore, .NEWLINES within
**	the .WITHIN commands do not actually write out to the
**	report file, but rather to the internal buffer.  
**	When the .END within command is found, an automatic
**	.TOP command is executed, so the next printing is on
**	the same line in the report as it was on when the .WITHIN
**	was initially encountered.  To get it to print, a .NL
**	is required.
**
**	The keyword "all" may be specified for the column name,
**	in which case, all columns are used.
**
**	Note that a series of separate .WITHIN commands, as long
**	as no other commands are in between them, act the same as
**	the .WITHIN a,b,c type of command.
**
**	Since the .WITHIN is a block set of commands, it uses the
**	STK structures when executing.
**
**	Parameters:
**		none.
**
**	Returns:
**		none.
**
**	Called by:
**		r_act_set.
**
**	Side Effects:
**		May update the Cact_tcmd pointer.
**		May update St_cwithin and St_ccoms.
**		May temporarily change the Cact_rtext ptr.
**
**	Error Messages:
**		162, 163, 164, 165.
**
**	Trace Flags:
**		100, 101.
**
**	History:
**		1/6/82 (ps)	written.
**		12/5/83 (gac)	allow unlimited-length parameters.
**		8/11/89 (elein) garnet
**			Added evaluation of $vars as column names
**      3/20/90 (elein) performance
**          Change STcompare to STequal
**		08-oct-92 (rdrane)
**			Converted r_error() err_num value to hex to facilitate
**			lookup in errw.msg file.  Allow for delimited
**			identifiers and normalize them before lookup.  Skip to next token
**			after failed parameter lookup so we don't attempt to process with
**			a potentially garbage pointer!  Handle "ALL" specially, since it's
**			a 6.5 reserved word, and so will fail unless it's specified as a
**			delimited identifier.  Note that now ALL as a regular identifier
**			represents the keyword, while "ALL" as a delimited identifier does
**			not represent the keyword!
**			Removed additional memory allocation for returned parameter values
**			since this is already accomplished as part of r_par_get().
**		11-nov-1992 (rdrane)
**			Fix-up parameterization of r_g_ident().
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	24-Feb-2010 (frima01) Bug 122490
**	    Update return types and add header files as neccessary
**	    to eliminate gcc 4.3 warnings.
