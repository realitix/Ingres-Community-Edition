**   R_X_PL - change the page length for the report.
**	A page length of zero means to suppress any pagination.
**
**	Parameters:
**		nlines - number of lines per page to use for report.
**
**	Returns:
**		none.
**
**	Side Effects:
**		Update St_p_length.
**
**	Called by:
**		r_x_tcmd.
**
**	Error messages:
**		203.
**
**	Trace Flags:
**		5.0, 5.5.
**
**	History:
**		4/15/81 (ps)	written.
**		1/5/81 (ps)	modified to allow PL of 0.

**       1-Apr-2009 (hanal04) Bug 121840
**          When St_pl_set is true we should not change the value of
**          St_p_length. However, the user value may not be enough for
**          the hdr + ftr + 1 (or more) rows. As En_lc_top and En_lc_bottom
**          are not established until r_set_dflt() has been called this
**          routine has been modified to check and update St_p_length
**          if called with the current value of St_p_length and it is found to
**          be too small.
**	24-Feb-2010 (frima01) Bug 122490
**	    Update return types and add header files as neccessary
**	    to eliminate gcc 4.3 warnings.
