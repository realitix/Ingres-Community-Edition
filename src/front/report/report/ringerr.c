**   R_ING_ERR - routine is called by the IIerror routine in EQUEL
**	if any INGRES errors occur while using the report formatter.
**	This simply makes note of the error in a global variable
**	and allows EQUEL error processing to continue.
**
**	Parameters:
**		err_num - the INGRES error number.
**	
**	Returns:
**		err_num, unchanged.  This allows the EQUEL
**		error processing to continue, and a message will be
**		printed.
**
**	Side Effects:
**		Set global variable Err_ingres to the error number.
**
**	Called by:
**		IIerror. (in EQUEL)
**
**	Trace Flags:
**		2.0.
**
**	History:
**		3/5/81 (ps) - written.
**		11/3/89 (elein) 
**			Ignore errors if silent and continue on setup error
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
