/*
**   R_GES_NEXT - get space for evaluating an expression.
**		This space is used over and over again for each expression.
**		The space initially is a 2K block, but if additional space is
**		needed, additional 2K blocks are allocated and linked through
**		a pointer in the previous block.
**
**		r_ges_set initializes the very first block and is done once
**			by the report writer.
**
**		r_ges_reset resets the pointers and must be done before
**			evaluating an expression.
**
**		r_ges_next actually gets space for a given size request.
**			The last byte is set to zero for strings.
**
**	Parameters:
**		size	size of space to get must be no greater than 2044.
**			For strings this must be one more than the length
**			of the string for the zero byte.
**
**	Returns:
**		pointer to space allocated.
**
**	Side effects:
**		Increments Next_space by size to point to available space
**		after that allocated. If the size requested exceeds that
**		of the available space left, another block of space is
**		allocated and linked to the current block through its
**		next-pointer.
**
**	Error messages:
**		SYSERR: size too large.
**
**	Trace Flags:
**		none.
**
**	History:
**		2/14/84 (gac)	written.

**
**		Fixed Alignment problem. Formerly it only allocated enough
**		space for a word. Now it allocates based upon ALIGN_RESTRICT.
**		This change was already implemented in the ingre63p line.
**	21-mar-94 (smc) Bug #60829
**		Added #include header(s) required to define types passed
**		in prototyped external function calls.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	20-aug-2002 (abbjo03)
**	    Increase BUFSIZE to 32760 to reflect increase in DB_MAXSTRING.
**	24-Feb-2010 (frima01) Bug 122490
**	    Update return types and add header files as neccessary
**	    to eliminate gcc 4.3 warnings.
