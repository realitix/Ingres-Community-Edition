/*
**   R_M_DSORT - set up the default sort list (ascending order on the first
**		 column which is participating in the report).
**
**		 This routine sets Ptr_sort_top and En_scount to valid values
**		 if successful, and (SORT *)NULL and zero respectively if
**		 unsuccessful.
**
**	Parameters:
**		None.
**
**	Returns:
**		TRUE -	Success.
**		FALSE -	The table in question does not contain any columns
**			which are eligible to participate in the report.
**			The caller should take appropriate action to abort
**			report setup.
**
**	Called by:
**		r_rep_ld, rFget.
**
**	History:
**		3/9/82 (ps)	written.
**		6/28/84	(gac)	fixed bug 2320 -- "detail","page" or "report"
**				cannot be a break column.
**		12/20/84 (rlm)	SRT / SORT structures merged and made dynamic
**		19-dec-88 (sylviap)
**			Changed memory allocation to use FEreqmem.
**		3/20/90 (elein) performance
**			Change STcompare to STequal
**		17-dec-1992 (rdrane)
**			Redeclare the function as returning bool.
**			Bypass columns which are unsupported datatypes or have
**			been pre-deleted (RBF ChooseColumn support).  Thus, we
**			default to sorting on the first "actively participating"
**			column.  Don't set En_s_count in the degenerate case,
**			nor bother allocating the Ptr_sort_top structure.
**			Don't assume that Ptr_sort_top and En_scount are
**			initialized to anything meaningful.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)

**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	24-Feb-2010 (frima01) Bug 122490
**	    Update return types and add header files as neccessary
**	    to eliminate gcc 4.3 warnings.
