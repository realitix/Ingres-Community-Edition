/*
**   R_G_ESKIP - returns type of next token by calling r_s_skip.
**		If we are at the end of the rtext string, get the next
**		rtext action string if the next command is the same
**		as the current one.
**
**	Parameters:
**		none.
**
**	Returns:
**		type of next token.
**
**	Called by:
**		r_p_text, r_p_format, r_p_pos, r_p_width, r_p_within.
**
**	Side Effects:
**		May set Cact_rtext.  May advance current action (r_gch_act).
**
**	Trace Flags:
**		none.
**
**	History:
**		12/5/83 (gac)	written to allow unlimited-length parameters.
**		12/1/84 (rlm)	modified action retrieval for ACT reduction
**		9/5/89 (elein)
**			Added check for St_cache flag. Some commands cannot
**			do lookahead, but still come thru here because of
**			new expression handling.  St_cache flag is usually
**			true, but set to false in ractset.
**              3/20/90 (elein) performance
**                      Change STcompare to STequal
**	21-mar-94 (smc) Bug #60829
**		Added #include header(s) required to define types passed
**		in prototyped external function calls.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
