/*
**   R_WRITELN - write out the text string to the referenced file
**	followed by an end of line.
**
**	Parameters:
**		fs - file pointer of file to write to.
**		line - character string to write, ended by end-of-string.
**			If this is NULL, only an end of line is written.
**		cur_ln - Current line's line structure.  This may be NULL.
**	Returns:
**		-1 if bad write, in some way or other.
**
**	Error Messages:
**		none.
**
**	Trace Flags:
**		2.0, 2.13.
**
**	History:
**		6/1/81 (ps) - written.
**		4/11/83(mmm)- changed to use file pointers
**		02-aug-89 (sylviap)
**			If output is the terminal, then do scrollable output.
**		02-oct-89 (sylviap)
**			Added control character sequence support.
**		20-oct-89 (sylviap)
**			Changed FSaddrec call to IIUFadd_AddRec.
**		3/23/90 (elein) performance
**			Remove STlength call and len param to IIRWmct_make_ctr
**		06-dec-90 (sylviap)
**			Only copies the printable string in En_buffer.
**			#34667
**		23-feb-1993 (rdrane)
**			Re-parameterize to accept full LN structure.  We
**			now track q0 sequences on a per-line basis (46393 and
**			46713).  Remove declaration of IIRWmct_make_ctrl() -
**			moved to the hdr file.
**		19-may-1993 (rdrane)
**			Re-parameterize calls to r_wrt() to include explicit
**			length of line to be written, and ensure that we
**			compute that length here.  This is to ensure that
**			a control sequence containing an embedded ASCII NUL
**			does not prematurely end the line.
**		16-april-1997(angusm)
**		We may have many CTRL structures in our list.
**		For reports with many q0 items, this can lead
**		to range of tag ids being exhausted (bug 68456).
**		Call IIUGtagFree() to free tag ids for reuse.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
