/*
**   R_X_NEWLINE - write out the current output line, and optionally
**	output blank lines as well.
**
**	If RW is currently in .BLOCK mode (the .BLOCK command is
**	in effect), then don't write out the line buffers, but rather
**	drop down to the next line in the line buffers, and tab to
**	the start of the line.	If .BLOCK is not in effect, write out
**	the lines.
**
**	If underlining has been specified for the line and output is
**	to the terminal, then ignore the specification.  Changing to
**	multi-line underscoring will trash pagination, the prior method
**	of using backspaces resulted in the underling being erased and
**	lost (destructive backspace interpretation by the terminal),
**	and using the carriage return method of explicit file/printer
**	produces a corrupted terminal display.
**
**	If underlining has been specified for the line, output it as
**	carriage return/underscore strings on the same line.	If it
**	has been specified as any other character (usually a -), output
**	it as a separate line.
**
**	However, if underlining output is to the terminal, then ignore
**	the specification.  Changing to multi-line underscoring will
**	trash pagination, the prior method of using backspaces resulted
**	in the underling being erased and lost (destructive backspace
**	interpretation by the terminal), and using the carriage return
**	method of explicit file/printer produces a corrupted terminal display.
**
**
**	Parameters:
**		nlines - number of newlines to write.  If 1, only the
**			current output line is written.
**
**	Returns:
**		none.
**
**	Side Effects:
**		Only indirectly.
**
**	Called by:
**		r_x_tcmd, r_rep_do, r_x_newpage, r_x_eblock.
**
**	Trace Flags:
**		5.0, 5.6.
**
**	History:
**		4/8/81 (ps) - written.
**		11/19/83 (gac)	changed St_l_number to St_l_number+1.
**		6/11/84 (gac)	fixed bug 2057 -- FF char at beginning of line.
**		2/21/89 (kathryn) - Bug#3902 -- No longer print .FF here.
**			.FF will be printed by r_do_page() to ensure it is
**			not written before footer.
**		3/21/90 (elein) performance
**			Check St_no_write before calling r_set_dflt
**		8/17/90 (elein) b32202
**			If underlining is going to take up two lines
**			ensure that they are together.
**		10/13/90 (elein) b33872
**			whoops.  never do a page break in a page break.
**			bug caused by fix to 32202
**		24-feb-1993 (rdrane)
**			Re-parameterize calls to r_wrt_eol() to accept
**			LN structure.  We now track q0 sequences on a per-line
**			basis (46393 and 46713).
**			Note that the code sequence
**				if ((ln->ln_below == NULL)
**				   || ((ln->ln_below!=NULL)
**				   && (ln->ln_below->ln_started==LN_NONE)))
**			is equivalent to
**				if  ((ln->ln_below == (LN *)NULL) ||
**					 (ln->ln_below->ln_started==LN_NONE))
**			Since it occurs multiply and is executed for virtually
**			every line in the report, use the briefer, more
**			efficient latter form.
**		16-mar-1993 (rdrane)
**			Get rid of the Bs_buf and all it stands for and with.
**			The FORMS system doesn't handle backspaces like a
**			printer anyway.  For ULC = '_' (underscore), ignore
**			the specification if going to a terminal - there's no
**			way from within UF to make it work in both the display
**			case as well as the file/print case.  While this does
**			effectively classify bug 49991 as a feature, it also
**			cleans up the logic and eliminates the annoying
**			"flashing" of the underscores on the display menu line
**			when the report runs to completion.  No one's sure how
**			this ever worked ...
**		23-apr-1993 (rdrane)
**			Order text/UL strings in buffer as UL/text, not text/UL
**			(how it was prior to fix for 49991).  This was causing
**			SEP tests to recognize non-significant differences.
**		26-Aug-1993 (fredv)
**			Included <me.h>.
**		03-Nov-1994 (athda01)
**			Fix for bug 12905.  Remove STtrmwhite calls in order to
**			ensure that lines are written with required number of
**			trailing blanks to allow fixed length file records to be
**			created.
**		24-Jan-1996 (abowler)
**			Backed out above change - though strictly correct, it
**			was causing 70653 which is more serious, and more
**			often reported. 12905 has been changed to a SIR.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	02-feb-2009 (gupsh01)
**	    Reset the En_utf8_adj_cnt for multiline output.
**	24-Feb-2010 (frima01) Bug 122490
**	    Update return types and add header files as neccessary
**	    to eliminate gcc 4.3 warnings.
