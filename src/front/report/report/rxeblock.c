**   R_X_EBLOCK - end the .BLOCK command.  This may be nested, so
**	this routine will decrement the counter rather than end
**	it directly.  If the end of the block is found and there
**	are multiple lines in the line buffers (at least one
**	newline was executed in the block of commands), then
**	write it out.
**
**	Parameters:
**		none.
**
**	Returns:
**		none.
**
**	Called by:
**		r_x_end.
**
**	Side Effects:
**		Changes value of St_c_cblck.  May write out the
**		line buffers.
**
**	Error Messages:
**		none.
**
**	Trace Flags:
**		150, 154.
**
**	History:
**		1/11/82 (ps)	written.
**	24-Feb-2010 (frima01) Bug 122490
**	    Update return types and add header files as neccessary
**	    to eliminate gcc 4.3 warnings.
