**   R_CLR_ADD - add a TCMD P_ACLEAR structure to the footer text for
**	the break which is aggregating this aggregate.
**	Also add to the header for the report, to start this off.
**	This should be added to the end of the footer text for
**	the break, in case any cumulatives are used in this text.
**
**	Parameters:
**		acc - address of ACC structure to clear.  This also

**
**	Returns:

**
**	Side Effects:
**		Will update the TCMD structures in a BRK structure.
