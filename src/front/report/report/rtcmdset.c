/*
**   R_TCMD_SET - load the ACT lines from the RCOMMANDS system relation 
**	into the TCMD structures, and link them to the BRK structures.
**	This is the overall control routine for setting up the TCMD
**	structures.
**
**	Parameters:
**		none.
**
**	Returns:
**		none.
**
**	Called by:
**		r_rep_ld.
**
**	Side Effects:
**		Sets the Cact_type code.
**		Sets the pointer Cact_rtext.
**		Sets the pointer Cact_command.
**		Sets the pointer Cact_attribute.
**		May set the Cact_stk ptr.
**
**	Trace Flags:
**		100, 140, 121, 120 (for reading).
**		Note:  Flag 121 will print out the TCMD structures
**			as they are created.  140 prints them out
**			at the end of the routine.
**
**	History:
**		3/24/81 (ps) - written.
**		6/10/81 (ps) - changed to read all tuples and process
**				changes in the value of Cact_attribute
**				or Cact_type.  This was two routines.
**		12/22/81 (ps)	modified for two table version.
**		12/5/83 (gac)	allow unlimited-length parameters.
**		12/1/84 (rlm)	ACT reduction - call r_gch_act.
**		1/8/84 (rlm)	Oact can be static arrays.
