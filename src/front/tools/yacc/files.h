 * History:
 *	10-apr-1990 (boba)
 *		Make UNIX parser files local.
 *	16-apr-1990 (kimman)
 *		Changing name of 'yaccpar' to 'iyacc.par' because
 *		yaccpar is used by 'iyacc' and there's a special
 *		mkming rule for '.par' files. 
 *	16-apr-1990 (kimman)
 *		Adding an endif as it was taken out by mistake.
**	23-nov-2004 (abbjo03)
**	    Use the same parser on VMS as on UNIX.

	 * files and tempfiles must also be changed.
