/*
** Name:	dl_app		Delete an application.
**
** Description:
**	Deletes an application and it's object files for a 6.0 database.
**	This routine is called by the dl_delobj routine, so be careful
**	if you change the parameters.
**
**	The names etc come from a retrieve of the ii_objects table,
**	so they should exist (except for any concurrency issues).
**
** Inputs:
**	oname	- name of application.
**	oowner  - owner name of application.
**	oclass  - class id of application.
**	oid	- id of application
**
** Outputs:
**	STATUS of any database errors that may have occurred.
**
** History:
**	19-nov-1987 (peter)
**		Rewritten for 6.0.
**	21-mar-1991 (bobm)
**		Integrate desktop changes.
**	27-jul-1992 (thomasm)
**		Fix parameter list problems. abdirdestroy is declared
**		having no parameters, but was sent one here. Same with
**		abdirset: was expecting one parm, received 2. dl_app was
**		being sent too few paramters.  the final paramter was not
**		being sent or used, so it was removed.
**	6-aug-1992 (thomasm)
**		fixed typo from previous fix.  Oops.
