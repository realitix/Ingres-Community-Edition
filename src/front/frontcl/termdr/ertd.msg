/**
** Name:	ertd.msg -	Message file for class TD
**
** Description:
**	This file defines the messages for class TD, the "termdr"
**	directory in the "frontcl" facility.
**
**	Do NOT move the error numbers around in this file.  The
**	numbers have been set up to be in numerical order for
**	faster compiling.  This is worth the cost of having
**	error numbers for the same file being split up in
**	this file.  One can always search for the name of the
**	file to gather all error numbers for a particular file.
**
** History:
