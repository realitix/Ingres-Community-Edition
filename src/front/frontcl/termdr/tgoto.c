**  TGOTO.c - Create goto string for terminal
**
**  Routine to perform cursor addressing.
**  Cursormotion is a string containing printf type escapes to allow
**  cursor addressing.  We start out ready to print the destination
**  line, and switch each time we print row or column.
**  The following escapes are defined for substituting row/column:
**
**	%d	as in printf
**	%2	like %2d
**	%3	like %3d
**	%.	gives %c hacking special case characters
**	%+x	like %c but adding x first
**
**	The codes below affect the state but don't use up a value.
**
**	%>xy	if value > x add y
**	%*x	Multiply current parameter by x
**	%r	reverses row/column
**	%s	subtract one from line count (new ann arbor, 6/84 - dkh)
**	%i	increments row/column (for one origin indexing)
**	%n	exclusive-or all parameters with 0140 (Datamedia 2500)
**	%%	gives %
**	%B	BCD (2 decimal digits encoded in one byte)
**	%D	Delta Data (backwards bcd)
**	%O	Omron  (added 25 Jan 82 - jen)
**
**  all other characters are ``self-inserting''.
