**  History:
**	06/19/87 (dkh) - Code cleanup.
**	11/24/89 (dkh) - Put in support for windex goto's.
**	02/08/90 (dkh) - Changed FUNC_EXTERN to GLOBALREF for "in_func".
**	08/28/90 (dkh) - Integrated porting change ingres6202p/131215.
**	09/04/90 (dkh) - Removed KFE stuff which has been superseded by SEP.
**	11/29/90 (dkh) - Removed check for EOF since only ITin() can tell
**			 the difference between real EOF and legal
**			 character 0xFF.
