**  History:
**	19-jun-87 (bab)	Code cleanup.
**	08/14/87 (dkh) - ER changes.
**	01-oct-87 (bab)
**		Code added to handle rows on the terminal being
**		made unavailable to the forms program.
**	04/13/88 (dkh) - Fixed jup bug 584.
**	15-apr-88 (bruceb)	Further 584 changes.
**	2-mar-87 (bab)	Fix for bug 11628
**		TDscrllt() changed to set diff to
**		(datawin->_begx + datawin->_curx) instead of just _begx.
**		This allows wide fields to scroll-left in a manner comparable
**		to scroll-right.  This does, however, change the behavior
**		when scrolling within narrower fields; specifically,
**		if the cursor isn't in the first column of the field when
**		scroll-left is typed, the scroll will position the column with
**		the cursor at the left of the screen rather than with the first
**		column of the field at the edge of the screen.
**		Also changed TDscrlrt() a little so as not to first
**		subtract curscr->_begx and then to add it back in.
**	08/15/90 (dkh) - Fixed bug 21670.
**	08/28/90 (dkh) - Integrated porting change ingres6202p/131215.
**	10/02/90 (dkh) - Fixed bug 33605.
**	11/08/90 (dkh) - Fixed bug 16627.
**	08/20/93 (dkh) - Fixing NT compile problems.  Changed _leave
**			 to lvcursor for the WINDOW structure.
**	14-mar-95 (peeje01) Cross integration of 6500db_su4_us42 changes
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	28-Mar-2005 (lakvi01)
**	    Corrected function prototypes.
