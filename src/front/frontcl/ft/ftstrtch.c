**    Name: FTstrtch.c  -  Routine to stretch and squeeze a form
**                         to make room for 3270 attribute bytes.
**
**    Description:
**       This file defines the following external procedure:
**
**       IIFTsffaStretchFormForAttrs   stretch and squeeze a form to
**                                     make room for 3270 attr bytes
**
**       This file defines the following internal procedure:
**
**       reposition_features   Reposition the features of a form
**       process_features      Process the features of a form
**       clear_area            Clear an area of a form
**       draw_chfeat           Draw a character feature
**       draw_vline            Draw a vertical line
**
**    History:
**       05/16/90 (esd) Created
**       06/01/90 (esd) Fix bug: vifred was displaying character string
**                      formats based on old width of scrollable field.
**       06/17/90 (esd) Fix bug: fields with null titles were being
**                      padded too much if fhtitx < fhdatax.
**       08/29/90 (esd) Fix bug: width of box wasn't being updated
**                      when the number of digits in width increased.
**       09/03/90 (esd) Cleanup for porting to full-duplex world
**                      (e.g. don't use FT3270-specific routines
**                      to get memory and write diagnostic messages).
**       09/12/90 (esd) Fix bug in process_features: ftyp->ftfmtstr
**                      string was being updated even the string
**                      was shared with other data structures.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**      29-Nov-1999 (hanch04)
**          First stage of updating ME calls to use OS memory management.
**          Make sure me.h is included.  Use SIZE_TYPE for lengths.

**    Name: IIFTsffaStretchFormForAttrs - Stretch and squeeze a form to
**                                        make room for 3270 attr bytes
**    Description:
**       The features of the passed-in form are repositioned
**       as needed to make room for 3270 attribute bytes.
**       All features are left in their original vertical position,
**       and as close to their original horizontal position as possible.
**       The features that may be repositioned are field titles,
**       field data windows, trim strings, and vertical lines.
**
**       For the purposes of this routine, "lines" include
**       sides of boxes, including boxes drawn around table fields
**       and boxed regular fields, and the lines drawn
**       between columns and rows of a table field.
**
**       Endpoints of horizontal lines are considered to be a degenerate
**       sort of vertical line (a vertical line of minimum height).
**       Endpoints of a horizontal line move independently, so that
**       horizontal lines may change in length as well as position.
**
**       The form is "stretched" to make room for an attribute byte
**       whenever two visible features abut in the original form.
**       Exception: if two vertical lines abut in the original form,
**       they may continue to do so in the modified form.
**
**       The form may be "squeezed" in two ways:
**
**       Two or more spaces between features may be reduced
**       to a smaller number of spaces (but always at least one).
**
**       A horizontally scrollable field may have its data window
**       reduced in size to as few as 8 bytes.  (The number 8 was
**       chosen because it's kind of a "magic number" in the IBM world:
**       for many kinds of objects, names tend to be unique
**       on the first 8 characters).
**
**       An attempt is made to leave the form at its original size.
**       In the special case where the original form was 80 bytes wide
**       (a common width, since most full-duplex terminals will display
**       exactly 80 bytes across), the form will be made 79 bytes wide
**       if possible (since the implementation of FT for 3270s
**       will display only 79 characters across on a typical
**       80-byte-wide 3270 - one column is reserved for attributes).
**
**       Any pieces of vertical lines or endpoints of horizontal lines
**       that were visible in the original form will remain visible
**       in the modified form.  (Other features are always visible).
**
**       The physical order of features will not be changed; that is,
**       if feature A is to the left of feature B in the original form,
**       it will remain so in the modified form.  However,
**       if a vertical line is obscured by feature B in the original
**       form, it may wind up to the left or right of feature B
**       in the modified form, which will cause it to become visible.
**       For purposes of positioning vertical lines, the title and
**       data window of a field are treated as a single unit.
**       For example, in the case where the title is to the left
**       of the data window of a field, a vertical line that ran
**       thru the data window could wind up running thru the title,
**       or even wind up to the left of the title.
**
**       Horizontal lines and horizontally scrollable fields aside,
**       no features will change in size or shape.
**
**       If two vertical lines overlap or touch at their endpoints,
**       they will be moved as single unit, even if the point at which
**       they touch is not visible (i.e. covered by a field or trim).
**       As a special case: if an endpoint of a horizontal line falls
**       within a vertical line or coincides with its endpoint, the two
**       features will be moved as single unit, even if the endpoint
**       is not visible.
**
**       If the title of a regular field is not on the same line as
**       any part of the data window for the field, the title and
**       data window will be moved as single unit; that is, each will
**       retain its horizontal offset relative to the other.
**       (This restriction may be removed in a future release;
**       it was imposed to simplify the implementation: if the title
**       and data window move independently, it's harder to enforce
**       the rule that no other field or trim may abut the smallest
**       rectangle containing the title and data window).
**
**       If the title of a regular field *is* on the same line as
**       all or part of the data window for the field, the title and
**       data window will be treated as separate features:
**       it may be necessary to insert an attribute byte between them,
**       or it may be advantageous to reduce the number of spaces
**       between them.

**    Name: reposition_features - Reposition the features of a form
**                                just as far to the right as necessary
**    Description:
**       The features of a form are repositioned just as far to the
**       right of their current positions as is necessary to satisfy
**       the constraints described for IIFTsffaStretchFormForAttrs.
**
**       The form is described by a (conceptually) 2-dimensional array
**       of POS_INFO structures (one for each cell in the form).
**       The structures for the cells of a column are assumed to be
**       contiguous (in contrast to the usual convention for
**       2-dimensional arrays, which is that elements of a *row*
**       are contiguous).
**
**       The caller is responsible for initializing POS_INFO structures
**       for a dummy column to the left of the leftmost column
**       of the form (e.g. to represent cells with no visible features,
**       at offset 0 from their original position).
**       This dummy column will constrain the placement of features
**       that have no features to the left of them: no feature
**       will placed on top of or to left of the cells in this column.
**
**       At entry, the dx and vbar_dx values for the POS_INFO structures
**       specify the current position of features (relative to their
**       original positions).  They can be just about anything:
**       for example, they can specify that features overlap or
**       fall outside the form.  There are only 4 restrictions:
**
**       (1) All dx's for a given character feature must be the same.
**       (2) All vbar_dx's for a given vertical line, together with
**           the dx's for the visible part of the line, must be the same
**       (3) No dx or vbar_dx may be so large that it will overflow
**           if this routine has to increment it (that is, move
**           the corresponding feature to the right).
**       (4) For each cell in the dummy column at the left,
**           dx must equal vbar_dx.
**
**       The dx values for cells without a visible feature and
**       the vbar_dx values for cells without a vertical line
**       are ignored at entry, except for the dummy column at the left.
**
**       At exit, the dx and vbar_dx values for the POS_INFO structures
**       specify each cell's new position (relative to its original
**       position on the form).  dx values are applicable primarily
**       to cells in which a feature is visible; vbar_dx values
**       are applicable primarily to cells which contain part of
**       a vertical line (whether visible or not).  They will adhere
**       to the constraints described for IIFTsffaStretchFormForAttrs.
**
**       The dx for a blank cell (a cell without visible features)
**       will specify that it is to be repositioned as far to the left
**       as is possible without landing on top of (or beyond)
**       a visible feature or a vertical bar obscured by the optional
**       (blank) part of a character feature that's entirely to the left
**       of the blank cell.  If there's no feature to the left
**       of the blank cell, its dx specifies that it be placed on top
**       of the cell in the same row of the dummy column to the left.
**
**       The vbar_dx for a cell without a part of a vertical line
**       will specify that it is to be repositioned as far to the left
**       as is possible without landing on top of (or beyond)
**       a cell containing a part of a vertical line.
**       If there's no vertical line to the left of the cell,
**       its vbar_dx specifies that it be placed on top
**       of the cell in the same row of the dummy column to the left.
**
**    Inputs:
**       start_cp    pointer to POS_INFO struct for first cell of form
**       end_cp      pointer to POS_INFO struct for last cell of form
**       incr_b      amount by which to increment a pointer to get
**                   to the cell below, or if at the bottom of a column,
**                   to get to the top cell of the column to the right
**                   (this amount will typically be 1 or -1)
**       incr_r      amount by which to increment a pointer to get
**                   to the cell to the right
**                   (this amount will typically be frmaxy or -frmaxy)
**
**    Outputs:
**       dx and vbar_dx are updated for the specified cells.

**       doing one of 2 things:
**
**       (1) If 'draw' is TRUE (first call):
**
**       The routine sets flags in the associated POS_INFO structure
**       for each cell in each feature of the form.
**       (What constitutes a "feature" is discussed
**       in the description of IIFTsffaStretchFormForAttrs).
**
**       (2) If 'draw' is FALSE (second call):
**
**       The routine uses the POS_INFO structures
**       associated with cells in each feature of the form
**       to update information associated with the FRAME structure.
**
**    Inputs:
**       frm         ptr to FRAME structure for form to be processed
**       frm_cp      ptr to 2-dimensional array of POS_INFO structures
**                   for the cells of the form, with *columns* grouped
**                   together
**       draw        should we draw features (TRUE)

**                      Fix is to update ftfmt and ftfmtstr.
