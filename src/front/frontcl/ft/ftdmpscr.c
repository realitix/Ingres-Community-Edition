**	6-aug-87 (mgw) Bug # 12989
**		Call TDonewin() from FTwinbld(), not TDnewwin, so that we
**		can allocate enough space for a form that's larger than
**		the default. NOTE: I took this code from Dave H. from 6.0
**		code. His is more correct, but here, the TDdelwin()'s in
**		FTdumpscr() cause an AV in TDsubwin() if you go to re-edit
**		table field on the form after dumping it. So I'm leaving them
**		out here for 5.0, but this will result in a slow memory leak
**		after each printing of a form.
**	05-jan-89 (bruceb)
**		Additional parameter to FTdumpscr, FTwinbld and FTbuild
**		to indicate whether original caller was Printform.
