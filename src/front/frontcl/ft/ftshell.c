/*{
** Name:	FTshell	- Implement the shell key.
**
** Description:
**	Implement the shell key.  This means to clear the screen
**	and start up a command shell, redrawing the screen on return.
**	Shell chosen is that specified by ING_SHELL, if set, or else
**	the default command interpreter chosen by PCcmdline.
**
**	Note:  The usual problem exists that under BSD the shell is
**	in the same process group as the FE, so that hitting ^Z when
**	in that sub-shell, then fore-grounding, will put the user
**	back into cbreak mode.
**
**	Note 2:  No code is included for use with Vigraph.
**	Special case code has been included in gtedit.c and
**	ftuserinp.c (when GRAPHICS on) to handle the shell key
**	in that product, but some restrictions currently exist
**	on the use of the shell key.  Specifically, the shell
**	key is disallowed when editing text on the menu line,
**	and when specifying a region on the screen for a graphical
**	item (GTpoint).  Also, on multi-plane graphics terminals,
**	graphics plane will persist even when in shell; this
**	should probably be changed.
**
** Inputs:
**	None.
**
** Outputs:
**	None.
**
**	Returns:
**		None.
**
**	Exceptions:
**		None.
**
** Side Effects:
**	User is placed into a command shell until exit specified.
**
** History:
**	23-jul-87 (bruceb)	Written.
