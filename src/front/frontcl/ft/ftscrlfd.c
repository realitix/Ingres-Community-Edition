/**
** Name:	ftscrlfd.c -	Routines to handle scrolling fields
**
** Description:
**	This file defines:
**
**	IIFTmlsMvLeftScroll		Move cursor left in window
**	IIFTmrsMvRightScroll		Move cursor right in window
**	IIFTdcsDelCharScroll		Delete current character
**	IIFTmdsMvDelcharScroll		Move to prev character, than delete it
**	IIFTrbsRuboutScroll		Delete char next to current character
**	IIFTcsfClrScrollFld		Clear entire field
**	IIFTcesClrEndScrollFld		Clear to end of field from current char
**	IIFTsacScrollAddChar		Add character in scrolling field
**	IIFTsicScrollInsertChar		Insert character in scrolling field
**	IIFTnwsNextWordScroll		Move to next word in scrolling field
**	IIFTpwsPrevWordScroll		Move to prev word in scrolling field
**	IIFTsfrScrollFldReset		Display field from start of data
**	IIFTsfeScrollFldEnd		Display end of field
**	IIFTgssGetScrollStruct		Return pointer to a SCROLL_DATA struct
**	IIFTsfsScrollFldStart		Is user at start of the scroll buffer?
**
**	Internal routines:
**		IIFTmfsMvForwardScroll	Underlying routine for mvleft/mvright
**		IIFTmbsMvBackScroll	Underlying routine for mvleft/mvright
**		IIFTsbfShiftBuf		Shift partial contents of buffer
**		IIFTfssFixScr_start	Reset start of visible window within
**					scroll buffer
**		IIFTlswLastInScrollWin	Determine whether current position will
**					permit further movement to the right
**					within the visible window
**		IIFTsfaScrollFldAddstr	Call TDxaddstr, first setting the
**					window's cury and curx.
**		IIFTsdbScrollDebug	Print debugging info for scroll fields.
**
**	All the routines in this file refer to the SCROLL_DATA struct,
**	defined in scroll.h (at least originally) as:
**		typedef struct
**		{
**			char	*left;
**			char	*right;
**			char	*scr_start;
**			char	*cur_pos;
**		} SCROLL_DATA;
**
**	The pointers in the SCROLL_DATA struct point at an underlying buffer
**	(referred to as under_buf) which contains the entire contents of
**	the field, both visible and scrolled.  The pointers have the following
**	purposes: left and right point to the ends of under_buf.  scr_start
**	points at the character that is the first visible character in the
**	field's window, and cur_pos points to the character on which the
**	cursor is resting within the window (equivalent in intent to the
**	window's _cury, _curx.)
**
**	Note:  As an implementation aid, under_buf will extend one byte past
**	the 'right' pointer.  This is so that TDxaddstr will point to valid
**	(blanked) memory even when the end of under_buf is one byte in from
**	the end of the visible window due to double byte character display.
**
** History:
**	03-nov-87 (bruceb)	Initial implementation.
**	06-may-88 (bruceb)
**		Make arg to CMbytecnt be a pointer, not a char.
**	05/20/88 (dkh) - ER changes.
**	20-apr-89 (bruceb)
**		Added IIFTsfsScrollFldStart routine.
**	01-feb-90 (bruceb)
**		Moved TEflush's into FTbell.
**	31-may-90 (rog)
**		Included <me.h> so MEfill() is defined correctly.
**	05-jun-96 (chech02)
**		cast arguments to correct data types in 
**		IIFTsbfShiftBuf() and IIFTlswLastInScrollWin() calls.
**      23-sep-96 (mcgem01)
**              Global data moved to ftdata.c
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4

** Description:
**	Insert character prior to current character in under_buf,
**	addstr'ing from scr_start, advancing cur_pos to next character.
**	Special cases:
**	*	If old position was last in the window, reset scr_start
**		before addstr'ing.
**	*	If at end of under_buf, on an ascii character, inserting
**		a double byte character, do nothing and return.  (Beep
**		will be produced by FTinsert.)
**	*	If at end of under_buf, and old and new characters are
**		the same size, cur_pos is not advanced.
**	*	If inserting an ascii character, current position
**		is at the start of a row, and previous window position
**		has a phantom space (indicating that current character
**		is a double byte character), then the new character
**		will be placed where the phantom space was previously
**		positioned.
**
** Inputs:
**	win		Window for the field.
**	scroll		Scroll struct for currently active field.
**	reverse		Indicate direction in which characters are read.
**	insch		Character to be inserted.
**
** Outputs:
**	nospace		Indicate that attempt made to insert double byte
**			character in last byte of under_buf.
**
**	Returns:
**		OK
**		(Return type should be STATUS, but it's i4  instead
**		for consistancy with insch.)
**
**	Exceptions:
**		None
**
** Side Effects:
**	Screen image of window is updated.
**
** History:
**	03-nov-87 (bab)	Initial implementation.

**
** Inputs:
**	win		Window for the field.
**	scroll		Scroll struct for currently active field.
