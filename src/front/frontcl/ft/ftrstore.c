** Description:
**	Partially restores the forms systems so that forms calls
**	can be made, but the terminal will not be cleared.  The only
**	forms call that is guarenteed to work is a prompt.  Calls
**	to this must be followed as some point by a call to FTrestore(FT_FORMS).**	It is used by ABF and the switcher to display a prompt, but leave
**	any possible operating system errors on the screen.
**
** Side Effects:
**	Won't clear the screen.  Caller can do a prompt after.  Must
**	be followed by a call to FTrestore(FT_FORMS);
