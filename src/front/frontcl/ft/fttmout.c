/*{
** Name:	IIFTtoTimeOut	- Used to determine if program has timed out
**
** Description:
**	Used to determine if the user has allowed the program to 'time out'
**	at a request for input.  If timeout has occurred then set the event
**	value in the passed in event control block.  Also reset variable so
**	that a subsequent call on this routine would return 'no timeout'.
**	As a consequence of resetting the variable, this routine can only
**	be called once after a timeout.
**
** Inputs:
**
** Outputs:
**	evcb	Set the event member to reflect the occurrence of a timeout.
**
**	Returns:
**		TRUE	timeout has occurred.
**		FALSE	timeout has not occurred.
**
**	Exceptions:
**		None
**
** Side Effects:
**	IIFTtmout is set to FALSE;
**
** History:
**	09-nov-88 (bab)	Written.
