/**
** Name:    erft.msg -	FT Interface Message File Definitions.
**
** Description:
**	This file defines the messages for class FT.  This message
**	file is for the "ft" directory in the "frontcl" facility.
**
**	Do NOT attempt to put message ids from the same file
**	together.  Even though message ids for the same file
**	may be spread over this file, the numbers in the file
**	are consecutive and makes compiling this file faster.
**	If it is necessary to look for all the message ids
**	for a particular file, simply search for the name of
**	the file.
