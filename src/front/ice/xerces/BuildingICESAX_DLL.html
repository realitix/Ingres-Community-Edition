            Building ICESAX.DLL
</H1>
<H2>
    Introduction:
</H2>
The decision has been made to rename the xerces dynamic link library so as
to avoid possible conflicts with other SAX parsers in the field. It will also
discourage people dropping other versions of the xerces library on top of
the one supplied for ICE, we hope.

<H2>
    Building the ICE SAX DLL:
</H2>
<H3>
    Getting the Apache Xerces C SAX Parser
</H3>
Visit <A HREF="http://www.apache.org">apache</A> web site and <A HREF="http://xml.apache.org/dist/xerces-c/stable/">download</A> the
<I>source code</I> for the Xerces C++ SAX Parser. ICETranslate has been designed to
work with <B>version 1.4.0</B> of the parser.
<H3>
    Special Build Instructions for the Xerces Parser
</H3>
To build the dll on in MS VC on NT you open the project xerces-all. 
<UL>
<LI>Go to <B>Project Settings</B>
<LI>Ensure that '<B>All Configurations</B>' is selected in the drop
down on the Left Hand Pane
<LI>In the Right Hand Pane select Tab <B>Link</B>
<LI>In the edit box '<B>Output File</B>' specify target name to be '<B>icesax.dll</B>'
</UL>

<H2>
    Debugging Gotcha:
</H2>
<P>
To avoid debugging woes click the tab <B>C++</B>, select <B>Code Generation</B> from the combo box. Then ensure that the '<B>Multithreaded DLL</B>' has been
selected for '<B>All Configuration</B>' and '<B>Multithreaded debug DLL</B>' for '<B>Debug</B>'
in Project Settings.
</P>
<P>
Note that there are problems using a debug enabled ICETranslate with a
non-debug library. If you need to debug the executable, you will need to get
hold of the XERCES <A HREF="http://xml.apache.org/dist/xerces-c/stable/">source code</A> and build it for debug.
