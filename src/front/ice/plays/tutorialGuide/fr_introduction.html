<h1>
Introduction
</h1>

<p>To create a successful web
application with Advantage Ingres Web Deployment Option, you must complete
various steps.</p>

<p>This tutorial guides you through these steps using
the Shakespeare Plays web application as a <b>running example</b>. You will end
up with an application that allows you to browse through the plays of William
Shakespeare. Shakespeare wrote 37 plays, which can be categorized into the
types <b>Comedy</b>, <b>Tragedy</b> and <b>History</b>. We will see how to
retrieve the plays according to these types. Finally, we develop a simple <b>shopping
application</b> that allows users to add items to their collection, see the
total cost, and either confirm their purchases or cancel them. We achieve this
with powerful macros provided by the Web Deployment Option.</p>

<p>
We start by simply selecting a list of 
the plays from the plays table, five at a time. The plays
table is installed when you install the <b>icetutor</b>
database. We then modify the document to allow the rest
of the plays to be retrieved, five at a time. This
shows the

<h2>Pre-requsites</h2>
This tutorial assumes that you understand how to create
basic HTML files with user input forms. This information is
covered in the HTML primer appendix of the <i>Web Deployment Option user guide</i>.
