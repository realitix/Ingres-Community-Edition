<h1>
Graphical Hyperlinks
</h1>
Our first attempt at building a hyperlink list of play
types was simple and effective but we would much rather use
a graphical link to do this. In the second of this series of
examples we build a link by embedding the HTML tags directly
in the
select statement.
<br>
We set the return address as before.
<h3>File: play_typeGLink.html</h3>
<div class="boxCode"><tt>

&lt;title&gt;Graphical Hyper Link to Shakespeare's Plays by type&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Graphical Hyper Link to Shakespeare's Plays by type&lt;/h1&gt;

	      &lt;/a&gt;'

          TRANSACTION=`t_type` 
          CURSOR=`c_type` 
          ROWS=`-1`

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
</tt></div>
<p>
The first thing we notice is that the <tt>select</tt>
statement has become far more complicated than it was. We
are making use of the ability to embed static text within
the statement to embed the tags for a hyperlink. We select
the <span class="hiy">type</span> column three times in all. First, to pass in as the
value of the variable passed to the target document; second
as the name of the image file (we hard code the extension);
and finally, as the alternative text to the image as follows:
<p><tt><pre>
SQL=`select distinct
'&lt;a href="/ice-bin/oiice.dll/playgroup/plays[play_typeLinkSubSet.html]?type=', <span class="hiy">type</span>, '"&gt;
    &lt;img src="/ice-bin/oiice.dll/playgroup/plays[', <span class="hiy">type</span>, '.gif]" alt="', <span class="hiy">type</span>, '"&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;'
    from plays`
</pre></tt><p>
The first line introduces the select. The second line sets
up the hyperlink anchor tag with the variable <tt>type</tt>
and passes the contents of the type column as the value. The
third line again uses the contents of the type column in two
places, the first as the name of the image file (with the hard
coded extension) and the second as the alternate text for
the image.
<p>
Both the link and the value of the HTML variable
<tt>type</tt> are built dynamically in this document. We
note that, although in this case the image files are
constrained to have the same names as the various play
types, this is
<ul>
    <li>Not necessarily a bad thing
    <li>Easily changed by joining with an image table
</ul>
<p>
We set the value of the session variable <tt>e_return</tt>
so as to re-use the display document from before.
<p>
This document achieved the aim of dynamically creating a set of graphical hyper
links but at the expense of placing HTML code within the
select statement. We would prefer to abstract the HTML away
from the SQL and this is made possible by the HTML and
<a href="fr_imageSwitchLink.html"
target="page">SWITCH</a>
keywords.
