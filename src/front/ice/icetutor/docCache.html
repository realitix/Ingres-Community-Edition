When documents are stored in the database, extracting them on each client request 
can greatly increase response time to the browser.  
This time lag increases as the size of the document to be extracted increases.  
<P>
To improve performance, Web Deployment Option utilizes a caching system to reduce the number of extractions 
from the data source. Three different levels of cache can be set for any individual document by that document's owner.
These include:
<p>
<TABLE>
<TR><TD><b>Pre-cache</b>: </TD><TD></TD></TR>
<TR><TD></TD><TD>When the ICE Server is started up, the document is cached <br>until the server is shut down.
		</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><b>Permanent cache</b>: </TD><TD></TD></TR>
<TR><TD></TD><TD>The first time a document is requested by a client, the document <br>
becomes "permanently" cached until the server is shut down.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><b>Session cache</b>: </TD><TD></TD></TR>
<TR><TD></TD><TD>A document is only cached during a client session. 
<br>As soon as the session is terminated, the document is erased 
<br>from the cache if it has not been requested by another client.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
