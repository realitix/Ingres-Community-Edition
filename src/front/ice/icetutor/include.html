Traditional HTML programming doesn't allow a developer to <u>re-use</u> code, create <u>templates</u> or build 
<u>maintainable</u> and <u>scalable</u> web applications.
Using the "INCLUDE" macro keyword, Ingres Web Deployment Option offers the ability to create reusable components, giving the web developer
a tremendous amount of power and flexibility.<p>
The Web Deployment Option "INCLUDE" macro keyword allows any document to be embedded inside any other.
With the advanced security features of Web Deployment Option, each embedded document can have its own access authorizations defined.
As an example, a page can be created where the first part can be read by anybody while the second part can only
be seen by managers.
