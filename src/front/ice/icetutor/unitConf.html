<!-- #ICE REPEAT INCLUDE=`begin.html?title=Business Units (Locations)&previous=unitAccess&next=docDef.html` -->
The Business Unit owner must declare the unit's locations.
These locations will be used by the ICE server like a temporary location. When someone requests a document
stored in the database, Web Deployment Option will extract (if necessary) the file and put it into a unit's location. 
Different extension types (.html, .gif, etc...) can be stored in different locations.
