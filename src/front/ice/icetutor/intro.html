##          Comment lines were added to end of file to prevent future loss
##          of the last line of the file by the sed command during the build
##          process.  A common sed bug is to drop the last line of a file if
##          it does not end with a line feed character.

This tutorial aims to help you to create your WEB Site with Ingres Web Deployment Option.

help you to learn how to use the powerful macro language to greatly enhance the functionality of HTML.
<P>
Ingres Web Deployment Option can utilize two kinds of communication between the HTTP server and the ICE server.
<P>
<H4 CLASS="question">
Please choose which type of communication you would like to use?
</H4>
<H4 CLASS="choice">
<INPUT TYPE="RADIO" NAME="api" VALUE="api" <!-- #ICE IF (`:api` == `api`) THEN=`checked` -->>API - This type of Web Deployment Option communication uses the Application Programming Interface of the underlying Web Server
to provide advanced connection management and enhanced performance. This works with Microsoft, 
Netscape and Spyglass Web Servers.<P>
<INPUT TYPE="RADIO" NAME="api" VALUE="cgi" <!-- #ICE IF (`:api` == `cgi`) THEN=`checked` -->>CGI - This type of Web Deployment Option communication uses the standard Common Gateway Interface and can therefore be used with any
Web Server.
