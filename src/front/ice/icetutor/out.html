When a user is finished with a session, that user must disconnect from the ICE Server.<p>
Nevertheless, if a user does not disconnect, the session will be automatically closed when the session timeout is 
reached.
The session timeout is defined by the security administrator for each user.
<p>
In order to disconnect a session, the end-user must request a page with the "ii_action" parameter set to "disconnect".
<p>
For example, please enter the url of your external "Home" page? 
<br>/<INPUT NAME="loginPage" SIZE="50" VALUE="home.html">
