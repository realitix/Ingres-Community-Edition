In order to access a secured web application, a user must first open a connection to the ICE server. 
As soon as the connection is opened, the ICE server generates a unique key which allows the server 
to recognize the remote client. That key is sent back to the client as a cookie.
<p>
An example of the connection syntax follows. <p>
<H4 class="question">
Ingres ICE provides two types of connection strategies. Please choose one:<p>
</H4>
<p>
<H4 class="choice">
<INPUT TYPE="RADIO" NAME="basic" VALUE="yes" <!-- #ICE IF (`:basic` == `yes`) THEN=`checked` -->>
ICE supports the HTTP basic authentication protocol and uses the encrypted user name and password posted by 
your favorite browser.<p>
<INPUT TYPE="RADIO" NAME="basic" VALUE="no" <!-- #ICE IF (`:basic` != `yes`) THEN=`checked` -->>
ICE offers an unencrypted authentication protocol which allows you to request a user name and password through 
an HTML page.
</H4>
<p>
The entry point of your secured web application must be an external HTML "Home" page 
which initializes one of these protocols and requests a document.
<p>
Please select the business unit of the document which will be 
called by the "Home" page.
