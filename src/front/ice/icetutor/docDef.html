## History:
##      15-Mar-2001 (bonro01)
##          Comment lines were added to end of file to prevent future loss
##          of the last line of the file by the sed command during the build
##          process.  A common sed bug is to drop the last line of a file if
##          it does not end with a line feed character.

##          Replaced ICE with Web Deployment Option

<!-- #ICE REPEAT INCLUDE=`begin.html?title=Documents (Definition)&previous=unitConf.html&next=docCache.html` -->

An HTTP document is defined as the HTML pages and the objects that may be rendered within them.  
These resources are usually located on a file system and accessed from the HTTP server. References to HTTP 
documents are aliased with a name that will allow access to the file system without providing the file system 
structure to the requesting client.
<p>
With Ingres Web Deployment Option it is possible to have the HTTP documents stored within a database and these must be made available 
on demand by requests from the HTTP server.  This introduces two models available via Web Deployment Option:<p>
<ol>
<li>Caching of frequently requested documents<p>
<LI>Referencing a mixture of documents, some stored within a database and others located on the file system
</ol>
<p>
The collective term of HTML pages and their related objects that are managed by the ICE server are known as 
documents whether they are stored directly on the file system or anywhere else within the Ingres enterprise.
