THEN=`Cursors enable Web Deployment Option applications to process, one at a time, the result rows returned by a <u>select</u> statement.
After a cursor has opened, it can be advanced through the result rows. A typical cursor application uses SQL statements
to perform the following steps:<p>
<ol>
<LI>Declare a cursor that will select a set of rows for processing
<LI>Open the cursor, thereby selecting the data.
<LI>Fetch each row from the result table.
<LI>Do some kind of processing on that row.
<LI>Close the cursor and terminate processing.
</OL>
<p>
Using cursors with Web Deployment Option allows the user to choose a specific number of items to view at a time.
<p>
Please enter a cursor name:
<!-- #ICE VAR=``<INPUT SIZE="32" NAME="cursor" VALUE=":cursor">`` -->`
-->

<!-- #ICE REPEAT INCLUDE=`end.html` -->
