<!-- #ICE REPEAT INCLUDE=`begin.html?title=Conditions&previous=include2.html&next=if1.html` -->

<!-- #ICE DECLARE=`session.ifCond=` -->

In order to provide the capability to create highly dynamic HTML pages, Ingres Web Deployment Option provides a conditional macro keyword.
The "IF" keyword can be extremely useful when a need arises to execute a piece of code based on some condition. For

<p>
An example of the conditional syntax follows. 
<!-- #ICE REPEAT INCLUDE=`end.html` -->
