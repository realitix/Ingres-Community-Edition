THEN=`A major issue in any database design is concurrency management. An Web Deployment Option application must be carefully designed to
ensure that tables are not being locked needlessly. A good locking schema helps to prevent the data in the 
database from becoming inconsistent. Ingres Web Deployment Option allows the developer to create transactions that can include any
number of queries across multiple HTML pages. Caution: this is an extremely powerful feature of Web Deployment Option that must be used
with utmost care.
