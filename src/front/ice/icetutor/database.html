First, you must choose the database against which you want to run your query. <P>

The name of the database specified can either be a real database name, or can be a logical alias. The alias can be 
used to allow a user access to a database for which that user would not ordinarily have access. See the User Guide
for more details.<p>
There are two types of Ingres Web Deployment Option users:<p>
<TABLE width="85%">
<TR><TD><b>Web user</b>: </TD><TD></TD></TR>
<TR><TD></TD><TD>A user defined in the ICE server by the Web Deployment Option Security Administrator. This type of user can access any
secured web application for which that user has permission.
		</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><b>Database user</b>: </TD><TD></TD></TR>
<TR><TD></TD><TD>An Ingres user defined in the Ingres DBMS that can be used by Web Deployment Option to connect to the database. A database
user must be redefined in the ICE server in order for that user to be utilized.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE><p>
Each web user is associated with a default database user that makes connections to the database on its behalf. 
<P>

Please enter the name of an existing database or a logical alias:<!-- #ICE VAR=`<INPUT SIZE="32" NAME="dbname" VALUE=":dbname">` -->
