The carat is the measure of weight, not size.  It is a small unit of measure equal to 200 milligrams.  ("Carat" should not be confused with "karat" gold.)  The word carat is derived from carob, the tree whose seeds became the standard for measuring diamonds.  A 1 carat diamond is made up of 100 units called "points".  Therefore, a 50 point diamond is a ½ carat or .50 carat.
<P>

<IMG SRC="<!-- #ICE SQL=`select image from images where name = 'cut.gif'` TYPE=`UNFORMATTED`-->" ALT="Cut"><BR>

The term "cut" refers both to the shape of a diamond and the precise arrangement of its facets.  At Fortunoff, you can select the shape you like best from our vast diamond collection: Round (also called Brilliant), Pear, Marquise, Emerald, Oval, Heart and other newer cuts.
<P>
Diamonds are most often cut with 58 facets.  It is the diamond cutter who examines the "rough" and determines the best shape for the finished diamond.  The decision is based on several factors...the shape of the rough diamond, its size, any imperfections, and consideration as to how much weight will be lost in the cutting and finishing process.
<P>
When a diamond is properly cut by a skilled craftsman, light is reflected from facet to facet, and then brilliantly directed back through the top.  When stones are cut too deep or shallow, or shaped improperly, light is "leaked" and not reflected back through the table (surface).  The result is a stone with little sparkle or life...and less value.
<P>
A diamond’s quality and value is based more on its brilliance than its size.  The term "brilliance" refers to the total amount of light reflected back to the eye from both the interior and exterior surfaces of the stone. Brilliance depends upon a diamond’s transparency, facet angles, proportions, and polish.

<IMG SRC="<!-- #ICE SQL=`select image from images where name = 'color.gif'` TYPE=`UNFORMATTED`-->" ALT="Color"><BR>

Color is a major determinant of a diamond’s value.  At Fortunoff, we use the Gemological Institute of America’s color scale, which measures the amount of body color visible in the diamond when viewed through the pavilion of the stone.  Color is classified by letters, ranging from "D" (colorless) to "Z" (fairly yellow).
<P>
<B>Colorless:</B> classified D, E and F.  This is the most sought after "color" for a diamond.  There is approximately a 10% to 40% price difference between a D and E rated stone, depending on other factors.<BR>
<B>Near Colorless:</B> rated G, H, I and J.  These gems "face-up" colorless, meaning that slight traces of color in mounted gems are visible only to the trained eye.<BR>
<B>Faint Yellow:</B> rated K, L and M.  If small, these gems "face-up" near colorless when mounted.  Larger gems appear tinted.<BR>
<B>Yellow tint:</B> mounted gems rated M through Z will display a yellowish tint even to the untrained eye.
<P>
Although colorless is the most valuable grade range, "fancy" colors such as red, pink, blue, intense yellow, or violet occur naturally in diamonds and are highly prized.  One such "fancy", as they are called, is the legendary Hope Diamond, on display at the Smithsonian Institute.  It exhibits a rich blue hue.

Viewed through a jeweler’s 10-power magnifier, most diamonds reveal small natural markings...inclusions (internal) and blemishes (external).  The GIA has established a universally accepted grading system, which is based on a scale ranging from "flawless" to "imperfect".
