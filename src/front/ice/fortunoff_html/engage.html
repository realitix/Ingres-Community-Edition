In 1477, Maximillian of Austria gave Mary of Burgundy a diamond when he asked for her hand in marriage. When he slipped the solitaire on the third finger of her left hand...a tradition was born.
<P>
The sparkling stone that became the symbol of enduring love, started its life millions of years ago as carbon buried deep within the earth.  Intense heat and pressure caused crystallization of the carbon while erupting volcanoes forced the embedded rock upward, close to the earth's crust, where it could be mined as ore.
<P>
Approximately 250 tons of ore must be mined, crushed, washed, sorted and re-sorted to find one rough diamond large enough and fine enough to cut into a 1.00 carat gemstone.  All diamonds are then classified into one of over 2,000 categories, according to size, shape, and quality.  Those of gem quality go to major cutting centers where they are studied and marked for cutting.  The select diamonds are then carefully cut and polished. It is from these major cutting centers, that Fortunoff purchases its precious stock, enabling us to provide you with an unsurpassed selection of high quality diamonds at the best possible prices.
<P>
Our diamond buyers are highly trained professionals who inspect each parcel and reject about 90% of what they see.  Our sales associates are courteous, knowledgeable experts who believe in the hassle-free approach to assisting you with your questions, selections and decisions.
