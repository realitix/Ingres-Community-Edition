<li>The packing of your diamonds and other precious pieces for travel should be given care.  There are many types of carry-alls, especially designed for jewelry travel, available in all price ranges.  They come in all sizes, shapes and patterns.  Most have velvet pads inside to attach pins and earrings, and special compartments for bracelets and necklaces.</li>
