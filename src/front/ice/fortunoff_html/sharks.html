Just about every "diamond dealer" uses the technical terms created by the Gemological Institute of America (GIA).  But some unscrupulous dealers say their stones are much better than they really are. Some of them simply don’t know how to grade accurately and end up exaggerating to sound good.  Either way, you could easily end up with LESS than you bargained for.
<P>
At Fortunoff, every diamond is carefully graded according to the GIA’s strict guidelines.  Our GIA-trained team of diamond buyers creates a plotsheet for each diamond, stating its grade and unique characteristics.  You’ll receive your diamond’s plotsheet with your purchase so you’ll know exactly what you’re getting.

These days there are many ways to artificially treat diamonds to hide their visible imperfections.  Diamonds can be dyed, coated, laser drilled or even filled-in with glass.  These treatments often aren’t permanent, and many dealers won’t even tell you it’s there.  This deception means you’re paying far too much for the quality you’ve really gotten.
<P>
At Fortunoff, we absolutely will not buy or sell any diamond that has been artificially treated.  Our diamond buyers, expertly trained by the GIA, meticulously examine every diamond to make sure it has not been fracture filled, died, coated or otherwise treated.  We refuse to trade in treated stones so you’ll never have any unpleasant surprises.  When you buy from Fortunoff, the price you pay is an honest reflection of the value of your diamond.

Those ads you’ve seen for "one-carat total weight" diamonds or "half carat engagement rings" are deceptive.  The weights are rarely exact, and often are exaggerated.  Total weight doesn’t mean the weight of the single center stone but the sum of ALL the stones--so it’s hard to know what you’ve really bought.  This practice is not only deceptive, it may also be illegal.
<P>
At Fortunoff, we weigh and mark every engagement ring with the exact carat weight (to a one-hundredth of a carat).  You’ll know the exact weight of the center stone and the exact weights of the side stones.

<img src="<!-- #ICE SQL=`select image from images where name = 'false.gif'` TYPE=`UNFORMATTED`-->" alt=False Pricing><BR>
Many "SHARKS" inflate their prices beyond fair market value so that they can legitimately claim "50% OFF!"  It may be legal, but it sure is deceptive.
<P>
At Fortunoff, our prices are lower than the shark’s so-called "50% Off" Sales.  We buy direct in huge quantities and pass the savings on to you.  So you never have to wait for a sale.  We have the lowest prices every day...we guarantee it!
<P>

<img src="<!-- #ICE SQL=`select image from images where name = 'appr.gif'` TYPE=`UNFORMATTED`-->" alt=Diamond Appraisals>
<BR>
There are no federal, state or local laws regulating who can appraise jewelry.  Only qualified appraisers, not affiliated with a jewelry seller can be independent. An honest and accurate appraisal should be an independent one.  Don’t be afraid to ask.
<P>
The Fortunoff "estimate of value for replacement" is supplied with your diamond purchase, for insurance needs.  We stand behind the quality and value of our diamonds.   We are confident that our grading of the diamond you buy will meet the highest industry standards for accuracy.
