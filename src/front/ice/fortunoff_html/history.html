<P>For <FONT SIZE=6>75 </FONT>years, the <FONT SIZE=5>Best </FONT>of <FONT SIZE=5>Everything</FONT>. </P>
<FONT SIZE=4><P>1922. </FONT>Warren G. Harding was president. The country was prospering, led by a booming auto industry. The Lincoln Memorial was dedicated and King Tut's tomb was discovered. Audiences cheered for <I>The Ziegfeld Follies</I> on Broadway and wept at D.W. Griffith's <I>Orphans of the Storm</I> in movie houses. The N.Y. Giants defeated the N.Y. Yankees to win the world series. </P>
<P>And, in <FONT SIZE=4>1922</FONT>, <FONT SIZE=4>Max</FONT> and <FONT SIZE=4>Clara</FONT> Fortunoff opened the doors of their neighborhood housewares store in Brooklyn. Here was a store with a real difference…with a vast selection of quality merchandise… knowledgeable, attentive sales clerks… and remarkably low prices.</P>
<P>Those attributes, which have become the hallmarks of the company, not only turned the store into a Brooklyn landmark but soon led to eight Fortunoff shops, all located under the elevated subway on <FONT SIZE=4>Livonia </FONT>Avenue. </P>
<P>In 1964, Fortunoff followed its customers’ migration to the suburbs and set up shop in a sparkling new superstore in <FONT SIZE=4>Westbury</FONT>, Long Island. Since then, we have opened 5 more stores: Wayne Towne Center, Woodbridge Center, Paramus (2 stores), and the "jewel in our crown" on New York City’s prestigious <FONT SIZE=4>5th Avenue</FONT>. </P>
<FONT SIZE=4><P>Today</FONT>, Fortunoff provides customers with necessities and niceties: fine jewelry and watches, antique jewelry and silver, everything for the table, fine gifts, home furnishing, everything for the bedroom and bathroom, fireplace furnishings, housewares and seasonal shops--outdoor furniture in the summer and Christmas in the winter. </P>
<FONT SIZE=4><P>Selection. Service. Everyday low prices...guaranteed! </FONT>These are the principles that have propelled Fortunoff from Brooklyn to the World Wide Web. You can still choose from the world’s largest assortment of the most affordable and prestigious collections at the very best prices everyday of the year. Rest assured that as a Fortunoff customer, your satisfaction is guaranteed! </P>
