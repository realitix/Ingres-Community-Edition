<h1>Welcome to the Ingres PHP IFF Demo</h1>
<h2>Environment Requirements</h2>
To run the Ingres Demo you need the following components
<ul>
<li>Apache Webserver (2.x or higher)</li>
<li>PHP 5.x (or higher)</li>
<li>Ingres DBMS (9.1.0 or higher)</li>
<li>Ingres PHP driver 1.4.3 (available on 
	<a href="http://pecl.php.net/package/ingres">http://pecl.php.net/package/ingres</a>).<br/>
	If you need more help on installing and configuring the PHP driver please see 
	<a href="http://community.actian.com/wiki/PHP_Driver">http://community.actian.com/wiki/PHP_Driver</a>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Unpacking the tarball</h2>
To unpack the tarball just execute the command:
<pre>
	tar -xvzf ingresPhpIff.tgz
</pre>
This will create an subdirectory called IFF including all necessary files.
<h2>Configuring the IFF application</h2>
The configuration of the IFF is straight-forward. Just open the editor of your choice and point it to the file 
LocalSettings.php that resides within the just created directory.
You'll find three constants in there:
<pre>
define('DATABASE','demodb');
define('USER','ingres');
define('PASSWORD','');
</pre>
Please fill in the necessary information. This constants are used for the default connection to the Database. 
You can change the connection information within the IFF too. But that's only for the lifetime of the PHP Session.
<p>If you want the application to work after you <b>point your browser to the file "index.php" </b>in the directory where you just unpacked the application then
you must fill in the correct values.
</p>
<p>
After you changed the connection information within the application and you want to use the default credentials, just type "(local)"
in the field named "hostname" and nothing else.
