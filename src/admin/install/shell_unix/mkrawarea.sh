#  Name: mkrawarea - set up a raw device as an INGRES area
#
#  Usage:
#	mkrawarea
#
#  Description:
#	Guide user thru procedure for setting up a raw device as
#	an INGRES area.
#
#	This script must be run as 'root'.
#
#	The raw disk should just be any disk device that does not have a
#	unix file system on it (ie. /dev/rxy0d).  We will then create a 
#	hard link from the <area_path> to the disk device.
#   
#	We also check that the raw device is not created in partition "a" or "c".
#	These partitions are reserved to access a disk and raw devices should
#	not be created there.
#   
#	After everything is ok the needed subdirectories are created as
#	needed and a hard link is created to the device as
#	    <area_path>/ingres/data/default/iirawdevice
#	and the number of blocks in the device stored in
#	    <area_path>/ingres/data/default/iirawblocks
#
#	Note that any changes made to this path construction will
#	impact or break LOingpath. DM2F is sensitive to the selection of
#	filenames and the content of "iirawblocks". For those reasons
#	the equivalent defined DM2F_RAW_??? values are used in here
#	as variable names as a reminder that if either changes, so
#	must the other. 
#
#	See back/dmf/hdr/dm2f.h
#
# Exit status:
#	0	OK
#	1	must be root to run	
#	2	required symbol not defined
#	3	<area_path> does not exist
#	4	path not a character special device
#	5	device contains file system
#	6	can't determine size of device
#	7	device too small for file
#	8	/etc/mknod of file failed
#	9	cannot use partition a or c to create a raw device
#	10	the area directory contains files and cannot be used
#
## History
##	19-Mar-2001 (jenjo02)
##	    Sculpted from mkrawlog.sh
##	09-May-2001 (jenjo02)
##	    Rewrote such that user must supply <area_path> rather
##	    than using $II_SYSTEM/ingres/data/raw/<device_name>
##	    construct. This makes the raw area creation process 
##	    identical to that used for cooked areas and locations.
##	18-Sep-2001 (jenjo02)
##	    Renamed from MKRAWARE to MKRAWAREA
##	19-Feb-2010 (hanje04)
##	    SIR 123296
##	    Add support for LSB builds

In order to be used as a raw (unbuffered) Ingres area,
a raw device must be a character special file and must contain

The special character raw device you specify must not contain
a Unix file system.
