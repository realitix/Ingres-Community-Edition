**	RsltCurs	Cursor result-set.
**
** History:
**	14-May-99 (gordy)
**	    Created.
**	 8-Sep-99 (gordy)
**	    Created new base class for class which interact with
**	    the JDBC server and extracted common data and methods.
**	    Synchronize entire request/response with JDBC server.
**	13-Sep-99 (gordy)
**	    Implemented error code support.
**	29-Sep-99 (gordy)
**	    Added class to support BLOBs as streams.  Implemented
**	    BLOB data support.  Use DbConn lock()/unlock() methods
**	    for synchronization.
**	11-Nov-99 (gordy)
**	    Extracted base functionality to EdbcRslt.java.
**	13-Dec-99 (gordy)
**	    Added support for pre-fetching of rows.
**	 4-May-00 (gordy)
**	    Extracted multi-row handling to base class.
**	27-Oct-00 (gordy)
**	    Extracted server operational support to new base class
**	    while keeping control of connection locking.
**	 3-Nov-00 (gordy)
**	    Added support for JDBC 2.0 extensions.
**	23-Jan-01 (gordy)
**	    Changed parameter type to EdbcStmt for backward compatibility.

/*
** Name: RsltCurs
**
** Description:
**	EDBC JDBC Java driver class which implements the
**	JDBC ResultSet interface for DBMS result data which
**	is obtained through a cursor.
**
**	Most of the functionality for this class is inherited
**	from the super-classes, especially the direct super-
**	class RsltFtch.  The only significant extensions for
**	a cursor result-set are connection locking and a cursor
**	name.  For cursors, the connection is locked only during
**	the cursor fetch and close requests. 
**
**	Data sets containing BLOBs complicate the locking scheme
**	since the cursor fetch must be interrupted on the driver
**	side for BLOB processing.  The connection must remain
**	locked until the BLOB has been processed and the remainder
**	of the data set has been received.  The interaction of 
**	the load(), shut(), flush() and resume() methods makes it 
**	difficult to know the precise data set processing state at 
**	this level.  For this reason, this result-set maintains 
**	its own locking state so that locking requests are only 
**	performed when actually needed.
**
**  Overridden Methods:
**
**	load		    Load data subset.
**	closeCursor	    Close cursor.
**	flush		    Flush the input message stream.
**	resume		    Continue result processing after BLOB.
**	getCursorName	    Retrieve the associated cursor name.
**
**
**  Private Methods:
**
**	lock		    Lock the connection.
**	unlock		    Unlock the connection.
**
**  Local Data:
**
**	cursor		    Name of cursor associated with the result set.
**	locked		    Lock state.
**
** History:
**	14-May-99 (gordy)
**	    Created.
**	29-Sep-99 (gordy)
**	    Implemented support for BLOB data and added support
**	    methods and fields.
**	11-Nov-99 (gordy)
**	    Extracted base functionality to EdbcRslt.
**	 4-May-00 (gordy)
**	    Extracted multi-row handling to base class.
**	27-Oct-00 (gordy)
**	    Extracted server operational support to new base class
**	    while keeping control of connection locking.
