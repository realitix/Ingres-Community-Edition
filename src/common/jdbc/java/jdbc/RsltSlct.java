/*
** Name: RsltSlct
**
** Description:
**	EDBC JDBC Java driver class which implements the
**	JDBC ResultSet interface for DBMS result data which
**	is obtained through a select-loop.
**
**	Most of the functionality for this class is inherited
**	from the super-classes, especially the direct super-
**	class RsltFtch.  The only significant extension for
**	a select-loop result-set is connection locking.  For 
**	select-loops, the connection is locked from the start 
**	of the query until the result set is closed.  
**
**	Although select loops produce a continuous data stream
**	from the DBMS server, result-set data is still handled 
**	on a fetch request basis between the driver and the JDBC 
**	server.  The JDBC server hides the difference between
**	cursor fetches and select-loop tuple streams.
**
**  Overridden Methods:
**
**	closeCursor	    Close cursor.
**
** History:
**	17-May-00 (gordy)
**	    Created.
**	27-Oct-00 (gordy)
**	    New super class which doesn't enforce connection
**	    locking or cursor oriented operations.
**	28-Mar-01 (gordy)
**	    Rename shut() to closeCursor().
