	** History:
	**	14-May-99 (gordy)

	**	 8-Sep-99 (gordy)
	**	    Created new base class for class which interact with
	**	    the server and extracted common data and methods.
	**	    Synchronize entire request/response with server.
	**	13-Sep-99 (gordy)
	**	    Implemented error code support.
	**	29-Sep-99 (gordy)

	/*
	** Name: RsltCurs
	**
	** Description:
	**	driver class which implements the ResultSet interface
	**	as an extension of server row fetching by adding support for
	**	cursor processing.
	**
	**	Most of the functionality for this class is inherited from the 
	**	super-classes, especially the direct super-class RsltFtch.  The 
	**	only significant extensions involve connection locking and the
	**	cursor name.  For cursors, the connection is locked only during
	**	the cursor fetch and close requests.  The connection should be
	**	unlocked immediately after opening the cursor.
	**
	**	Data sets containing BLOBs complicate the locking scheme since 
	**	the cursor fetch must be interrupted on the driver side for BLOB 
	**	processing.  The connection must remain locked until the BLOB 
	**	has been processed and the remainder of the data set has been 
	**	received.  
	**
	**	The super-class provides three methods which may be overridden
	**	to provide connection locking: fetch(), resume(), closeCursor().  
	**	The fetch() and resume() methods are used during data loading.  
	**	The fetch() method is called only when the connection is dormant 
	**	and leaves the connection dormant unless a BLOB column is active.  
	**	The resume() methods is called when the connection is active 
	**	after an active BLOB has been flushed.  Like fetch(), resume() 
	**	leaves the connection dormant unless a BLOB column is active.  
	**	The closeCursor() method is called only when the connection is
	**	dormant and leaves the connection dormant.
	**
	**	The connection locking in the local implementations of fetch(),
	**	resume(), and closeCursor() following the guidelines listed
	**	above: locking the connection upon entry when dormant and
	**	unlocking on exit if no BLOB is active.
	**
	**  Overridden Methods:
	**
	**	getCursorName	    Retrieve the associated cursor name.
	**	fetch		    Fetch rows from DBMS.
	**	closeCursor	    Close cursor.
	**	resume		    Continue result processing after BLOB.
	**
	**  Private Data:
	**
	**	cursor		    Name of associated DBMS cursor.
	**
	** History:
	**	14-May-99 (gordy)
	**	    Created.
	**	29-Sep-99 (gordy)
	**	    Implemented support for BLOB data and added support
	**	    methods and fields.
	**	11-Nov-99 (gordy)
	**	    Extracted base functionality to AdvanRslt.
	**	 4-May-00 (gordy)
	**	    Extracted multi-row handling to base class.
	**	27-Oct-00 (gordy)
	**	    Extracted server operational support to new base class
	**	    while keeping control of connection locking.
	**	28-Mar-01 (gordy)
	**	    Renamed shut() to closeCursor().
	**	 5-Sep-02 (thoda04)
	**	    Ported for .NET Provider.
	**	 4-Aug-03 (gordy)
	**	    Simplified super-class implementation removes need for
	**	    local lock tracking: locked, lock() and unlock().  Super-
	**	    class load() renamed to fetch().  Removed flush() as it
	**	    no longer needs locking.
