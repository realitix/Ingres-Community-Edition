	** Name: RsltSlct
	**
	** Description:
	**	driver class which implements the ResultSet interface
	**	as an extension of server row fetching by adding support for
	**	select-loop processing.
	**
	**	Most of the functionality for this class is inherited from the 
	**	super-classes, especially the direct super-class RsltFtch.  The 
	**	only significant extension involves connection locking.  For 
	**	select-loops, the connection is locked from the start of the 
	**	query until the result set is closed.  The connection should
	**	not be unlocked after issuing the SELECT query.
	**
	**	Although select loops produce a continuous data stream from the 
	**	DBMS server, result-set data is still handled on a fetch request 
	**	basis between the driver and server.  The server hides the 
	**	difference between cursor fetches and select-loop tuple streams.
	**
	**  Overridden Methods:
	**
	**	closeCursor	    Close simulated cursor.
	**
	** History:
	**	17-May-00 (gordy)
	**	    Created.
	**	27-Oct-00 (gordy)
	**	    New super class which doesn't enforce connection
	**	    locking or cursor oriented operations.
	**	28-Mar-01 (gordy)
	**	    Rename shut() to closeCursor().
