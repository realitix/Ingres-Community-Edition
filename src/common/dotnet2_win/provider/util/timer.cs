	** Name: Timer
	**
	** Description:
	**	Class which provides the ability to asynchronously perform
	**	an action after a specified amount of time has expired.
	**	Uses the ICallback interface to perform the desired action.
	**
	**	The timer is implemented as a separate thread and should be
	**	started by calling the start() method inherited from the
	**	Thread class.  The timer may be cancelled by calling the
	**	interrupt() method.  If, after calling start(), the time
	**	expires, a callback is made, in the context of the timer
	**	thread, to perform whatever action is desired.  The ICallback
	**	interface is used to define the callback method: timeExpired().
	**
	** History:
	**	16-Nov-99 (gordy)
	**	    Created.
	**	18-Nov-99 (gordy)
	**	    Brought in Alarm as a nested interface.
	**	18-Apr-00 (gordy)
	**	    Renamed Alarm to Callback. (For .NET: ICallback (thoda04))*/
