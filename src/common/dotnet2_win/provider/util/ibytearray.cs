	/*
	** Name: IByteArray
	**
	** Description:
	**	Interface which provides access to an object as a byte array.
	**
	**	Byte arrays are variable length with a current length and
	**	capacity.  Byte arrays may also have an optional maximum
	**	length (size limit).  
	**
	**	Initially, byte arrays have zero length, an implementation 
	**	determined capacity and no size limit.  The length of the
	**	array can grow until it reaches the size limit (if set).  
	**	Array capacity is automatically extended to accomodate growth 
	**	requests.  A mininum capacity may be set to minimize costly 
	**	changes in the capacity of the array.
	**
	**  Inherited Methods:
	**
	**	capacity	Determine capacity of the array.
	**	ensureCapacity	Set minimum capacity of the array.
	**	limit		Set or determine maximum capacity of the array.
	**	length		Determine the current length of the array.
	**	clear		Set array length to zero.
	**
	**  Public Methods:
	**
	**	get		Copy bytes out of the array.
	**	put		Copy bytes into the array.
	**
	** History:
	**	 5-Sep-03 (gordy)
	**	    Created.
