	/*
	** Name: ICharArray
	**
	** Description:
	**	Interface which provides access to an object as a character array.
	**
	**	Character arrays are variable length with a current length and
	**	capacity.  Character arrays may also have an optional maximum
	**	length (size limit).  
	**
	**	Initially, character arrays have zero length, an implementation 
	**	determined capacity and no size limit.  The length of the array 
	**	can grow until it reaches the size limit (if set).  Array capacity
	**	is automatically extended to accomodate growth requests. A minimum
	**	capacity may be set to minimize costly changes in the capacity of 
	**	the array.
	**
	**  Inherited Methods:
	**
	**	capacity	Determine capacity of the array.
	**	ensureCapacity	Set minimum capacity of the array.
	**	limit		Set or determine maximum capacity of the array.
	**	length		Determine the current length of the array.
	**	clear		Set array length to zero.
	**
	**  Public Methods:
	**
	**	get		Copy characters out of the array.
	**	put		Copy characters into the array.
	**
	** History:
	**	 5-Sep-03 (gordy)
	**	    Created.
	**	 1-Dec-03 (gordy)
	**	    Added get() method to access specific array element.
