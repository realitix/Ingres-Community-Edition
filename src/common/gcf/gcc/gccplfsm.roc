/**
** Name: GCCPLFSM.ROC - State machine for Presentation Layer
**
** History:
**      25-Jan-88 (jbowers)
**          Initial module creation
**      18-Jan-89 (jbowers)
**          Added valid intersections to accommodate certain obscure error
**	    conditions. 
**      16-Mar-89 (jbowers)
**	    Fix for bug # 5075:
**          Fix for failure to clean up sessions when ARU PPDU is received on a
**	    session currently in the process of closing.
**	12-Jan-90 (seiwald)
**	     Ironed out ownership of MDE's: an MDE now belongs to exactly 
**	     one layer at a time.  See change comments in gccal.c.
**	25-Jan-90 (seiwald)
**	    Revised output events for MDE's which undergo network
**	    conversion:  previously, the OPDCIE, OPDCIN, OPDCOE, or
**	    OPDCON events converted a single input MDE into a chain of
**	    MDE's, each element of which was then handed to the OPPDI,
**	    OPPEI, OPSDQ, or OPSEQ output events for sending to the
**	    next layer.  Now, new output events OPPDIH, OPPEIH, OPSDQH,
**	    and OPSEQH both convert the MDE and send MDE's to the next 
**	    layer as necessary.  A new event OPMDE deletes the input
**	    MDE.  Code to load the in-transit tuple descriptors is
**	    now performed directly by the het output events, rather
**	    than by special states.
**	1-Mar-91 (seiwald)
**	    Extracted from GCCPL.H.
**	2-May-91 (cmorris)
**	    Allow user abort after connection release requested.
**	20-May-91 (cmorris)
**	    Added support for release collisions.
**	20-May-91 (seiwald)
**	    Include <qu.h> to accomodate new structure definitions in
**	    gccpl.h.
**  	12-Aug-91 (cmorris)
**  	    Added transitions to support deletion of any tuple object
**  	    descriptor on connection abort or release.
**  	15-Aug-91 (cmorris)
**  	    After we have issued/received an abort of the session
**  	    connection, no further interaction with the SL occurs.
**  	15-Aug-91 (cmorris)
**  	    Ditto for interactions with AL.
**  	16-Aug-91 (cmorris)
**  	    Fix aborts in closed state.
**	19-Nov-92 (seiwald)
**	    Changed nat's to char's in state table for compactness.
**	29-Sep-2004 (drivi01)
**	    Added LIBRARY jam hint to put this file into IMPGCFLIBDATA
**	    in the Jamfile.
**      18-Nov-2004 (Gordon.Thorpe@ca.com and Ralph.Loen@ca.com)
**          Removed LIBRARY jam hint.  This file is now included in the
**          GCC local library only.
**      17-dec-2008 (joea)
**          Replace READONLY/WSCREADONLY by const.
**	19-dec-2008 (joea)
**	    Replace GLOBALDEF const by GLOBALCONSTDEF.

** Name: PLFSM_TBL - FSM matrix
**
**
** Description:
**      There are two static data structures which together
**	define the Finite State Machine (FSM) for the PL.  They are
**	statically initialized as read only structures.  They drive the
**	operation of the PL FSM.  They are both documented here, even though
**	they are separate structures.
**
**	The FSM is a sparse matrix.  The two table mechanism is a way to deal
**	with this by not wasting too much memory on empty matrix elements, but
**	at the same time provide a simple and reasonably quick lookup scheme.
**	The first table is a matrix of integers, of the  same configuration as
**	the FSM.  Each matrix element which represents a valid FSM state/input
**	combination contains an index into the second table.  The second table
**	is a linear array whose size is exactly equal to the number of valid
**	intersections in the FSM.  Each index entry in the first table
**	references a corresponding positional entry in the second table.  This
**	latter entry specifies the new state, output events and actions which
**	are associated with the state/input intersection.  The FSM matrix is
**	specified in the preamble to the module GCCPL.C. The description is
**	actually more complicated than the mechanism.
**	
**      The following structure PLFSM_TBL is the representation of the FSM
**	matrix.  The hex values are required by CMS.

** Name: PLFSM_ENTRY - FSM matrix
**
** Description:
**      This is the linear array containing the entries for the FSM matrix.  The
**	entries in the preceeding table PLFSM_TBL are index values
**	corresponding to entries in the current array.  The array size limits on
**	the individual elements of each array entry, PL_OUT_MAX and PL_ACTN_MAX
**	are set to values which are currently adequate.  They are confined in
**	scope to the PL.  If future expansion requires these to be increased,
**	this can be done without affecting anything outside PL.  If the values
**	are changed in GCCPL.H and the PL recompiled, everything will work.
