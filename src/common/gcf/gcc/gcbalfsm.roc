** Name: PBALFSM_TBL - FSM matrix
**
**
** Description:
**      There are two static data structures which together
**	define the Finite State Machine (FSM) for the PB_AL.  They are
**	statically initialized as read only structures.  They drive the
**	operation of the PB_AL FSM.  They are both documented here, even though
**	they are separate structures.
**
**	The FSM is a sparse matrix.  The two table mechanism is a way to deal
**	with this by not wasting too much memory on empty matrix elements, but
**	at the same time provide a simple and reasonably quick lookup scheme.
**	The first table is a matrix of integers, of the  same configuration as
**	the FSM.  Each matrix element which represents a valid FSM state/input
**	combination contains an index into the second table.  The second table
**	is a linear array whose size is exactly equal to the number of valid
**	intersections in the FSM.  Each index entry in the first table
**	references a corresponding positional entry in the second table.  This
**	latter entry specifies the new state, output events and actions which
**	are associated with the state/input intersection.  The FSM matrix is
**	specified in the preamble to the module GCBAL.C. The description is
**	actually more complicated than the mechanism.
**	
**      The following structure PB_AL_FSM_TBL is the representation of the FSM
**	matrix.

**	    Added LIBRARY jam hint to put this file into IMPGCFLIBDATA
**	    in the Jamfile.
**      18-Nov-2004 (Gordon.Thorpe@ca.com and Ralph.Loen@ca.com)
**          Removed LIBRARY jam hint.  This file is now included in the
**          GCC local library only.

** Name: PBALFSM_ENTRY - FSM matrix
**
** Description:
**	This is the linear array containing the entries for the FSM matrix.
**	The entries in the preceeding table PB_AL_FSM_TBL are index values
**	corresponding to entries in the current array.  The array size limits
**	on the individual elements of each array entry, PB_OUT_MAX and
**	PB_ACTN_MAX are set to values which are currently adequate.  They are
**	confined in scope to the PBAL.  If future expansion requires these to be
**	increased, this can be done without affecting anything outside PBAL.  If
**	the values are changed in GCCPB.H and the PBAL recompiled, everything
**	will work.
