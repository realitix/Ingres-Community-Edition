** Name: GCCPBFSM.ROC - State machine for Network Bridge
**
** History: $Log-for RCS$
**	6-Mar-91 (cmorris)
**	    Created.
**	12-Jul-91 (cmorris)
**	    Fix transitions to hold onto data received before
**          Connect Confirm.
**	15-Jul-91 (cmorris)
**	    For un-updated protocol drivers, throw away completed

**  	13-Aug-91 (cmorris)
**  	    Added include of tm.h.
**      10-Jan-92 (cmorris)
**  	    Added Listen failure event and associated transitions. Previously
**          this situation shared an event with Open failure; however, the
**  	    two cases require different events/actions to be executed.
**	19-Nov-92 (seiwald)
**	    Changed nat's to char's in state table for compactness.
**	16-Feb-93 (seiwald)
**	    Don't bother including gcc.h since we don't need it.
**	06-Feb-96 (rajus01)
**	    Put the Bridge back in SBOPN state when it receives IBNCLUP
**	    event,  while it is waiting for network connections (SBWNC ).
**	29-Sep-2004 (drivi01)
**	    Added LIBRARY jam hint to put this file into IMPGCFLIBDATA
**	    in the Jamfile.
**      18-Nov-2004 (Gordon.Thorpe@ca.com and Ralph.Loen@ca.com)

** Name: PBFSM_TBL - FSM matrix
**
**
** Description:
**      There are two static data structures which together
**	define the Finite State Machine (FSM) for the PB. They are
**	statically initialized as read only structures.  They drive the
**	operation of the PB FSM.  They are both documented here, even though
**	they are separate structures.
**
**	The FSM is a sparse matrix.  The two table mechanism is a way to deal
**	with this by not wasting too much memory on empty matrix elements, but
**	at the same time provide a simple and reasonably quick lookup scheme.
**	The first table is a matrix of integers, of the  same configuration as
**	the FSM.  Each matrix element which represents a valid FSM state/input
**	combination contains an index into the second table.  The second table
**	is a linear array whose size is exactly equal to the number of valid
**	intersections in the FSM.  Each index entry in the first table
**	references a corresponding positional entry in the second table.  This
**	latter entry specifies the new state, output events and actions which
**	are associated with the state/input intersection.  The FSM matrix is
**	specified in the preamble to the module GCCPB.C. The description is
**	actually more complicated than the mechanism.
**	
**      the following structure PBFSM_TBL is the representation of the FSM
**	matrix.

** Name: PBFSM_ENTRY - FSM entry table
**
** Description:
**      This is the linear array containing the entries for the FSM matrix.  The
**	entries in the preceeding table PBFSM_TBL are index values
**	corresponding to entries in the current array.  The array size limits on
**	the individual elements of each array entry, PB_OUT_MAX and PB_ACTN_MAX
**	are set to values which are currently adequate.  They are confined in
**	scope to the PB.  If future expansion requires these to be increased,
**	this can be done without affecting anything outside PB.  If the values
**	are changed in GCCPB.H and the PB recompiled, everything will work.
