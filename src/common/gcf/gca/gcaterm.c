/**
**
**  Name: GCATERMINATE.C - Terminate GCA communications
**
**  Description:
**
**          gca_terminate - Terminate User/GCA Association
**
**  History:    $Log-for RCS$
**      15-Apr-1987 (berrow)
**          Created.
**      08-Aug-87 (jbowers)
**          Clean up svc_parms queue.
**      11-Aug-87 (jbowers)
**          Added invocation of GCdelexh to delete a previously established 
**	    exit handler.
**	25-Oct-89 (seiwald)
**	    Shortened gcainternal.h to gcaint.h.
**	26-Oct-89 (seiwald)
**	    Changed calls to gca_qenq, etc. to use QUinsert, etc.
**	01-Nov-89 (seiwald)
**	    Fixed call to QUremove() - was taking address of QUEUE pointer.
**	10-Nov-89 (seiwald)
**	    Removed references to the SVC_PARMS queue.
**	25-Jan-90 (seiwald)
**	    Reworked a bit.  Calls gca_free_acbs() to free acb list.
**	30-May-91 (seiwald)
**	    Call gca_free_acbs() before zeroing out IIGCa_static, so that
**	    the usr_dealloc is still defined.
**	07-Jan-93 (edg)
**	    Removed FUNC_EXTERN's (now in gcaint.h) and #include gcagref.h.
**      17-May-1994 (daveb) 59127
**          Fixed semaphore leaks, named sems.  In GCA, change from 
**	    using handed in semaphore routines to MU semaphores; these
**	    can be initialized, named, and removed.  The others can't
**	    without expanding the GCA interface, which is painful and
**	    practically impossible.
**	10-Oct-95 (gordy)
**	    Completion moved to gca_service().
**	20-Nov-95 (gordy)
**	    Added prototypes.  Turn of init flag so IIGCa_static will
**	    be freed in IIGCa_call().
**	21-Nov-95 (gordy)
**	    Added gcr.h for embedded Comm Server configuration.
**	 4-Dec-95 (gordy)
**	    Added support for embedded Name Server configuration.
**	 3-Sep-96 (gordy)
**	    Reorganized GCA global data.
**	 9-Sep-96 (gordy)
**	    Use STprintf() rather than MOulongout() to build the instance
**	    ID.  See gcainit.c for expanation.
**	10-Apr-97 (gordy)
**	    GCA and GC service parameters separated.
**	23-May-97 (thoda04)
**	    Included mo.h header for function prototypes.
**	29-May-97 (gordy)
**	    Shutdown GCS.
**	 2-Oct-98 (gordy)
**	    Moved MIB class definitions to gcm.h.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	15-May-08 (gordy)
**	    Cleanup resources associated with active ACBs.
**      13-Jul-2011 (hanal04) SIR 125458
**          Update cs_elog calls inline with sc0e_putAsFcn changes.

/*{
** Name: gca_terminate	- Terminate User/GCA Association
**
** Description:
**      This routine is used to reset the internal data structures set up
**	when a user (either client or server) made itself known to GCF.
**	
**	All parameters (both input and output) are handled via a pointer to
**	SVC_PARMS structure containing the following elements ...
**
**	Completion processing (gca_complete()) is performed for the current
**	request (GCA_TERMINATE).
**
** Inputs:
**	none.
**
** Outputs:
**      gca_status                      Success or failure indication.
**	    E_GC0000_OK			Normal completion
**	    E_GC0007_NO_PREV_INIT	No previous initiation request
**
** Returns:
**	None
**
** Exceptions:
**	None
**
** Side Effects:
**	None.
**
** History:
**      15-Apr-1987 (berrow)
**          Created.
**	14-jul-93 (ed)
**	    replacing <dbms.h> by <gl.h> <sl.h> <iicommon.h> <dbdbms.h>
**	14-jul-93 (ed)
**	    replacing <dbms.h> by <gl.h> <sl.h> <iicommon.h> <dbdbms.h>
**	25-aug-93 (ed)
**	    remove dbdbms.h
**	08-sep-93 (swm)
**	    Cast completion id. parameter to IIGCa_call() to PTR as it is
**	    no longer a i4, to accomodate pointer completion ids.
**	10-Oct-95 (gordy)
**	    Completion moved to gca_service().
**	20-Nov-95 (gordy)
**	    Added prototypes.  Turn of init flag so IIGCa_static will
**	    be freed in IIGCa_call().
**	 4-Dec-95 (gordy)
**	    Added support for embedded Name Server configuration.
**	 3-Sep-96 (gordy)
**	    Reorganized GCA global data.
**	 9-Sep-96 (gordy)
**	    Use STprintf() rather than MOulongout() to build the instance
**	    ID.  See gcainit.c for expanation.
**	10-Apr-97 (gordy)
**	    GCA and GC service parameters separated.
**	29-May-97 (gordy)
**	    Shutdown GCS.
**	11-May-06 (gordy)
**	    Semaphore protect the registration ACB.
**	15-May-08 (gordy)
**	    Fixed several problems associated with active ACBs: 
**	    * An ACB flagged for deletion, which will be the
**	      case for the registration ACB, has already been
**	      shutdown and should not have GCA_DISASSOC done.
**	    * A default GCA control block may not be allocated,
**	      so an explicit control block is needed to call
**	      GCA_DISASSOC.  The control block for the current
**	      request is used.
**	    * The registration ACB used for the current request
**	      needs to be freed.  This requires completion
**	      processing to be done prior to releasing the
**	      remaining ACB resources.  Make sure completion
**	      processing is done in all cases to be consistent.
**	    * Calling GCA_DISASSOC on an active listen ACB will
**	      fail.  The GC register/listen interface does not
**	      provide a clean way to clear this up other than
**	      to release local resources once GCterminate()
**	      has been called.
