/*
** Name: RsltSlct
**
** Description:
**	JDBC driver class which implements the JDBC ResultSet interface
**	as an extension of server row fetching by adding support for
**	select-loop processing.
**
**	Most of the functionality for this class is inherited from the 
**	super-classes, especially the direct super-class RsltFtch.  The 
**	only significant extension involves connection locking.  For 
**	select-loops, the connection is locked from the start of the 
**	query until the result set is closed.  The connection should
**	not be unlocked after issuing the SELECT query.
**
**	Although select loops produce a continuous data stream from the 
**	DBMS server, result-set data is still handled on a fetch request 
**	basis between the driver and server.  The server hides the 
**	difference between cursor fetches and select-loop tuple streams.
**
**  Overridden Methods:
**
**	closeCursor		Close simulated cursor.
**
**  Private Data:
**
**	locked			Connection is locked?
**
** History:
**	17-May-00 (gordy)
**	    Created.
**	27-Oct-00 (gordy)
**	    New super class which doesn't enforce connection
**	    locking or cursor oriented operations.
**	28-Mar-01 (gordy)
**	    Rename shut() to closeCursor().
**	 4-May-07 (gordy)
**	    Class is exposed outside package, permit access.
**	20-Jul-07 (gordy)
**	    Need to track connection lock state because super-class
**	    now handles EOD and auto close in more generic way.
**	    Added constructor to replace functionality of byref sub-
**	    class: loads a single initial row.

** Output:
**	None.

**	None.

**	 4-Oct-00 (gordy)
**	    Create unique ID for standardized internal tracing.
**	27-Oct-00 (gordy)
**	    New super-class constructor doesn't take cursor name.
**	15-Nov-00 (gordy)
**	    Changed parameters for JDBC 2.0 support.
**	23-Jan-01 (gordy)
**	    Changed parameter type to EdbcStmt for backward compatibility.
**	31-Oct-02 (gordy)
**	    Adapted for generic GCF driver.
**	 6-Oct-03 (gordy)
**	    Added preLoad parameter to read initial row cache from server.
**	11-Oct-05 (gordy)
**	    Handle errors during data pre-load by closing the cursor.
**	 4-May-07 (gordy)
**	    Class is exposed outside package, restrict constructor access.
**	20-Jul-07 (gordy)
**	    Super-class constructor takes max & pre-fetch sizes.  
**	    Super-class now handles EOD and auto-close conditions.
