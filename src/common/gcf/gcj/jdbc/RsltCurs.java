/*
** Name: RsltCurs
**
** Description:
**	JDBC driver class which implements the JDBC ResultSet interface
**	as an extension of server row fetching by adding support for
**	cursor processing.
**
**	Most of the functionality for this class is inherited from the 
**	super-classes, especially the direct super-class RsltFtch.  The 
**	only significant extensions involve connection locking and the
**	cursor name.  For cursors, the connection is locked only during
**	the cursor fetch and close requests.  The connection should be
**	unlocked immediately after opening the cursor.
**
**	Data sets containing BLOBs complicate the locking scheme since 
**	the cursor fetch must be interrupted on the driver side for BLOB 
**	processing.  The connection must remain locked until the BLOB 
**	has been processed and the remainder of the data set has been 
**	received.  
**
**	The super-class provides three methods which may be overridden
**	to provide connection locking: fetch(), resume(), closeCursor().  
**	The fetch() and resume() methods are used during data loading.  
**	The fetch() method is called only when the connection is dormant 
**	and leaves the connection dormant unless a BLOB column is active.  
**	The resume() methods is called when the connection is active 
**	after an active BLOB has been flushed.  Like fetch(), resume() 
**	leaves the connection dormant unless a BLOB column is active.  
**	The closeCursor() method is called only when the connection is
**	dormant and leaves the connection dormant.
**
**	The connection locking in the local implementations of fetch(),
**	resume(), and closeCursor() following the guidelines listed
**	above: locking the connection upon entry when dormant and
**	unlocking on exit if no BLOB is active.
**
**  Overridden Methods:
**
**	getCursorName	    Retrieve the associated cursor name.
**	fetch		    Fetch rows from DBMS.
**	closeCursor	    Close cursor.
**	resume		    Continue result processing after BLOB.
**
**  Private Data:
**
**	cursor		    Name of associated DBMS cursor.
**
** History:
**	14-May-99 (gordy)
**	    Created.
**	29-Sep-99 (gordy)
**	    Implemented support for BLOB data and added support
**	    methods and fields.
**	11-Nov-99 (gordy)
**	    Extracted base functionality to EdbcRslt.
**	 4-May-00 (gordy)
**	    Extracted multi-row handling to base class.
**	27-Oct-00 (gordy)
**	    Extracted server operational support to new base class
**	    while keeping control of connection locking.
**	28-Mar-01 (gordy)
**	    Renamed shut() to closeCursor().
**	 4-Aug-03 (gordy)
**	    Simplified super-class implementation removes need for
**	    local lock tracking: locked, lock() and unlock().  Super-
**	    class load() renamed to fetch().  Removed flush() as it
**	    no longer needs locking.
**	 1-Nov-03 (gordy)
**	    Made cursor name protected so available to RsltUpd sub-class
**	    to do cursor delete/update.
**	 6-Apr-07 (gordy)
**	    Override new positioned fetch().
**	 4-May-07 (gordy)
**	    Class is exposed outside package, permit access.
**	20-Jul-07 (gordy)
**	    Need to flag connection as externally locked during pre-load.
