/*
** Name: CharBuffer
**
** Description:
**	Class providing a segmented character buffer.
**
**	The character buffer is intended to represent large, 
**	variable length strings which primarily tend to grow.  
**	Data inserts and deletions are not permitted but data 
**	overwrites, extensions and truncation are allowed.
**
**	A segmented character buffer grows in fixed size blocks.  
**	The segment size may be configured when the character
**	buffer is created and defaults to 8192 characters.  Each 
**	segment has a buffer offset (node.offset), segment data 
**	(node.data), max segment length (node.data.length), and 
**	current data length (node.length).
**
**    Linked List
**
**	Segment nodes are stored in a linked list (node.next)
**	to facilitate linear scans.  A reference to the last 
**	node is also maintained which allows quick access to 
**	the last segment to calculate buffer length and append 
**	data (see Root Node below).
**
**    Binary Tree
**
**	Segment nodes are also arranged in a binary tree to 
**	facilitate quick access to a specific buffer position.  
**	The level of a node (node.level) determines the depth
**	of the node in the tree.  Leaf nodes have no child
**	subtrees and are at the lowest level of the tree.
**	Internal (non-leaf) nodes comprise the other levels 
**	of the tree.  Segments which precede an internal node 
**	are in the left child subtree (node.left).  Segments 
**	which follow an internal node are in the right child 
**	subtree (node.right).  Trees grow upwards (and to the 
**	right) from the leaf nodes and are kept semi-balanced.
**
**    Root Node
**
**	At a minimum, a buffer consists of a root node with
**	offset 0 and a max segment length of 0.  By itself,
**	the root node holds no data and represents an empty 
**	buffer.  When the buffer is not empty, the root node 
**	points to the start of the linked list (root.next) 
**	and the actual root of the binary tree (root.right).  
**	Since no data precedes the root node, the root's 
**	left subtree will always be empty.  The root's left 
**	subtree reference is hijacked (since it would other-
**	wise always be NULL) to point at the last node in 
**	the linked list (root.left).  The level of the root
**	node is chosen such that it isn't a leaf node and
**	won't appear to be the direct parent (one level up)
**	of any other node.
**	
**
**    Tree Characteristics
**
**	If an internal node's children are leaf nodes, 
**	then the node immediatly follows the left child 
**	and immediately precedes the right child.  From 
**	the child viewpoint, if a leaf node is the left 
**	child of it's parent, then it is immediately 
**	followed by it's parent.  Likewise, if a leaf 
**	node is a right child, then it is immediately 
**	preceded by it's parent.
**
**	In general, the node which immediately precedes an 
**	internal node is the right most leaf node of it's 
**	left child subtree.  The node which immediately 
**	follows an internal node is the left most leaf node 
**	of it's right child subtree.
**
**	If a leaf node is the left child of it's parent,
**	then it is immediately preceded by the first node
**	ascending the tree where a right branch is taken.  
**	Likewise, if a leaf node is a right child, then it 
**	is immediately followed by the first node ascending
**	the tree where a left branch is taken.
**
**	Leaf nodes are immediately preceded and followed
**	by internal nodes, and vica-versa.
**
**	A (sub)tree is either full, partial, or empty.  A
**	full tree is either a single leaf node or a tree
**	whose root node has full subtrees for both the left 
**	and right children and is one level higher than both
**	child subtrees.  Since trees grow (and shrink) to 
**	the right, the root node of a partial tree has a 
**	full left subtree, is one level higher than the left
**	subtree, and has an empty or partial tree for the 
**	right child.  An empty tree has no nodes.
**
**	Trees grow from the leaf nodes up.  When a tree
**	becomes full, it is extended by adding a new root
**	node with the previous root as the left child and
**	an empty right subtree.  The right subtree then
**	grows from the leaf level until it is also full.
**
**	When the first leaf node is added to an empty
**	right subtree, a level discontinuity may exist 
**	between the leaf node and the root (the root is 
**	greater than one level higher than leaf).  This 
**	discontinuity remains until the subtree grows to 
**	the correct depth.  A partial tree either contains 
**	one or more discontinuities or there is some right 
**	subtree which is empty.
**
**    Extending the Buffer
**
**	Extending the buffer entails adding another node to
**	the end of the linked list and inserting that node
**	into the binary tree.  When the last node is a non-
**	leaf node, the new node will be a leaf node and is 
**	added as the right child of the last node (possibly
**	creating a discontinuity).  When the last node is a 
**	leaf node, the new node will be a non-leaf node and 
**	the trick is finding the proper place to insert the 
**	internal node.
**	
**	When the last node is a leaf node, it is the right-
**	most node of some full (sub)tree.  A full tree is 
**	extended by adding a new root node which has the 
**	original full tree as it's left child.  If the tree 
**	is not full, there exists some right-most subtree 
**	which is full (possibly just the last (leaf) node).  
**	The full subtree containing the last segment must 
**	be identified and the root of the subtree replaced 
**	by an internal node with the full subtree as it's 
**	left child.
**
**	An internal node can only be added at a discontinuity.
**	The addition of a new node at a discontinuity reduces
**	and may eliminate the discontinuity.  A discontinuity 
**	always exists between the root buffer node and the 
**	root of the binary tree.  Additional discontinuities 
**	may exist.  The lowest discontinuity in the tree lies 
**	immediately above the full subtree containing the 
**	last segment.
**
**	The point at which an internal node is added is found
**	by scanning down the tree from the root searching for
**	discontinuities in the tree.  The new internal node
**	is added at the lowest discontinuity found. The new
**	node replaces the root of the full subtree as the
**	right child of the parent node and becomes the
**	parent node of the subtree with the subtree as it's
**	left child.
**
**    Truncating the Buffer
**
**	The degenerate case of truncating the buffer to
**	zero length is easily accomplished by initializing
**	the root node to it's initial empty state.
**
**	Truncating the buffer in general entails dropping 
**	segments from the linked list which follow the 
**	target segment and pruning the binary tree to 
**	remove nodes which follow the target segment.  
**	Nodes in the right subtree of the target node 
**	follow the target segment and are easily pruned 
**	by dropping the entire right subtree.  Non-leaf 
**	nodes above the target node may or may-not follow 
**	the target segment.  The trick is identifying and 
**	pruning the nodes above the target node which are 
**	logically to the right of the target node.
**
**	Nodes above the target node can be identified by
**	scanning down the tree from the root.  A right
**	branch is taken when the target follows a node.
**	The node should therefore not be pruned (the scan
**	simply descends).  A left branch is taken when the
**	target node preceeds a node.  The node must there-
**	fore be pruned.  The scan ends when the target
**	node is found or the branch to be taken is empty.
**	The latter case indicates the target segment did
**	not exist in the tree, that the pruning which has
**	occured is sufficient, and the node becomes the
**	last node in the buffer.
**
**	When pruning a node due to a left branch, it is
**	advantageous to note that segments in the right 
**	child subtree of the node to be pruned follow
**	the node and should also be pruned.  The node 
**	can therefore be pruned by replacing it with it's 
**	left child.  In essence, a left branch does not 
**	descend but creates (or extends) a discontinuity 
**	in the tree at that point and then continues at 
**	that point with the child of the previous node 
**	as the current node.  Since only right branchs 
**	descend, the node removed was the right child 
**	of it's parent.  From the perspective of the
**	parent node: the left child of the current
**	right child becomes the new right child.

** Name: Node
**
** Description:
**	Class which defines a segment of a character buffer.
**
**	A segment provides storage (data and length), can be linked 
**	into a list as part of a larger buffer (next segment), and 
**	can be arranged as part of a binary tree for quicker access 
**	(position offset, node level, left sub-tree, right sub-tree).
**
**	A ROOT node represents an empty segment and provides no data 
**	storage.  An empty buffer is fully represented by a single
**	ROOT node.  LEAF nodes represents the lowest level of a full
**	binary tree and have no child sub-trees.  Internal nodes may 
**	have child sub-trees and are at a tree level above the LEAF 
**	nodes.  The ROOT node is neither a LEAF nor internal node
**	(level is distinct from any other node).
**	
**
**  Constants:
**
**	ROOT			Root level.
**	LEAF			Leaf level.
**
**  Public Data:
**
**	level			Level of node in tree.
**	offset			Offset of segment.
**	length			Length of segment.
**	data			Segment data.
**	next			Next node in list.
**	left			Left sub-tree.
**	right			Right sub-tree.
**
**  Private Data:
**
**	empty			Empty data array.

** History:
