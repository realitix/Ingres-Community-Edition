/*
** Name: Timer
**
** Description:
**	Class which provides the ability to asynchronously perform
**	an action after a specified amount of time has expired.
**	Uses the Callback interface to perform the desired action.
**
**	The timer is implemented as a separate thread and should be
**	started by calling the start() method inherited from the
**	Thread class.  The timer may be cancelled by calling the
**	interrupt() method.  If, after calling start(), the time
**	expires, a callback is made, in the context of the timer
**	thread, to perform whatever action is desired.  The Callback
**	interface is used to define the callback method: timeExpired().
**
** History:
**	16-Nov-99 (gordy)
**	    Created.
**	18-Nov-99 (gordy)
**	    Brought in Alarm as a nested interface.
**	18-Apr-00 (gordy)
**	    Renamed Alarm to Callback.

**
** Description:
**	Interrupts the timer and disables the callback.  Overrides

**	to the start() method, the timer will be disable completely.
**	If called prior to timer expiration, the timer thread will be
**	iterrupted an no callback will occur.
