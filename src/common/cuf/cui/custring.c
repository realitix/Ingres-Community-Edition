/*{
** Name: cus_trmwhite 	- Trim trailing white space.
**
** Description:
**      Used by the parser facility for trimming trailing white space
**      in character texts residing in memory. The text may be null terminated
**	but doesn't have to be. This is the reason why the length argument
**	is passed along with the buffer pointer. This routine is currently
**	only used in calls to psf_error to make text presented to recipients
**	of error messages more user friendly.
**
** Inputs:
**      len				Max length to be scanned for white space
**	bufp				Pointer to the buf holding char data
**					(does not have to be null terminated)
** Outputs:
**	Returns:
**	    Length			Length of non-white part of the string
**
**	Exceptions:
**	    None.
**
** Side Effects:
**	    None.
**
** History:
**	11-apr-87 (stec)
**          written
**	16-apr-87 (stec)
**	    changed a little.
**	    Addressed performance and Kanji issues.
**	02-may-1990 (fred)
**	    Revamped to trim trailing white space from an arbitrary string.
**	    Previously, it was assumed that trailing white space started
**	    with the first bit o' white space from the beginning.  The routine
**	    will now trim from the end back.  This was necessitated for BLOB
**	    support which is the first case of a datatype name with an embedded
**	    blank (standard name - 'long varchar').
**	25-mar-93 (rickh)
**	    Moved here from PSFTRMWH.C and renamed with a cuf prefix.
