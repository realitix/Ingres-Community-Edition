**
** 	All CUT_INT_BUFs are linked together in a master buffer linked list,
**	there is one CUT_INT_BUF per active buffer in CUT.
**	
**	Each buffer contains a list of CUT_BUF_THREAD  structures, there is
**	one CUT_BUF_THREAD strcuture for each thread that is attached to each
**	buffer.
**
**	All CUT_TCBs are linked togehter in a master thread linked list, there
**	is one CUT_TCB for each thread that is active in CUT.
**
**	Each CUT_TCB contains a list of CUT_BUF_THREAD strcutures which describe
**	all of the buffers that thread is attached to. As the diagram shows,
**	these CUT_BUF_THREAD structures are the same as the ones hanging from
**	the CUT_INT_BUF, and the linked lists overlap.
**	
**	The CUT_BUF_THREAD structure contains a pointer to both the next
**	CUT_BUF_THREAD attached to the current buffer and the next 
**	CUT_BUF_THREAD attached to this thread (CUT_TCB).

** Name CUT_INT_BUF - CUT internal description of a buffer
**
** Description:
**	This structure contains the information about a communications buffer
**	that is internal to the CUT functions, this includes the semaphore
**	used to access the buffer, and other statistical information.
**	a generic pointer to this structure will be returned to the user
**	in the cut_buf_handle field in the CUT_RCB. There will be one of
**	these structures for each active buffer in CUT
**
**	Design Note:
**	The conditions on buffers fall broadly into two catagories, a read
**	condition (wait for tail to move forward, or buffer full wait), and
**	a write condition (wait for head to move forward, or buffer empty
**	wait). Since a condition free action may only wake a single thread,
**	and read threads can do nothing to help write threads (and vice-versa),
**	except, perhaps, re-signal the condition, it was decided to have
**	two conditions within the buffer. This way a thread may wait on the 
**	read condition or the write condition, and may signal either
**	indipendently. This means that we will not wake a thread waiting for
**	a read condition when we have completed a write action (and 
**	vice-versa), thus ensuring we don't get stuck by only waking a 
**	thread that can't help. Note that both conditions use the same
**	semaphore (is this legal ?).
**
**	Typically in a reader/writer setup, one end will be consistently
**	faster than the other.  When this happens, the faster end will
**	end up sleeping and being awakened on every cell, which is slow.
**	The reader/writer wakeup points reduce this thrashing by
**	deferring wakeup until the buffer cell read or write count has
**	reached a specified level.
**
**	Note on Semaphores:
**	There are two semaphores of interest involved in maintaining buffers,
**	the fisrt is the buffer list semaphore, which protects the linked list
**	of buffers (this is a static variable in cutinterf.c). The second
**	semaphore protects the buffer itself. To avoid semaphore deadlocks
**	and other mutex related inconsistencies, the following protocol should
**	be followed before working on any buffer:
**
**		 - Grab buffer list sem
**		 - Check for buffer in list
**		 - Grab buffer sem
**		 - Release buffer list sem
** History:
**	09-Sep-2004 (jenjo02)
**	    Added cut_trace boolean for some primitive r/w tracing.
**	27-Nov-2007 (jonj)
**	    Add cut_writers_attached boolean.

/*
** Name: CUT_TCB - CUT Thread control block
**
** Description:
**	The structure contains all the CUT control information for a thread.
**	There will be one of these structure for each thread that is active
**	in CUT.
**
** 	Notes on semaphores: 
**	The data in this control block, and the list of CUT_THREAD control
**	blocks that it points to needs no semaphore protection because, by
**	definition, only one thread will be accessing it at a time. THIS
**	SITUATION CHANGES IF A THREAD CAN ACCESS ANOTHER THREADS DATA.
**	The only exception to this is the error case (when thread status is
**	being checked or set), at this time, this will be the only semaphore
**	held.
**
**	If thread master list semaphore, the buffer master list semaphore 
**	and a buffer semaphore are all required. In order to avoid dealocks
**	and other semaphore related problems, the caller must grab the
**	thread master list semaphore first, and then follow the semaphore
**	protocol describe in CUT_INT_BUF for the other semaphores.
**
**	Note on Session ID
**	In all of the CUT code, a CS_SID is assumed to be a single data-type
**	that has been defined or typedef'd in the CL (i.e. it is not a 
**	structure). This holds for all known platforms that Ingres runs on.
**	The values of CS_SID will be 32 bits or 64 bits on the relavent 
**	architectures with Ingres threads, or system returned thread number
**	when using OS threads (normaly an int). Either way, CS_SID's can be
**	comapred to eachother without having to use MEcmp(), we will assume
**	we can simply say "if (sid1 == sid2)".
