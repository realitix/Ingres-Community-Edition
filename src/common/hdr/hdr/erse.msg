**	    Changed value of E_SE0008.
**	11/20/91 (dkh) - ER changes for internationalization.
**	13-mar-1994 (emerson)
**	    Added S_SE0036_BAD_ARRAY.

**		Added E_SE0038_NO_RUN_LICENSE and E_SE0039_NO_DEV_LICENSE.
**	21-aug-98 (dansa02) Bugs 90780, 90783
**		Added E_SE003A_APP_ALREADY_EXISTS, E_SE003B_CANT_FETCH_APP_VER,

**		NOTE that only E_SE003D has the true ER parameter format (with
