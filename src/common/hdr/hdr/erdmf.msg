**	be properly converted.  If a user table was affected, the database
**	should be available, but further errors will occur on the table

** Recommendation:
**	If a DBMS catalog was affected, the problem must be resolved before
**	the new version of the DBMS can access the database. For all other
**	tables the user may be able to modify or reload the table. Secondary
**	indexes should be dropped and recreated.  If all else fails, the

** Parameters:
**	None.
**
** Explanation:

**      %0c      - database name
**      %1c	 - checkpoint file name
**      %2c      - location name
**
** Explanation:
**	If during a rollforward it is found that a checkpoint file
**	associated with a specific location is not found, this error
**	is issued.  This is expected in the current release
**	if the location has been created since the last checkpoint.
**
** System Status:
**	If a new location was added to the database since the last
**	checkpoint, this is an expected condition.  If not, the
**	rollforward will likely fail.  This error in itself does not
**	cause the recovery to fail.
**
** Recommendation:
**	If the checkpoint has been inadvertently deleted, restore it.
**	If the checkpoint is bad, attempt recovery from a prior
**	checkpoint.

** Parameters:
**	None.
**
** Explanation:
**	During an online checkpoint, the DBMS writes a copy of the config
**	file to the database DUMP directory (II_DUMP).  When restoring
**	to that checkpoint, the config file is overwritten with the
**	contents in the DUMP copy.
**
**	This error is raised when rollforwarddb is unable to restore the

**	errors, permission errors, or if the config copy is missing.
**
**	The DUMP copy of the config file will be named "cnnnnnn.dmp" where
**	"nnnnnn" is the checkpoint sequence number.
**
**	This message should be preceded by more detailed error messages
**	in the error log giving the exact nature of the error.
**
** System Status:
**	Rollforward processing aborts.
**
** Recommendation:
**	Check previous error messages to determine if the problem can be
**	resolved by fixing system conditions (freeing disk space, bringing
**	disk volume on-line, etc.).  If the problem seems to be that config
**	file copy is corrupted, then the checkpoint may not be usable.  It is
**	possible that using a different copy of the config file will resolve
**	the problem.

"The indicated checkpoint has been marked INVALID. A checkpoint may
be marked INVALID if the backup operation failed due to a disk or

an online checkpoint may be marked invalid if the Archiver was
unable to copy the journal and dump file information to the journal
and dump directories (check the Archiver error log for messages).
You can restore your database from the most recent valid checkpoint
by issuing the rollforwarddb command with the '#c' argument. In a
future release this action will be taken automatically."
/*%
** Parameters:
**	None.
**
** Explanation:
**	This message is issued by the rollforwarddb utility when the checkpoint
**	which was to be used is discovered to be unusable. In order for a
**	checkpoint to be usable for rolling forward a database, the backup
**	operation must have successfully written all the locations which
**	comprise the database to the backup area (whether disk or tape).
**
**	Additionally, if the checkpoint was an online checkpoint, the archiver
**	must have successfully copied all the transaction and backup information
**	from the transaction log file to the journal and dump files associated 
**	with this checkpoint.
**
**	If any or all of these operations fail, the checkpoint is marked as
**	INVALID and cannot be used for rolling forward the database.
**
** System Status:
**	The rollforwarddb operation is aborted. The database is unaltered. No
**	action has been taken on the database.
**
** Recommendation:
**	Depending on what has been done with this database in the past, there
**	may be a valid checkpoint earlier in the history of this database. The
**	infodb utility may be used to display the checkpoint history of this
**	database. If a previous checkpoint is marked as valid, the database
**	can be recovered by rolling forward from the previous checkpoint.
**
**	You can restore your database from the most recent valid checkpoint by
**	re-issuing the rollforwarddb command with the "#c" argument.
**
**	If the "#c" argument is used, the database will be rolled back to the
**	most recent valid checkpoint, and the database will be rolled forward
**	by re-applying all transactions which have been executed since the
**	checkpoint was taken. The transaction information is kept in the

**	ROLLFORWARDDB recovers the dsc_last_table_id field of the config
**	file by replacing it with the original config file version.
**	However, ROLLFORWARDDB also provides a second, independent means of 
**	tracking the recovery of this field through table creation 
**	log records.  This error is issued when the two values conflict.  
**
** System Status:
**	No change.  This is as a consistency check and is not an expected
**	condition.
**
** Recommendation:
**	Run verifydb against the database, including dbms catalogs, after the 
**	recovery completes.  This should detect table id conflicts.
**
**	Also, notify Actian Corporation Technical Support.  Save 
**	"auditdb -all" output run against the database journal files, 
**	and a copy of the database INFODB output.  Also, save the copies 
**	of the config files on the database, journal and dump directories 
**	(all files named "aaaaaaaaa").

of rollforward.  Rollforward will not proceed unless the '#f' flag has been

** Explanation:
**	A rollforwarddb is being done on a database which has had incomplete

**
**	Since journaling are incomplete, the database journal information

**	Check the error log for the specific reason for failure.  If the
**	cause is the journal file filling up, the following sequence of
**	operations are suggested:
**
**	  1) Disable journaling via "alterdb -j <database>".
**
**	  2) Either free up space on the disk on which the journal resides, or
**	     relocate the journal location either through the use of symbolic

**	     is down, by the modification of the journal location via accessdb.
**
**	  3) Checkpoint the database via "ckpdb +j" to reenable journaling.

**
** Explanation:
**	As the DBMS server starts up, it dereferences all the II_WORKDIR_xx_nn

**	Each of these logicals must be a full valid directory specification
**	(i.e., partial specifications are not allowed).  For example, under the

**
** Recommendation:
**	Examine the currently defined set of work-area logicals.  These are

**	In order to check a hash table, we must know how many main pages there

/*%
** Parameters:
**	None.
**
** Explanation:
**	An error was encountered while converting the config file from 6.0
**	to 6.3 format.  This could due to: an I/O error; the config
**	file could need to be extended, and there is no disk space; the
**	server could have run out of memory; or there could be a format
**	error in the old config file.  There should be a previous error

**
**	This problem should only occur the first time a database that was
**	created by Release 6.0 is opened by Release 6.3. When this is done,
**	the system automatically converts the 6.0 config file to 6.3 format.
**
** System Status:
**	The database will not be accessible by release 6.3 until it can be

**      information in the iiextend catalog (which is where accessdb gets
**      its information) did not match internal database information from the

/*%
** Parameters:
**	%0c - database Name
**	%1c - table Name
**	%2d - page Number
**
** Explanation:
**	This is an indication that a page checksum has failed.  Page checksum 
**	failures occur most often as a result of hardware failures, but 
**	may also occur as a result of a bug in the server.  
**
** System Status:
**	The transaction or statement which encountered this error is aborted.
**	The page is not read into cache.
**
** Recommendation:
**	First it should be determined if hardware problems are causing
**	the checksum errors (VMS "show device" or UNIX /usr/adm/messages).
**	If it appears that hardware problems are the cause, the 
**	errors will likely disappear when the problem is resolved.
**
**	If checksum problems persist, the only fully supported technique 
**	for resolving the problem is to run rollforwarddb on the database.  
**
**	Unsupported trace points are available to disable checksumming and
**	to report checksum errors to II_DBMS_LOG without having errors returned
**	to the caller.  Use of these trace points is dangerous, however, as
**	they effectively tell the DBMS to ignore bad data on a page.  Contact
**	Actian Corporation Technical Support for more information on 
**	trace points and related actions.
**
**	There is a small chance that checksum errors may occur as a result
**	of a bug in the server.  If it appears that this is the case, the user 
**	should save all relevant information, including system console
**	information, and report the problem to Actian Corporation Technical 
**	Support.

**
** Explanation:
**	The buffer manager's internal count of the number of servers connected

**
** Recommendation:
**	Restart the servers -- examine the error log to see the reason why

**
** Explanation:
**	A VARCHAR or TEXT datatype has been encountered that has a length

** Parameters:

**	%3d - TID of bad row
**
** Explanation:
**	A bad row was encountered in the database that could not be
**	interpreted by DMF.
**
**	If the error is returned on an insert, then the bad row will not be
**	added to the database.  If this error is returned on a select, then

**
** System Status:
**	The query will be rejected in the normal case, and the transaction
**	will be aborted.  The error recovery actions can be altered by the
**	trace flags described below.
**
** Recommendation:
**	If this error is returned on a SELECT statement then there is probably
**	a bad row in the database.  The user should do a select by TID of the
**	reported row to make sure that it really is bad.  The table should be
**	recovered -- methods for doing this are described below.
**
**	The supported method of fixing a table like this is to recover it from
**	the last checkpoint.  If this is not practical or possible, the table
**	can be patched by removing the offending row.  There are two trace
**	flags provided for this -- these are undocumented trace flags that are
**	not intended to be distributed for general use!
**
**	SET TRACE POINT DM801 will cause DMF to skip bad rows like this when
**	scanning the table.  Thus, the user could do:
**
**	        set trace point DM801
**	        modify table to storage_structure
**
**	which would have the effect of rebuilding the table without any
**	of the offending rows.
**
**	SET TRACE POINT DM802 will cause DMF to return a garbage row when a
**	bad row is encountered.  This allows the user to do:
**
**	        set trace point DM802
**	        delete table where table.tid = BAD_TID
**	        set notrace point DM802
**
**	This will delete the offending row directly. This is the only operation
**	that should be attempted while having this trace flag on, as it may
**	cause unexpected and unpredictable results if used while SELECTing a
**	bad row.

rather than mark any databases inconsistent.  Previous messages in the
error log and the RCP log file may help diagnose the recovery problems.
If the problem is resource- or environment-related, the problem should be fixed
and the system restarted.  Otherwise, II_DMFRCP_STOP_ON_INCONS_DB should
be unset (or deassigned) and the RCP allowed to mark the database(s)
inconsistent.  A rollforward will be required in this case."

** Parameters:
**	None.
**
** Explanation:
**	The II_DMFRCP_STOP_ON_INCONS_DB environment variable is used
**	to request that the installation be shut down 
**	rather than mark a database inconsistent.  This error
**	is generated when such a situation occurs.  That is,

**
** System Status:
**	The system is down and subsequent recoveries will fail until

** Recommendation:
**	It is incumbent upon the system operator to examine the RCP
**	log file data and any other available diagnostic information
**	(e.g., (Unix) /usr/adm/messages, (VMS) console error log)
**	to determine if the cause of the inconsistent database
**	can be fixed.  Possible problems and resulting actions are as

**
**	       Problem                        Solution
**
**	  1) RCP ran out of               Free up space on disk

**
**	  2) VMS quota exceeded           Increase quota and

**
**	  3) RCP ran out of 		  Reconfigure the DBMS to

**	  4) Operator error               If possible, reverse
**	                                  the operator action and retry
**	                                  the startup attempt.
**
**	  5) Disk hard failure,           a) Unset II_DMFRCP_STOP_ON_INCONS_DB,

** Parameters:
**	%0c - name of the crash log located in the files directory.
**
** Explanation:
**	If the server is about to crash as a result of an internally
**	detected problem and no II_DBMS_LOG has been defined, a "crash
**	log" will be created.  This error messages indicates that
**	indeed this case has been encountered, and includes

that does not coincide with the current logged operation.  Page LSN:
<%4x,%5x>, log record LSN <%6x,%7x>, page status %3x.  During Page
Oriented Recovery, the page being recovered must be in a state consistent
with the logged operation.  In undo recovery, a page LSN which is less than
the log record LSN implies that updates may have been lost or that redo
recovery did not properly restore the state of the database."
/*%
** Parameters:
**	%0c     - table name
**	%1c     - table owner
**	%2d     - page number
**	%3x     - page status
**	%4x,%5x - page LSN
**	%6x,%7x - log record LSN
**
** Explanation:
**	During Page Oriented Recovery, there is a dependence upon
**	pages being in exactly the state expected during undo and rollforward
**	recovery.
**
**	Page states are tracked by their LSNs.  An LSN is a unique log record
**	identifier and is usually equivalent to the Log Address of the record.
**	Whenever a page is updated, the LSN of the log record that describes
**	the update is written to the page.  The LSN, therefore, indicates the
**	the chronological state of the page.
**
**	A page with an LSN less than that of an associated log record is in a 
**	state PREVIOUS to when the logged update was applied.  That is to say,
**	the update HAS NOT been applied to the page.
**
**	A page with an LSN greater or equal to that of an associated log record
**	must have had the update applied to it.
**
**	During undo recovery, the page LSN must be at least equal to that of
**	the log record LSN so that the update can be un-applied.  If it is
**	not, then updates to the page must have been lost and not restored
**	during redo processing.
**
**	During rollforward recovery, the page state is expected to always be
**	previous to the log records being applied.  If it is not, then the
**	database must not have been properly restored to a valid checkpoint.
**
** System Status:
**	During undo recovery, the operation will fail, and the database may
**	be marked inconsistent. 
**
** Recommendation:
**	Check the error log for any related error messages that may give
**	a reason for the failure.  If possible save the RCP log, the 
**	error log, and the output from a logdump operation to assist

**	point window, the archiver found an End Transaction record for a
**	transaction which had no corresponding Begin Transaction record.

E_DM9838_ARCH_DB_BAD_LA:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR
"The Archiver detected a bad log address in the database configuration file."
/*%
** Parameters:
**	None.
**
** Explanation:
**	This message is issued by the dmfacp process when it detects an internal
**	error. The archiver keeps track of each database's archiving activity
**	in a special file known as the database configuration file (named
**	aaaaaaaa.cnf). In this file, the archiver stores the log address of the
**	last log record which was copied to the journals for this database.
**	Transaction log addresses are ever-increasing 8-byte integers, and 
**	the log address which the archiver reads from the configuration 
**	file should never exceed the log address in the current log file. 
**	If it does, the archiver issues this message and stops processing.
**
**	The most likely reason for encountering this error is that the log
**	file was re-initialized and the system time was erroneous, resulting
**	in log file addresses which were not ever-increasing.
**
** System Status:
**	The archiver stops processing. Detailed information about the database
**	that encountered this error and the log address which was erroneous
**	is logged in the ACP log file.
**
** Recommendation:
**	Run infodb for this database, and note the values which infodb
**	displays for the last log address journaled for this database. If this
**	is a VAX/VMS Cluster installation, also note the last log address
**	information for each cluster node. Next, run logstat, and note the
**	current log file EOF position. Observe that the last log address value
**	exceeds the current EOF.
**
**	Now contact Actian Corporation Technical Support and report this problem. You will
**	be given advice on how to repair the problem. (Internal note: The best
**	recovery action is probably to patch the jnl_la or cnode_la in the
**	config file back down to the current EOF, then to IMMEDIATELY take
**	a checkpoint of the database.)

/*%
** Parameters:
**	%0c - type of resource failure: "logging", "locking", or "memory".
**	%1c - specific logging/locking resource to be increased.
**
** Explanation:
**	The archiver could not allocate a resource necessary for processing.
**
**	Types of resource failure are:
**
**	  Logging - Could not start transaction for archive processing.
**	            Logging system configuration should be altered to
**	            increase maximum number of concurrent transactions.
**	  Locking - Could not allocate lock-list for archive processing.
**	            Locking system configuration should be altered to
**	            increase the number of lock-lists.
**	  Memory  - Could not allocate memory for archive processing.
**	            This may be due to process quotas or actual system
**	            resources.  On VMS systems, quotas on the ACP should
**	            be examined to determine if they can be increased
**	            (See the utility script RUN_ACP.COM).  If
**	            system memory is exhausted, the system load may
**	            need to be decreased.
**
**	Since most resource exhaustions are temporary and occur at peak
**	loads, the archiver can often be restarted immediately without
**	actually having to reconfigure the system.  Some resources may
**	be recovered by decreasing the amount of concurrent activity to
**	the DBMS.

/*%
** Parameters:
**	%0d - table ID
**	%1d - index ID
**	%2c - table name
**	%3c - database name
**
** Explanation:
**	This message is issued when an internal logic error is detected within
**	the DBMS server. When a table is being closed by the server,
**	all pages within the table must be cleaned up first. Part of closing
**	the table involves a scan of the server's page buffer cache. During
**	this scan, a page was found belonging to a secondary index, but the
**	secondary index information was missing from the server's memory
**	control blocks. This message records that secondary index information
**	exists for a particular secondary index on the erroneous table.

**	%9x - internal locking system status code
**
** Explanation:
**	An internal logic error has been detected by the DBMS server.
**	When a cached database page is being validated by the server, the
**	server queries the locking system for the current page version
**	number to determine whether the cached copy is valid or not. For a
**	page which is currently FIXED and therefore in use, the server expects

contains an overflow chain.  When a leaf has an overflow chain then only
keys which all have the same duplicate value can be placed there.  The DBMS
could not determine whether this key could be placed on the allocated leaf
instead of a btree split being done."
/*%
** Parameters:
**	None.
**
** Explanation:
**	This error occurred during an insert to a btree leaf which contains

%2d logical locks, and the maximum number of locks allowed is %3d.  The

/*%
** Parameters:
**	%0x - lock-list status flags
**	%1x - request flags
**	%2d - number of logical locks currently held
**	%3d - maximum number of logical locks allowed
**
** Explanation:
**	Logical locks are the locks used by the DBMS for concurrency control and
**	transaction serialization (as opposed to physical locks, which are used
**	internally for purposes such as cache coherency and table version
**	control). Each transaction is limited in the number of logical locks
**	it can acquire, to prevent a single transaction from monopolizing the
**	resources of the entire system. This lock request is being denied
**	because the transaction has reached its resource limit.
**
** System Status:
**	The DBMS will attempt to escalate to table-level locking on this table,
**	which reduces lock resource usage. Other processing continues normally.
**
** Recommendation:
**	A transaction which routinely exhausts its logical lock limit should
**	be reviewed to see if it can be written more efficiently.  If the 
**	per-transaction lock limit is indeed too small, increase it by 
**	increasing the value of the ii.*.rcp.lock.per_tx_limit config.dat

"Server has exited abnormally while connected to a Shared Cache causing an

/*%
** Parameters:
**	None.
**
** Explanation:
**	The buffer manager keeps an internal count of the number of servers
**	which are connected to it.  When servers start up or shut down, they
**	are expected to increment/decrement this count accordingly.
**
**	Each server connected to a buffer manager holds a shared buffer manager
**	lock on its server lock-list.  At strategic times (server startup and
**	at consistency points), servers will check the number of holders
**	of the buffer manager lock and compare it with the connect count.
**	If the counts do not match, some server has exited without adjusting
**	the connect count.
**
**	This is currently considered a fatal error, as the buffer manager is
**	left in an unpredictable state -- lists may be trashed and data may
**	be corrupt.
**
**	When this message is displayed, it means that DMF is shutting down the
**	server.
**
** System Status:
**	Server is shut down.  All other servers connected to this same buffer
**	manager will also be shut down automatically.
**
** Recommendation:
**	Restart servers -- examine log to see reason why original server exited
**	abnormally.  This could have happened due to a server fatal error or
**	because the user stopped the DBMS server process rather than shutting
**	it down normally.

**	status to the dmfrcp process. The server shutdown will let redo
**	recovery rebuild the database contents.
**
**	In most circumstances, additional diagnostic information will
**	have been written to II_DBMS_LOG prior to the shutdown.
**
** Recommendation:
**	Restart the server to determine if the problem is reproducible.
**	In any case, save the error log and II_DBMS_LOG information
**	and contact Actian Corporation Technical Support.
