** Name:	erwt.msg -	Message file for class IT
**
** Description:
**	This file defines the messages for class IT.
**
** History:
**	Revision 6.2  89/07  wong
**	Added E_WT0020_MaxIL for JupBug #6367.
**
**	Revision 6.0  87/08/10  arthur
**	Initial revision.
**
**	25-jan-1991 (Joe)
**	    Added some errors for Windows 4GL.
**	28-jan-1991 (Joe)
**	    Added errors for dynamic calls.
**	30-apr-1991 (sandyd)
**	    Changed WT_CLASS from 49 to 210 to avoid collision with old ABF.
**	11/20/91 (dkh) - ER changes for internationalization.
**	5-feb-1993 (emerson)
**	    Added E_WT0057_INTERNAL_ERROR and E_WT0058_INVALID_IL_OPCODE.
**	10-apr-1993 (emerson)
**	    Modified E_WT0025_WAITFOR_NOTTOP to reflect the fact that
**	    WaitFor may now be issued from within a procedure.
**	    E_WT0026_WAITFOR_NOTFRM is probably now obsolete.
**	9-sep-1993 (emerson)
**	    Added E_WT005D - E_WT0065 for prochandles.
**	19-sep-1993 (emerson)
**	    Removed the line number and frame name from E_WT0024 and E_WT0025,
**	    since they are always preceded by E_WT0029_ERRLOCATION, which
**	    displays the line number and frame name.  Also corrected
**	    the wording of E_WT0024.
**	25-oct-1993 (emerson)
**	    Changed the wording of E_WT0028_BLOCKRETURN to correspond to
**	    various changes in the way E_WT0028 and E_WT0029 are printed.
**	    See IIITreturnEx in ilcall.c for details.
**	27-nov-1993 (emerson)
**	    Added E_WT0066_NULL_TO_NONNULL, to handle those cases where
**	    the interpreter detects this error rather than ADF.
**	    (It's equivalent to E_AD1012_NULL_TO_NONNULL).
**	30-nov-1993 (emerson)
**	    Removed the attribute name from the E_WT0031_NULLATTR message,
**	    since it's not available with the new IL_FASTATTR.
**	    Replaced E_WT0058_INVALID_IL_OPCODE by E_WT0067_INVALID_IL_OPCODE.
**	    (E_WT0067_INVALID_IL_OPCODE has a parameter for the opcode).
**	28-dec-1993 (emerson)
**	    Removed the method name from the E_WT003B_NULLMETHOD message,
**	    since it's not available with the new IL_FASTMETHOD.
**	    Added E_WT002F_NOPROC for IL_FASTMETHOD.  (It's similar to
**	    E_WT003A_NOPROC but displays the method number instead of name).
**	31-dec-1993 (emerson)
**	    Changed my mind:  I decided that the E_WT002F_NOPROC condition
**	    was so implausible an internal error that it wasn't worth
**	    the overhead of checking for it, so I removed the message.
**	13-mar-1994 (emerson)
**	    Added F_WT000B_local_procedure, F_WT000C_method,
**	    F_WT000D_dynamic_expression, F_WT000E_application,
**	    E_WT0068_CANNOT_INSTANTIATE,
**	    E_WT0069_TOO_MANY_VARS_COMPILE,
**	    E_WT006A_DYNDECL_COMPILE_FAIL, and
**	    E_WT006B_EXPR_TOO_COMPLEX_WIN.
**	26-apr-1996 (rogerwh)
**	    Added W_WT006C_CASE_NO_MATCH runtime warning for case statement.
**	10-feb-1998 (donc)
**	    Added generic External Object errors
**	7-dec-1999 (crido01) SIR 99619 
**	    Added E_WT006E_R4GLPC_NULL_APPSRV
**		  E_WT006F_R4GLPC_INVALID_APPSRV
**	19-mar-2003 (crido01) 
**	   Fix up grammar in 0070 error
**      20-Jun-2005 (hanal04) Bug 114700 INGSRV3337
**          Ingres message file cleanup.
