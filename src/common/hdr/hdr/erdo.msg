" - An error occurred while reading file: '%0c'.\n%1c"

** Explanation:
**      An invalid UTF-8 encoding was detected. The export file being
**      imported does not consist entirely of valid UTF-8 encodings. Such
**      a file may contain a mixture of ASCII and extended ASCII bytes.
**      Acceptable ASCII bytes fall in the range between hex values 0x00
**      and 0x7F, while extended ASCII bytes between 0x80 and 0xFF cannot
**      be imported.
**
** System Status:
**      The application or component will not be imported.
**
** User Action:
**      Change the file so that it contains only valid UTF-8 encodings and
**      then import the file again. Exporting to XML format using the XML
**      export feature will ensure that application and component export
**      files can be reimported cleanly into OpenROAD environments that
**      support Transparent Unicode. For more information, see the OpenROAD
**      Workbench User Guide.
