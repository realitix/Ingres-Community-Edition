E_WR0000_NOSUCHDB	"Error connecting to database '%0c'."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	The application could not successfully connect to the named database
**	most likely because the database does not exist, or possibly because
**	the commands specified using the ING_SET environment logical are
**	incorrect.
**
**	Occasionally, successful database connection may be precluded by
**	other errors (e.g., GCA errors, etc.) usually evidence of some sort
**	of installation problem or hardware or system failure.
**
** System Status:
**	The application will not start up.
**
** User Action:
**	Check that the database name was specified correctly and re-enter
**	the command line.  Also, check that the commands specified using
**	the ING_SET logical are correct.

E_WR0002_ALLOCFRM	"Cannot initialize ABF form.\n
The ABF run-time system could not initialize the form '%1c', which is
used internally.  This is an installation problem.  Please report it
to your technical support representative."

E_WR0003_PRMTYPE	"Value passed to parameter of incompatible type.\n
A value of type '%4c' was passed to the parameter '%2c' in the %1c '%0c'.  The
type '%4c' is not compatible with the type of the parameter, '%3c'."
 
/*%
** Explanation:
**	A value was passed to a parameter in a frame or procedure that did

E_WR0005_KEYTOHOST	"Named parameters passed to host-language procedure.\n
The host-language procedure '%0c' was called with parameters specified by name
(i.e., of the form param1 = arg1, param2 = arg2, ...) as if it were an 4GL

*/

E_WR0007_ABNULLPRM	"Possible Null value passed to non-Null parameter.\n
A value of Nullable type was passed to the parameter '%2c', which is not
Nullable, in the %1c '%0c'.  This will result in a run-time error when a Null
value is passed to this parameter.  Use the 'ifnull()' function when passing
this value to ensure that a run-time error will not occur."
 
/*%
** Explanation:
**	A value of a Nullable type is being passed to a parameter that has been
**	declared as being not Nullable.  Passing a Null value to this parameter
**	will result in a run-time error.  Since this value could be Nullable
**	you can use the 'ifnull()' function to pass it, which will guarantee
**	that a Null value is never passed to the non-Null parameter.
**
** System Status:
**	If the value is not Null, it will be passed to the parameter; otherwise
**	a run-time error will occur and the parameter will be undefined.

E_WR0008_ABNULLBYREF	"Possible Null value returned by reference.\n
The parameter '%0c' is a Nullable type in the current %1c and is being returned
by reference to a non-Nullable field.  This will result in a run-time error when
a Null value is returned by reference to this field.  Define the parameter to
be non-Nullable to ensure that a run-time error will not occur."
 
/*%
** Explanation:
**	A parameter that is a Nullable type is being returned by reference to
**	a field that is not Nullable.  At some point, if the parameter contains
**	a Null value and is returned by reference, a run-time error will occur.
**
** System Status:
**	If not Null, the parameter will be returned by reference; otherwise
**	a run-time error will occur and the value of the field will be

*/

E_WR000B_NOINIFRM	"Unable to initialize form for frame.\n
The form '%1c' for the frame '%0c' could not be initialized.  The frame will
not be executed."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	The Forms System returned an error when the ABF run-time system
**	tried to initialize a form for a frame before calling the frame.
**	Possibly, this is because the form does not exist, or its name was
**	typed incorrectly on the User Frame definition form.
**
** System Status:
**	The called frame will not be run.

E_WR000D_ABRETFRM	"Return value expected from non-4GL frame.\n
The frame '%0c' was called expecting it to return a value.  Since it is
a '%1c' frame, it cannot return a value."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	Frames such as QBF or Report frames that are not "User" frames (i.e.,
**	that are not defined by 4GL source code) do not return values to frames
**	that call them.
**
** System Status:
**	The field designated to hold the return value has an undefined value.
**
** User Action:
**	Delete the code assigning the return value from the frame.
*/

E_WR000E_ABNULLOBJ	"Undefined routine for %1c '%0c'.\n
The internal ABF run-time structures contain a NULL reference for the routine
for the %1c '%0'.  Please report this internal problem to your technical
support representative."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	The ABF run-time system found a NULL reference to a routine in its
**	internal structures when the application tried to call or run an 4GL
**	frame or procedure.  (This routine contains the executable code for
**	the frame or procedure.)  ABF should generate a symbol for this routine,
**	both in the internal run-time structures that it builds and in the code
**	generated for the frame or procedure, when an application is built.
**	Otherwise, this is an internal programming problem.
**
**	In versions before release 6, this error could occur when the source
**	files for a frame and a procedure shared a common file name but had
**	different extensions (e.g., "xyz.osl" and "xyz.c".)  Then, the resultant
**	object files would collide, most likely overwriting the code for the
**	frame's routine.  ABF guarantees that this cannot occur in release 6
**	applications by not allowing files to be specified for frames or
**	procedures that share a common file name.
**
** System Status:
**	The called frame will not be run.
**
** User Action:
**	Report this error to your technical representative.
*/

E_WR000F_RETTYPE	"Incompatible return type.\n
The %1c '%0c' returns a value of type '%2c' that is not compatible
with the expected type of '%3c'."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	A return value from a frame or procedure did not agree in type with the
**	expected type.  That is, the type of the return value is not compatible
**	with (coercible to) the expected type declared for the frame or
**	procedure.
**
** System Status:
**	The return value will be undefined.
**
** User Action:
**	Make sure that the type of the value returned agrees with the
**	expected type declared for the frame or procedure.
*/

E_WR0010_ABEXPREVAL	"Error in evaluating an expression.\n
An error occurred when the ABF run-time system tried to evaluate an expression.\ 
Please report this internal problem to your technical support representative."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	The ABF run-time system evaluates all expressions using the internal
**	Abstract Data Facility defined for Ingres.  This facility returned an
**	error for an expression is was to evaluate.  Since, 4GL generates the
**	internal representation for these expressions from the source code,
**	it is likely that it did so incorrectly.
**
** System Status:
**	The result of the expression is undefined.
**
** User Action:
**	Report this error to your technical representative.
*/

E_WR0011_ABNULLNAME	"Null was used where a string is required.\n
A Null value was used where an 4GL name or string value is required."

/*%
** Explanation:
**
** System Status:
**	The 4GL statement containing the NULL value will not be executed.
**
** User Action:
**	Use a string constant or non-NULL field for the expected 4GL name.

E_WR0013_ABNOTFCOL	"Unknown table field column in parameter query.\n
The column '%0c' in the table field '%1c' has been named in the query passed
between frames.  No such table field column exists in the form '%2c' in the

The frame '%0c' was passed a query that references the form '%1c'.  The frame's
form is named '%2c', and that form will be used instead of '%1c'."

E_WR0052	"Cannot create temporary files.\n
Please check your temporary directory access rights and disk space before
reporting this as a problem to your technical support representative."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	The temporary directory cannot have files created within it.  This could
**	be for several reasons, but most likely is because you do not have the
**	required access rights to the temporary directory or because you do not
**	have enough disk space available to create files in that directory.
**
**	The temporary directory is either the current directory or the directory
**	specified by the environment logical II_TEMPORARY.

** System Status:
**	ABF or ABFIMAGE will terminate immediately.
**
** User Action:
**	Make sure that the you have access rights to the temporary directory and
