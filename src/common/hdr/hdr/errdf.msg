E_RD0142_ULH_ACCESS:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS
"consistency check - error from ULH ACCESS command"
/*%
** Parameters:
**	None.
**
** Explanation:
**	RDF has found a synonym and determined what the table ID is for the
**	table that the synonym resolves to.  It is calling ulh_access() to see
**	if the underlying table is already on the cache.  The "not found"
**	error, E_UL0109_NFND, is the only error that is expected here, and that
**	does not cause this error message.  This is an unexpected error.
**
** System Status:
**	The program continues, but the current "CREATE" statement is aborted.
**
** Recommendation:
**	Try stopping the server and restarting it.  There is some sort of
**	cache problem, and restarting the server should clear it.

"RDF interface to QEF (QEU) encountered an error while creating a synonym"

**	QEF does most of the work of adding the synonym to the DBMS catalogs.

**
** System Status:
**	The "CREATE SYNONYM" statement is aborted.

E_RD0145_ALIAS_MEM:SS50003_EXHAUSTED_RESOURCE
"RDF was attempting to define an alias, but ULH returned an error."
/*%
** Parameters:
**	None.
**
** Explanation:
**	RDF did a ulh_define_alias() call, and ULH returned error
**	E_UL0119_ALIAS_MEM.  This is viewed as an error if RDF is attempting
**	to create an alias for a table name.  However, if RDF is attempting to
**	create an alias for a synonym, then this is just a warning.
**
**	In this case, RDF was attempting to create an alias to a table name,
**	so this is an error.  It is probably due to the system not being
**	configured with enough synonym memory space or enough tables in the
**	RDF cache.
**
** System Status:
**	The program continues, and the current statement is aborted.
**
** Recommendation:
**	Use cbf to modify the RDF startup parameters. Specify larger numbers

/*%
** Parameters:
**	None.
**
** Explanation:
**	RDF accepts the startup parameters from config.dat configuration file.
**	One of those parameters, rdf_max_tbls, indicates the maximum number of
**	tables RDF may have on its cache (the default is 300).  Another
**	parameter, tbl_synonyms, indicates how many synonyms may be defined
**	(the default is 1).
**
**	You may have your system configured reasonably, but a lot of concurrent
**	activity is keeping RDF memory usage too high to add another synonym to
**	RDF's memory cache.  Or, your system may not be configured correctly
**	for RDF.
**
**	In either case, you can improve the situation by increasing the
**	number of synonyms permitted, by increasing the values for
**	max_tbls and tbl_synonyms.  The tradeoff is that the DBMS server will
**	use more memory when you increase these values.
**
** System Status:
**	The statement continues running, but will be a bit slower, because the
**	server will have to go to disk next time it needs this information
**	instead of getting it from memory.

** Recommendation:
**	The user may reconfigure RDF startup parameters and restart the server.

** Parameters:

**
** Explanation:
**	The schema named in the "DROP SCHEMA" statement does not exist.

** System Status:
**	The statement is aborted.
**
** Recommendation:
**	Verify that the schema was specified correctly; if not, correct the

"Restricted destruction of a schema could not proceed because the specified

/*%
** Parameters:
**	None.
**
** Explanation:
**	The user issued a "DROP SCHEMA ... RESTRICT", but the named schema
**	still contains tables, views, synonyms, dbevents, or database
**	procedures. For restricted revocation to succeed, the schema must
**	not contain any objects.
**
** System Status:
**	The statement is aborted.
**
** Recommendation:
**	Check the error log for a description of an object still
**	contains in the schema.  To destroy the schema and all the objects
**	therein, specify a "DROP SCHEMA ... CASCADE" statement.
