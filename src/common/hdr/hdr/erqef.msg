"ALTER TABLE DROP CONSTRAINT: 
Constraint '%0c' cannot be dropped because it represents a NOT NULL
constraint that is part of the table structure, and the table structure
cannot be altered."
/*%
** Parameters:
**	%0c - constraint name
**
** Explanation:
**	Normal check constraints are implemented as
**	internal rules on a table.  These rules can be easily
**	dropped when the constraint is dropped.
**	
**	In the ANSI/ISO SQL92 standard, "NOT NULL" is considered
**	to be another form of a CHECK constraint, equivalent to
**	"CHECK (<column> IS NOT NULL)".
**
**	But when the user defines a column as "NOT NULL", this is
**	implemented as a non-nullable datatype, instead of as
**	a rule (as it would for a normal check constraint).  So,
**	since we cannot (in 6.5) alter the datatype of a column,
**	this "NOT NULL" "constraint" cannot be dropped.
**	
**	NOTE: For ANSI compatibility, we create a tuple in the
**	constraints catalog to represent this "NOT NULL" "constraint",
**	so a user can find the name of this "constraint" and try to
**	drop it.
**
** System Status:
**	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.
**
** Recommendation:
**	Do not attempt to drop this constraint.  If you need to insert
**	nulls into a "NOT NULL" column, you must recreate the table with
**	a nullable datatype for that column.

"Query exceeds the limit (%0d) for cascading rules and nested database
procedures.  The query is aborted with a fatal error."
/*%
** Parameters:
**	%0d - maximum nesting level for database procedures
**
** Explanation:
**	This error will occur when executing queries that trigger rule
**	processing. The rule processing may be such that a query triggers
**	a rule, a query within that rule triggers another rule, and so on.
**	Each such nested rule firing causes the execution of the database
**	procedure associated with the rule to be stacked and the database
**	procedure invoked by the newly triggered rule to begin execution.
**	The maximum depth of such nesting is constrained by an internal
**	system parameter. The current query has triggered rule execution
**	that has cascaded beyond the maximum depth allowed.
**
** System Status:
**	The original query triggering rule execution is aborted with a
**	fatal error. All queries run by the database procedures invoked
**	by rule processing are rolled back.
**
** Recommendation:
**	The following are possible causes of this error:
**	    1. The collection of rules defined in the database establishes
**	       dependencies between more tables than are supported by the
**	       system. Both the database design and the set of rules defined
**	       should be inspected and changed to limit the dependencies
**	       between tables.

**	This error will occur when executing queries that trigger rule
