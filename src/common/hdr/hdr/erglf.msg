**    Message file for Facility code: _GL
**
**    History:
**
**	16-feb-1993 (dianeh)
**		Added NO_SQLSTATE_MAPPING to end of file.
**	26-jul-1993 (tyler)
**		Added E_GL6001_PM_OPEN_FAILED message.
**	22-oct-1993 (dianeh)
**		Refine text destined for messages.txt file.
**	07-dec-1993 (tyler)
**		Added loggable STATUS values for PM functions.
**	6-Jan-1994 (daveb)
**	    	Changed typo in PM message number: S...6000 should be E...6000
**	19-jun-1996 (sweeney)
**		Fix a couple of typos.
**	16-oct-96 (mcgem01)
**		MISC_ING_ERRORS changed to MISC_ERRORS for the Jasmine/Ingres
**		identity crisis.
**	22-Nov-00 (loera01) Bug 103318
**		Added E_GL600B_PM_DUP_INIT to SS50000_MISC_ERRORS to give more
**		granuality to duplicate attempts at calling PMinit().
**	09-May-02 (gupsh01) 
**		Added error codes, E_GL7001_E_LC_LOCALE_NOT_FOUND, 
**		E_GL7002_E_LC_CHARSET_NOT_SET and E_GL7003_E_LC_FORMAT_INCORRECT
**		for lc facility.
**	28-May-02 (gupsh01)
**		Modified the error message E_GL7001_E_LC_LOCALE_NOT_FOUND, to 
**		report that we could not find the IANA name for the charset.

E_GL4001_MO_ALREADY_ATTACHED:SS42502_DUPL_OBJECT
"MOattach was given a classid and instance that was already attached."
/*%
** Parameters:
**      None.
**
** Explanation:
**      The internal MOattach() routine detected an attempt to duplicate
**      an MO object that was already attached.  This isn't allowed, and
**      the original object was left intact.  This is a programming error.
**
** System Status:
**      The MO object space may not be the way the programmer intended.
**      Depending on the object, this may or may not affect the system
**      status.
**
** Recommendation:
**      None.
