** Name: SQLSTATE.H - Contains #defines for all ANSI sqlstates
**
** Description:
**      This file contains the #define entries for all user errors
**      known to Ingres.  All are constructed by "oring" the
**      E_US_MASK mask with the error number in question.
**
**      Note that although users are used to seeing errors in
**      decimal, we still construct the error numbers in hex
**      so that they satisfy all the silly compilers on which
**      we have to run.
**
** History:
**	21-sep-92 (andre)
**	    updated descriptions/numbers of the SQLSTATEs from the SQL92 +
**	    defined constants (base 36; 0=0, ... 9=9, A=10, ... Z=35) to
**	    correspond to classes and subclasses
**	08-oct-93 (rblumer)
**	    added subclasses for each of the 4 types of REFERENTIAL constraint
**	    violations; while I was at it, also added subclasses for CHECK and
**	    UNIQUE constraints.  See subclasses 23500-23505.
**	10-mar-94 (andre)
**	    defined SS5000N_OPERAND_TYPE_MISMATCH, 
**	    SS5000O_INVALID_FUNC_ARG_TYPE, SS5000P_TIMEOUT_ON_LOCK_REQUEST, 
**	    SS5000Q_DB_REORG_INVALIDATED_QP, and SS5000R_RUN_TIME_LOGICAL_ERROR
**	15-mar-94 (andre)
**	    removed definitions of 37000- and 2A000-series SQLSTATEs as they are
**	    being removed from SQL92.
**	10-oct-1996 (canor01)
**	    Change SS50000_MISC_ING_ERRORS to SS50000_MISC_ERRORS.
**	20-oct-98 (inkdo01)
**	    Added SS23001_REF_RESTRICT_VIOLATION for ref constraint violation
**	    on delete/update of referenced table with RESTRICT action.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	18-mar-02 (inkdo01)
**	    Added SS2200H_SEQ_EXCEEDED for next value for sequence overflow.

/*
** Terminology:
**
**    <extended statement/cursor name> -
**      extended name consists of keyword GLOBAL or LOCAL followed by <parameter
**      name> or <embedded variable name>.  Scope of GLOBAL <extended statement
**      name> or <extended cursor name> is SQL-session whereas scope of LOCAL
**      <extended statement name> or <extended cursor name> is the <module> in
**      which it appears.
**
**      One may prepare a <cursor specification> giving it <extended statement
**      name> in which case one may be able to declare a dynamic extended cursor
**      by using <allocate cursor statement>.
**
**    <row subquery> -
**      specifies a row derived from a <query expression>;
**      must have degree > 1 and cardinality <= 1
**
**    <scalar subquery> -
**      specifies a scalar value derived from a <query expression>;
**      must have degree == 1 and cardinality <= 1
**
**    SQL-agent -
**      an implementation-dependent entity that causes the execution of
**      SQL-statements
**
**    procedure -
**      SQL92 defines a procedure as consisting of a <procedure name>, a
**      sequence of <parameter declaration>s, and a single <SQL procedure
**      statement>; SQL92 defines a mechanism for deriving from an ESQL program
**      of a host language program and a MODULE consisting of procedures and
**      declarations - thus references to procedures should be understood to
**      mean references to ESQL statements which were a part of ESQL program
**
**    character repertoire -
**      a set of characters used for a specific purpose or application

**      SQL-session associated with SQL-agent
**
** Generic Error Mapping:
**    Ingres behavior is at odds with the standard on two counts:
**    (1) In some cases, Ingres does not detect connection errors
**        when the connection statement is executed.  For example, switching 
**        to an invalid or 'dead' connection via set_sql doesn't yield 
**        an error (E_GE9088_COMM_ERROR) until the first database statement 
**        is issued.
**    (2) Ingres doesn't support a DEFAULT connection.  However, if
**        an application issues database SQL without an established 
**        connection Ingres reports a E_GE9088_COMM_ERROR.
**    The one case which does map well occurs when a DISCONNECT of a 
**    non-existent session is issued.  A Generic Error of E_GE80E8_LOGICAL_ERROR
**    is returned.  This value will be used for mapping purposes.
**
** NOTE:
**    Connection errors have undergone significant change in SQL92 since
**    the March, 1992 draft.  We will need to update the '08xxx' section
**    accordingly.
