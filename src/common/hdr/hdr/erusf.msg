** Explanation:
**	NOTE: errors 2003 and 2004 show syntax for 6.4 and before.
**	      See new syntax errors 4112 and 4113 for post-6.4 versions.
**	
**	The accepted syntax diagram for the column qualifier clause is:

**	'[[not null [with | not default]] | with null]
**		[not | with system_maintained]'
**
**	with one exception. It is not allowed to specify either "not default"
**	or "with null" in conjunction with the "with system_maintained" 
**	qualifier.
**
**	The order of these qualifiers is significant, and must appear as
**	described.  The following is a complete list of accepted attribute
**	qualifiers (a few options, although syntactically correct per the 
**	above diagrams, are disallowed due to the "with system_maintained"
**	restrictions):
**
**		with null
**		not null with default
**		not null not default
**		not null with default with system_maintained
**		with null not system_maintained
**		not null with default not system_maintained
**		not null not default not system_maintained
**		with system_maintained
**		not system_maintained

**	
**	The accepted syntax diagram for the column qualifier clause is:

**	      [UNIQUE | PRIMARY KEY] [REFERENCES <table>(<col_list>)]

**	The order of these qualifiers is no longer significant (as of 6.5).
**	The following is a complete list of accepted attribute qualifiers
**	(a few options, although syntactically correct per the above syntax
**	diagram, are disallowed due to the "with system_maintained"
**	restrictions): 
**	
**	        with null

**	        not  null with default
**	        not  null [with] default <value>
**	        not  null not default
