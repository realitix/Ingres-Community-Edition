**  Name: ADP.H - ADF Peripheral datatype structure definitions
**
**  Description:
**      This file contains the C types and define's necessary for ADF's
**	manipulations of peripheral types.
**
**  History:
**      23-Jan-1990 (fred)
**          Created.
**      23-Mar-1993 (fred)
**          Removed DB_TAB_ID reference from ADP_POP_CB to support
**          splitting of <dbms.h>.  Field was set only -- never used.
**       6-Jul-1993 (fred)
**          Added func extern/prototype for adu_peripheral -- the
**          fexi-based function called by users to do peripheral
**          manipulation. 
**      12-Aug-1993 (fred)
**          Added prototype for adu_lo_delete() -- to delete LO temp's.
**      15-Apr-1994 (fred)
**          Altered prototype for adu_free_objects.  Now takes a
**          sequence number as well.
**	28-mar-1996 (toumi01)
**	    Increased size of ADP_COUPON from 20 bytes to 24 bytes for
**	    axp_osf to allow for 8-byte pointer.  Added dummy ALIGN_RESTRICT
**	    "Align" variable to ADP_PERIPHERAL union to force alignment
**	    to accommodate pointer in coupon.
**	31-jul-1996 (kch)
**	    Replaced ADP_FREE_OBJECTS (remove temp objects) with
**	    ADP_FREE_NONSESS_OBJS (remove all non sess temp objects) and
**	    ADF_FREE_ALL_OBJS (remove all temp objects, including sess temps
**	    objects). This change fixes bug 78030.
**      08-aug-1996 (i4jo01)
**          Add define for ADP_CLOSE_TABLE to allow varchar function to close
**          the extension table it happens to be using. This was done to fix
**          bug #77189.
**	24-Mar-1998 (thaju02)
**	    Bug #87880 - Added ADP_POP_FROM_COPY.
**	14-nov-1998 (somsa01)
**	    In ADP_POP_CB, added pop_xcb_ptr to hold the xcb pointer.
**	    (Bug #79203)
**	07-dec-1998 (somsa01)
**	    Re-worked the fix for bug #79203. The previous fix compromised
**	    spatial objects (unless a change was made to iiadd.h, which we
**	    are hesitant to make).  (Bug #79203)
**	10-may-99 (stephenb)
**	    Add define for ADP_CLEANUP
**      23-mar-1999 (hweho01)
**          Extended the changes for axp_osf to ris_u64 (AIX 64-bit platform).
**	16-apr-1999 (hanch04)
**	    For LP64 add cpn_id[5] to debugging prints for expanded
**	    64-bit coupon.
**      08-Sep-2000 (hanje04)
**          Extended the changes for axp_osf to axp_lnx (Alpha Linux)
**      12-jun-2001 (stial01)
**          Added ADW_L_BYTES, ADW_L_CPNBYTES
**      20-mar-2002 (stial01)
**          ADP_COUPON is 6 words only when there is no 32 - 64 bit upgrade 
**          path.
**	24-Oct-2001 (thaju02)
**	    Added shd_exp_action of ADW_FLSH_SEG_NOFIT_LIND to signify
**	    that we must flush segment due to adc_lvch_xform() being unable
**	    to fit 2 byte segment length indicator into result buffer.
**	    (B104122) 
**	10-sep-2002 (somsa01)
**	    Going along with Alison's change, "Align" should only be used
**	    only when there is no 32-64 bit upgrade path.
**      02-oct-2002 (stial01)
**          Added ADW_FLUSH_INCOMPLETE_SEGMENT for DB_LNVCHR_TYPE's
**          We may need to flush output buffer before it is full.
**	02-oct-2003 (somsa01)
**	    Ported to NT_AMD64.
**	16-oct-2003 (stial01, gupsh01)
**	    Added ADW_HALF_DBL_FLOC for indicating half of 
**	    unicode value is stored in adc_chars. 1/2 of unicode 
**	    is stored in adc_chars if a unicode value splits up in 
**	    input buffers.
**      12-Apr-2004 (stial01)
**          Define length as SIZE_TYPE.
**	7-May-2004 (schka24)
**	    Get rid of CLOSE TABLE, superseded by CLEANUP.
**	    Simplify all the crazy short temp/long temp stuff.
**      11-Aug-2006 (stial01)
**          Added new routines for substring, position for blobs.
**      16-oct-2006 (stial01)
**          Changes for blob locators.
**      08-dec-2006 (stial01)
**          Added additional position functions.
**      09-feb-2007 (stial01)
**          Added ADP_FREE_LOCATOR, adu_free_locator()
**      17-may-2007 (stial01)
**          Changed prototype for adu_free_locator
**	21-Mar-2009 (kiria01) SIR121788
**	    Added prototype for extended adu_lo_setup_workspace and
**	    adu_long_coerce
**	05-May-2009 (kiria01) b122030
**	    Added prototype for adu_long_unorm
**	13-Oct-2010 (thaju02) B124469
**	    Added prototype for adu_19lvch_chrlen.
**	31-Jan-2011 (drivi01)
**	    Take out a64_win from ADP_PERIPHERAL and ADP_COUPON
**	    structures to prevent different size structure
**	    on 32-bit and 64-bit windows, to make it possible
**	    to upgrade from 32-bit build of Ingres to 64-bit.

** Name: ADP_COUPON - Coupon for later exchange for a peripheral type.
**
** Description:
**      This structure is used by the system for the storage of peripheral
**	types.  Peripheral types are not stored, by the DBMS, inline with the
**	tuple.  Instead, this coupon is stored.  Later, when the actual data for
**	the peripheral type is desired, this coupon may be `redeemed' for the
**	actual data.
**	
**      The data in the coupon is really not controlled by ADF, however, ADF
**	must understand its format.  Therefore, there is some cooperation in
**	design between the tuple storer (DMF in the DBMS case) and ADF.
**
**      DMF will use the fields contained herein to store the peripheral
**	location of the data represented by this coupon.  This will be used
**	later, by DMF, to materialize the actual data.

** Name: ADP_POP_CB - CB used to invoke peripheral operations (POP's)
**
** Description:
**      This control block is used for ADF to invoke the peripheral operations
**	necessary to allow ADF to manipulate peripheral datatypes.  Internally,
**	ADF divides peripheral datatypes into smaller units of some
**	non-peripheral datatype.  By so doing, the DBMS can store the segments
**	as tuples in non-peripheral tables (table extensions in DMF
**	terminology).
**
**	This control block is used to invoke the necessary operations of get,
**	put, and delete.  All of these operations involve the use of a coupon,
**	as described above.  All but delete are transfering data from or to a
**	segment.  Thus, this control block, in addition to the standard headers
**	necessary in the DBMS, defines the two data elements as a segment and a
**	coupon.  Other administrative information is present to describe in more
**	detail the operation being performed.  The operation codes which are
**	described by this CB are described above.
**
**	ADF internally expects to call a routine whose standard interface is
**	
**	    status = (*routine)(i4 operation, ADP_POP_CB* pop_cb);
**
**	where status is one of
**	
**		ADP_INFORMATION	    Obtain information about
**				    runtime environment.
**
**		ADP_GET		    Get the next segment
**
**		ADP_PUT		    Put the next segment
**
**		ADP_DELETE	    Delete an entire peripheral object.
**
**		ADP_COPY	    Copy a coupon from one
**				    place to another
**
** History:
**      23-Jan-1990 (fred)
**          Created.
**      23-Mar-1993 (fred)
**          Removed DB_TAB_ID reference from ADP_POP_CB to support
**          splitting of <dbms.h>.  Field was set only -- never used.
**      27-Oct-1993 (fred)
**          Added pop_segno{0,1}.  These are used to request an
**          ADP_GET operation on a specific segment.  They are valid
**          only during an ADP_GET operation.  To have an effect,
**          these must be accompanied by setting the ADP_C_RANDOM_MASK
**          in the continuation field.
**	05-nov-1993 (smc)
**          Bug #58635
**          Made l_reserved & owner elements PTR for consistency with
**	    DM0M_OBJECT.
**          In this instance owner was missing from the 'standard header'.
**	24-Mar-1998 (thaju02)
**	    Bug #87880 - Added ADP_POP_FROM_COPY.
**      29-Jun-98 (thaju02)
**          Added #define for ADP_GLBL_SESS_TEMP_ETAB. (B91469)
**	14-nov-1998 (somsa01)
**	    Added pop_xcb_ptr to hold the xcb pointer.  (Bug #79203)
**	07-dec-1998 (somsa01)
**	    Re-worked the fix for bug #79203. The previous fix compromised
**	    spatial objects (unless a change was made to iiadd.h, which we
**	    are hesitant to make).  (Bug #79203)
**	10-jan-99 (stephenb)
**	    Add pop_info field to avoid the use of temp tables.
**	11-May-2004 (schka24)
**	    Simplify temp flags.
**	26-Feb-2010 (troal01)
**	    Add ADP_C_GET_MASK to ensure that cpn_tcb isn't filled with a
**	    bogus value in dmpe_allocate, this flag is very short-lived:
**	    it is set before dmpe_allocate is called in dmpe_get and is removed

**	16-Oct-2003 (stial01, gupsh01)
**	    Added ADW_C_HALF_DBL_FLOC to indicate if half
**	    a unicode/dbl byte value is set in the DBL flag 
**	    as first half of a two byte unicode value can be 0. 
**       7-Oct-2005 (hanal04) Bug 113093 INGSRV2973
**          Added ADW_S_BYTES. In SPuslong_xform() we may copy part of a

**          to know how many whole points have been transfered and
**          the ADW_S_BYTES short is used to ensure the subsequent call
**          includes the partial (I)POINT's bytes in the amount transferred.
**	24-May-2007 (gupsh01)
**	    Added HALF_DBL_MAXCNT for storing count of the partial multibyte

** Name: ADP_LO_WKSP - Workspace for longish peripheral operations
**
** Description:
**      This data structure is used by peripheral operations to maintain
**	their context across calls.  Since peripheral datatypes tend to be
**	larger than is convenient to store in memory, it is often the case
**	that many passes are required for them to complete.  That is,
**	they will often return before their operation is complete, requesting
**	that their caller obtain more data or buffer space in which they can
**	work.
**
**	Given that this is the case and that there may be more than one
**	peripheral operation going on at once,  these routines require that a
**	workspace be provided.  The definition of the fields in this workspace
**	is public -- it must be since the caller must declare and own this
**	space;  the routine being called may specify a public usage for some or
**	all of these fields.  However, unless the called routine specifies that
**	the field may be altered, the caller is expected to preserve the value
**	of all fields across calls.

**      15-may-1990 (fred)
**          Created.
**  	24-Nov-1992 (fred)
**          Redone.  Separated sections by interface function.  Added

** Name: ADP_FILTER_FCN -- Function used by large object filter instances
**
** Description:
**      This is a datatype which defines the prototype used for
**      large object filtered instance functions.  These are functions
**      which are implemented using the general purpose
**      adu_lo_filter_fcn() routine which will apply some slave
**      function (specifically of the type specified by this typdef)
**      to each segment in the large object.  These instances are, in
**      general, relatively easy to generate, since they typically use
**      existing instances for the base type of the large object
**      applied to each segment.  They use the ADP_LO_WKSP workspace
**      (defined above) to maintain context between the master routine
**      and the individual invocations of the slave routine.
**
**      For more details, see the adu_lo_filter() routine definition.
