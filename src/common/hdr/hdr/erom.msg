E_OM0001_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL	"Error buffer too small.\n
The error buffer is too small to hold the error given.  This is an
internal error and should be reported to your INGRES technical support
representative."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	A  buffer passed to an error processing routine was too small for
**	the error being returned.  Normally, this error is not shown to
**	the user.  If it is, then there is an error in the INGRES code
**	that needs to be reported.
**
** System Status:
**	The continuation of the application is uncertain at this point.
**	Different applications will deal with it differently.
**
** User Action:
**	Report this to you INGRES technical representative.
