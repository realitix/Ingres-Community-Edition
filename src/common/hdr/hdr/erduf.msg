** Parameters:
**	%0c - location logical name (from iilocations.lname)
**	%1c - physical translation of logical location name
**		(from iilocations.area)
**
** Explanation:
**	Table iilocation keeps a list of location names and what
**	these names translate to.  The user never refers to the translated
**	name, they always use the logical name to refer to a location. accessdb
**	is the only utility that permits a user to associate logical and
**	physical names.  accessdb puts the logical/physical pair into the
**	config file when a database is extended to a specific location.  It
**	uses the iilocations tuple to get logical/physical values for this
**	location.
**
**	In this case, the logical name has been corrupted to the point that
**	the DBMS cannot use it to look up the physical area associated with the
**	logical.
**
**	verifydb will automatically remove the tuple from iilocations, unless
**	it is being run in RUNINTERACTIVE mode.  It will print the physical
**	name (or area) associated with the logical in the verifydb log.  The

**	After the corrective action is taken, the user should use accessdb to
**	redefine the location.  NOTE: Because the location information is in
**	the config file, the user must use the same logical/physical
**	names that the location was previously defined at.  If the user
**	does not know how the location should be defined, they should do
**	an ASCII dump on the config file to find out.  The config file resides
**	in the database's default data location and is file aaaaaaaa.cnf.

S_DU17FE_FORCE_CONSISTENT_WARN
"WARNING:\n\n
  VERIFYDB operation FORCE_CONSISTENT makes the database appear consistent to\n
  the DBMS but does not repair whatever caused the inconsistency to occur.\n
  The ONLY supported way to recover your database is to rollforward from a\n

  FORCE_CONSISTENT will make it possible for you to access the database and\n
  attempt to examine and fix the tables. 
  Check the iircp.log to determine why the database was marked inconsistent.\n
  Loss of data may have occurred if the database was marked inconsistent by\n
  the recovery server because of failure during online/offline recovery.\n
  Use logdump to display log records written since the last consistency point.\n

  There is an increased risk to data integrity if you continue using a\n 
  database that has been forced consistent.\n"
/*%
** Parameters:
**	None.
**
** Explanation:
**	The message is a legal disclaimer that the DBMS server cannot ensure

**	this database after forcing it consistent, it is possible that the new
**	work done may be lost at some future date.
**
** System Status:
**	This is a warning message, not an error.  Unless the user specifies
**	that they want to stop the process, verifydb keeps processing.
**
** Recommendation:
**	If the user has not selected RUNINTERACTIVE mode, verifydb will just
**	print the warning message and continue its processing.  If the user
**	has specified the RUNINTERACTIVE mode, then the user must answer a
**	prompt asking whether or not they really want to run verifydb.
**
**	If the user has journaling enabled, they may prefer to roll back to
**	the last checkpoint and then use journaling to recapture the work
**	they have done since that checkpoint.  If they do not have journaling
**	enabled, then they probably do want to force the database consistent.
**
**	However, once the database has been forced consistent, it should not
**	be used as though it had never been marked inconsistent.  The
**	user is expected to use unloaddb to get their data out of this
**	database.  They are expected to destroy this database and recreate it,
**	then run the reload.ing script that unloaddb creates.  If they keep
**	using the database they have forced consistent, they may run into

**	Some utilities (createdb, upgradedb) need to spawn upgradefe while
**	connected to a Star server if they are attempting to operate (i.e.,
**	create or upgrade) a distributed database.  They do some work via the
**	local server, disconnect from it, then connect to the Star server and
**	spawn upgradefe.  After upgradefe completes, the utility attempts to
**	disconnect from the Star server and reconnect to the local server.  In
**	this instance, the upgradedb utility should have been connected to the
**	coordinator database via a local server and was not.
**
** System Status:
**	Execution stops.
**
** Recommendation:
**	The user should verify that the local and Star servers are up and
**	operative in their installation.  The user should verify that there
**	are no other installation problems that can make it impossible to
**	connect and do commits via these servers, then re-issue the upgradedb
**	command.

/*%
** Parameters:
**	%0c - database name

**
** Explanation:
**	If the 5.0 dbdb is converted to iidbdb or if "finddbs -r" is run
**	in an installation that contains both 5.0 and 6.x databases, there
**	will be entries for 5.0 databases in the iidatabase catalog.  These

**	destroydb will destroy databases if it can find entries for them in

**	This means that it would be possible to destroy 5.0 databases from

**	database exists, but the directories would be missing.  Therefore,
**	destroydb refuses to destroy databases that are marked as DU_CONVERTING,

**
** System Status:
**	destroydb prints a warning and refuses to destroy the database. This
**	message is presented when the "-p" flag is not specified.
**
** Recommendation:
**	If this is a healthy 5.0 database, the user has two choices:
**
**	  1.  use 5.0 destroydb
**	  2.  do not destroy the database

**	If this is the obscure case of a conversion that failed and the

"VERIFYDB:  FATAL ERROR.\n
Unable to create temp table in name-range of\n
'%0c to '%1c'"
/*%
** Parameters:
**	%0c - lowest temp table name
**	%1c - max temp table name
**
** Explanation:
**	verifydb must create a temporary table (owned by $ingres).  The name
**	of that table must fall between the lower and upper table names --
**	verifydb uses a lookup table of possible names.  In this case, the
**	database already had tables owned by $ingres with all of the names that
**	verifydb has in its lookup table.
**
** System Status:
**	This is a fatal error -- verifydb processing stops.
**
** Recommendation:
**	The user must free up one of these table names.  If these are temp
**	tables, then delete them.  If not, copy one table to something else,
**	drop that table, run verifydb, recreate the table, and copy the data
**	back.

"ERROR encountered while attempting TABLE or XTABLE operation on table\n

/*%
** Parameters:
**	%0c - table name
**	%1c - database name
**
** Explanation:
**	An error was encountered while attempting the table or xtable
**	operation.  That error is reported in the verifydb log.
**
** System Status:
**	The verifydb process stops; the transaction is aborted. But any
**	changes to the disk file may or may not be flushed to disk, depending
**	on DMF's state when the error was encountered.
**
** Recommendation:
**	The user should refer to the verifydb log file to see what went wrong.
**	The user may be required to take some corrective action, based on the
**	nature of the error.  Certain errors are forever fatal -- such as
**	DMF not being able to open the file.  Other errors may be transient,

E_DU502F_CANT_PATCH_SCONDUR
"It is illegal to patch a DBMS Core Catalog."
/*%
** Parameters:
**	None.
**
** Explanation:
**	S_CONCUR (or DBMS core catalogs) must be a hash.  DMF assumes the
**	format of the file.  It is illegal to modify the file to any other
**	storage format.  Since patch always modifies a table to heap, it
**	is not reasonable to patch a core catalog.
**
** System Status:

** Recommendation:
**	The user should use normal methods to get healthy core catalogs;

E_DU5030_CANT_PATCH_INDEX
"It is illegal to patch a secondary index."
/*%
** Parameters:
**	None.
**
** Explanation:
**	The patch operation may cause individual tuples or groups of tuples
**	to be dropped.  It is not reasonable to drop some tuples from a
**	secondary index, because corresponding tuples will not be dropped
**	from the base table.  Then we will hit a condition where the base
**	table and secondary index are out of sync with each other.

**
** Explanation:
**	The user running verifydb does not have superuser privilege

**	None.
**
** Explanation:
**	This syntax error occurred during PURGE_EXPIRED processing.  It is

E_DU6005_NONEXISTENT_IIDBDB
"Database 'iidbdb' does not exist.\n
UPGRADEDB is terminating.\n"
/*%
** Parameters:
**	None.
**
** Explanation:
**	Upgradedb is a frontend.  No frontend may run on an installation that
**	does not have an iidbdb.  Actually, there should not be any databases
**	in an installation that does not have an iidbdb, since createdb is also
**	a frontend and also cannot create any user databases until the iidbdb is
**	first created.  It does not make sense to be using upgradedb if you do
**	not have databases to upgrade, so let us assume that you have an
**	installation problem.  Common things that will make it impossible for
**	the system to find the iidbdb include: 1) the II_DATABASE symbol is
**	not correctly defined (concealed device on VMS); 2) the II_DATABASE
**	symbol does not point to the correct location; 3) someone has
**	removed the config file (aaaaaaaa.cnf) from the iidbdb's default
**	data location, or the disk device that contains the iidbdb is off-line;
**	or, 4) II_DBMS_SERVER is defined to point to a non-existent server.
**
**	Another possibility is that you are a release 5 user that is attempting
**	to upgrade to release 6 and you are inadvertently using the wrong tool.
**	Use convto60 to go from release 5 to release 6; upgradedb is only
**	used to go from one version of release 6 to another.  If you are 
**	converting from release 5, you must convert the dbdb to iidbdb before
**	you do anything else.  The command is:
**
**	  # convto60 -mcontinue -sdbname dbdb
**
** System Status:
**	  The upgradedb process stops.
**
** Recommendation:
**	  You must fix the installation problem (see explanation) and then
**	  verify that you can connect to the iidbdb via TM.  After that is
**	  successful, re-issue the upgradedb command.

**	In this case, you must destroy the iidbdb by deleting the files in its
**	default data directory and then bring down the DBMS server (to clear
**	cached info about the iidbdb), restart the server, then create iidbdb,
**	using: "createdb -S iidbdb".
**
**	If you already have an installation with other databases in it, attempt
**	the upgradedb of the iidbdb again.  If that fails check the upgradedb
**	log and the error log.  If neither log gives you a clear picture of the
**	problem, call Actian Corporation Technical Support.
**
** System Status:
**	  The upgradedb process stops.
**
** Recommendation:
**	  You must determine why the iidbdb is inoperative and correct the
