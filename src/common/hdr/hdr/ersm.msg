** History:
**	13-sep-1989 (Joe)
**	    First written
**	6-may-1991 (jab)
**	    Added a sentence that makes errors 000A and 000D 
**          a little less frightening, since they come up during normal
**          'importing' of an application.
** 13-0ct-92 (elein)
**     Added 'report' as an object type
** 26-oct-92 (pete)
**	Added F_SY000C_SCRIPTSRC for use in symscrip.c.
** 05-oct-95 (lan) Bug 70520
**	Fix grammar error in message E_SY0007_BADNAMESTART.
** 26-jan-1999 (donc) Bug 95016
**      Make the E_SY000C message more informative if in the context
**	of a External Class Library.
** 04-Aug-2000 (yeema01) Bug 102264
**      Changed the SY message class to SM to avoid conflict with Rosetta.

E_SM0000_BADARRTYPE	"The type for an array's rows is invalid\n
The type for an array's row must be class.  An array is trying to be
created whose row's type is not a class.  This is invalid."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	Arrays in Sapphire can only contain rows whose elements are
**	reference variable.  This means the type of the row must be
**	a class.  An attempt has been made to build an array whose
**	row's type is not a class and this is illegal.
**
** System Status
**	The system behavior depends on the context this is done in.
**	If 4GL code, a compile time error will be generated.  In
**	the user interface, a specific error will be generated.
**
** User Action:
**	Declare the array so that its row type is a class.
*/

E_SM0001_TYPETOOLONG	"Type unknown or typename too long\n
The name given for a datatype is not a known class name, and is too
long to be the name of a simple type."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	The string the user gave for a datatype was too long to
**	be a valid scalar datatype, and the name was not found
**	to be a class name.  This means the type is invalid.
**
** System Status
**	The system behavior depends on the context this is done in.
**	If 4GL code, a compile time error will be generated.  In
**	the user interface, a specific error will be generated.
**
** User Action:
**	Use a valid type name.

only have the System default or NULL.  Please change the setting of the
DefaultValue."

/*%
** Parameters:

**
** Explanation:
**	The setting of DefaultValue for a variable is illegal for a reference

E_SM000C_NAMENOTTYPE	"Name given as type is not a TYPE.\n
The name '%0c' was used in a declaration as a type name.  However the
component with the name '%0c' is a '%1c', so it can't be used in a type
declaration.  If the name given corresponds to an element of an
External Class Library, you should prepend the name with the External Class
Library name followed by the '!' operator"

**
** Explanation:
**	A name that was used in a declaration (e.g. var = type_name) was
