/**
** Name:    erw4.msg -	4GL Translator Message Definitions File.
**
** Description:
**	Contains the definitions for messages and error messages for
**	the 4GL translators.
**
** History:
**	Revision 6.0  87/08/03  wong
**	Initial revision.
**	10-feb-89 (marian)
**		Added E_W40224 for conversion warning messages.
**
**	W4GL I
**	25-jul-1990 (Joe)
**	    Added errors for incorrect type of field for the data
**	    it is attached to.
**
**	W4GL II
**	30-apr-1991 (sandyd)
**	     Changed W4_CLASS from 53 to 211 to avoid collision with old ABF.
**	11/20/91 (dkh) - ER changes for internationalization.
**	01/09/92 (emerson)
**		Changed messages S_W40263 and S_W40264 (which were created by
**		the previous change) and added S_W402B3 and S_W402B4,
**		so that line number and script name can be extracted from them.
**		(This facilitates invoking an editor on the appropriate
**		script source file).
**	03/03/92 (emerson)
**		Refined message S_W40289_UNDEF_PROC_IN_EXP.
**		(Part of fix for bug 42411).
**	04/13/92 (emerson)
**		Replaced message S_W4029E_SINGLE_EXP with a less obscure message
**		(Part of fix for bug 43046).
**
**	W4GL II FCS
**	07/27/92 (emerson)
**		Added message E_W4010D_STACK_OVERFLOW (for bug 43951).
**		Also added E_W400F0, S_W400F1, S_W400F2, and E_W400F3
**		(to remove redundant info from syntax error messages).
**
**		Also made several changes to messages S_W40255 - S_W402B2:
**		In W4GL II beta, the texts of these messages were used as
**		formats in calls to STprintf; the resulting string was printed
**		with a message ID of E_W4000A_TESTERROR.  In W4GL II FCS,
**		I print these messages with unique IDs; I skip the STprintf and
**		use the unique ID as input to e.g. IIUGfer.  This involved the
**		following changes to each of the messages S_W40255 - S_W402B2:
**		(1) If the message text contained no '%', I simply changed
**		    the leading S in the message ID to E.
**		(2) If the message text contained a '%', I created a new
**		    E_W4nnnn message ID, whose text is similar to the original
**		    S_W4mmmm message text, but with '%0c' or '%1c' in place of
**		    '%s', '%0x' or '%1x' in place of '%x', and so forth.
**		    The old S_W4mmmm message is retained in support of old
**		    executables.
**
**		Also clarified E_W40271_CANT_ASSIGN_PROC_OBJ (bug 44327).
**
**	W4GL III
**	5-feb-1993 (emerson)
**		Added E_W402C5 - E_W402CC and modified E_W40024, E_W40026,
**		and E_W40027 for local procedures.
**		Changed "debugger expression" to "dynamic expression"
**		in E_W402B5 and E_W402B6.
**	3-may-1993 (emerson)
**		For repeating fields: added E_W402D4 and E_W402D5,
**		and modified the wording of several messages that used
**		to talk only about table fields.
**		Also corrected the wording of E_W40277.
**	5-may-1993 (emerson)
**		Further refinement to E_W40277.
**	22-jun-1993 (emerson)
**		Modified E_W4026F, E_W40278, and E_W402D5
**		to reflect changes in syntax for referring to
**		the layout copy of a repeating field.
**	28-jul-1993 (emerson)
**		Added E_W402E1 and E_W402E2 for dynamic field declarations.
**	28-dec-1993 (emerson)
**		Added E_W402E3_TOO_MANY_PARMS.
**	13-mar-1994 (emerson)
**		Added E_W402E4 - E_W402EF.
**	17-mar-1994 (blaise)
**		Added S_W40267_IN_INCLUDE.
**	26-oct-1995 (connie) Bug #70175
**		Added E_W402F0_LENGTH_DECL_EXPECTED.
**	21-mar-96 (rogerwh)
**		Added E_W402F1_CASE_TYPECHK, E_W402F2_DUPLICATE_DEFAULT,
**		E_W402F3_DUPLICATE_CASE_VALUE errors for the case statement.
**	26-apr-1996 (rogerwh)
**		Added explanations to these messages.
**	12-dec-2002 (zhayu01) SIR 111125
**		Added nchar and nvarchar to E_W402F0_LENGTH_DECL_EXPECTED and
**		E_W402F5_NCHAR_LITERALS.
**	21-jul-2005 (malsa02) bug 114900
**		Added E_W402F5
**	25-aug-2005 (crido01)
**		Changed the last E_W402F5 to E_W402F6
**	18-aug-2011 (crido01) Bug 125670
**	    Modify message for E_W40026, it now takes two
**	    parameters; the dataytpe and the variable name

/*%
** Explanation:
**	4GL could not open the specified file to write a program listing for
**	the source file being compiled.  This could be for any number of
**	reasons, but most likely is because you do not have access rights to

**
** System Status:

**	of the source file was a comment.  Since no more lines can be compiled,
**	the compilation will be terminated with an error status.

**	Insert the comment termination sequence "* /" (note:  no space) at the
**	appropriate place after the comment that caused the error.  Then compile
**	the source file.

E_W40032	"Unterminated string constant (strings cannot span lines.)"

/*%
** Explanation:
**	You probably forgot to terminate the string with a string delimiter
**	character.  Strings cannot contain embedded new-lines.  The string on
**	this line must be terminated with a string delimiter character also on
**	this line.
**
** System Status:
**	The string will be terminated at the new-line and parsing will continue.
**	This may inadvertently result in spurious errors being recognized.  The
**	source file will not be compiled.
**
** User Action:
**	Terminate the string with a string delimiter character.  Or, if you
**	want a new-line to be embedded in the string, use text notation ('\n')
**	in 4GL/QUEL, or use hexadecimal specification (X'0C', ASCII) in 4GL/SQL.

** Explanation:

**	Notes to translators:
**
**	Messages S_W40263, S_W40264, S_W402B3, and S_W402B4 are used in very
**	specific ways, which must be borne in mind when translating them:
**	(1) The first substitution parameter in S_W40263_ERROR_AT_LINE is %s;
**	    its value indicates the severity of the error.
**	    This value will always be S_W402B3_ERROR or S_W402B4_WARNING;
**	    S_W402B3_ERROR and S_W402B4_WARNING are used nowhere else.
**	(2) The second substitution parameter in S_W40263_ERROR_AT_LINE is %ld;
**	    its value indicates the number of the line containing the error.
**	(3) S_W40264_IN_SCRIPT will appear immediately after
**	    S_W40263_ERROR_AT_LINE (on the same line) *if* the error or warning
**	    is in a widget script (as opposed to a frame or procedure script);
**	    S_W40264_IN_SCRIPT is used nowhere else.
**	    The two substitution parameters in S_W40264_IN_SCRIPT are each %s;
**	    their values indicate the type and name of the widget, in that order
**	(4) W4GL contains logic that parses the "stuff" that's generated
**	    in the listing file from these messages.  (The purpose of this
**	    logic is to bring up an editor on the script that contains a line
**	    on which the compiler reported an error).  This logic assumes that
**	    this "stuff" is all on one line.  Therefore, no translation
**	    may contain a new-line ('\n') in any of these messages.
**	(5) S_W40267_IN_INCLUDE will appear immediately after
**	    S_W40263_ERROR_AT_LINE (on the same line) *if* the error or warning
**	    is in an #include script. The substitution parameter is the name
