/*%
** Parameters:
**    0    first 64 characters of path name passed to opendir().
**
** Explanation:
**	
**	A session encountered an error while calling the system
**	dependent interface to open a directory.   This call is
**	used to check the existence of a directory and to list
**	contents of the directory.  Usual errors are that the given
**	directory does not exist, or that for some reason permissions
**	on the directory or the path to the directory deny access for
**	the program attempting to access the directory.

user id be able to access the given file locations)."
/*%
** Parameters:
**	None.
**
** Explanation:
**	The server was attempting to fork slave processes to perform I/O
**	processing, but failed. The failure may have been due to system resource
**	shortage, or to a configuration problem. Verify that the system
**	has sufficient resources (swap space, process slots, semaphores, etc.)
**	to fork the slave processes. Check the shared memory, using
**	csreport. Check II_NUM_SLAVES to see how many slaves were being forked.
**
** System Status:
**	The server will fail to start.
**
** Recommendation:
**	Correct the configuration problem or resource shortage and restart the
**	server.

/*%
** Parameters:
**	None.
**
** Explanation:
**	When the Recovery Process (dmfrcp) is first started, it opens
**	the log file and performs any recovery actions needed.
**
**	The first step in this process is to verify that the log file
**	has been initialized by the current version of the DBMS software.
**
**	A version number is recorded in the log file header; this version
**	number must match the version number compiled into the dmfrcp process.
**	If the version numbers do not match, the dmfrcp process refuses to
**	start.
**
** System Status:
**	The installation cannot be started until this error is resolved.
**
** Recommendation:
**	This error is most likely caused by an incomplete upgrade of the DBMS
**	software to a new version. Occasionally, upgrading the DBMS software
**	requires that the log file be re-initialized. This process is
**	described in detail in the Release Notes, but basically involves
**	the following steps:
**
**	    1) Shutdown the installation normally, after first allowing
**	        all recovery to complete (use "rcpconfig -shutdown",
**	        not "rcpconfig -imm_shutdown").
**	    2) Install the new version of the DBMS software.
**	    3) Re-initialize the log file with the new DBMS software
**	        by running "rcpconfig -init".
**	    4) Restart the installation.
**
**	If this error was caused by omitting step (3) above, you should
**	attempt to run "rcpconfig -init", then restart the installation.
**
**	If "rcpconfig -init" indicates that there are still active transactions
**	in the log file, you must restore the previous version of the DBMS
**	software and restart the installation using the previous version
**	of the software; then restart the upgrade process from step (1) above.

E_CL0F30_LG_NO_MASTER:SS50004_SYS_CONFIG_ERROR
"Could not initialize the logging system for this process because the RCP
process is not running.
This indicates that either the RCP abnormally exited,
or that the server has attempted to connect to the logging system before the
RCP was brought up.
Shutdown all processes associated with this installation, and bring up the
installation from scratch using the supported startup tools, documented in
the Command Reference Guide."
/*%
** Parameters:
**	None.
**
** Explanation:
**	Each installation contains a single process designated to be the
**	"master" of the logging and locking operations of that installation.
**	The dmfrcp process is the usual master process.  If this process
**	exits abnormally without running certain cleanup routines, it may
**	be possible for other processes to connect to the data structures
**	left about in shared memory, and get into a state where they wait
**	forever from a response from the non-existent "master" process.
**
**	A check for the existence of the "master" is performed whenever a
**	process connects to the logging system.  If the "master" process
**	does not exist then this error is returned.
**
**	This error indicates that the dmfrcp process has exited abnormally
**	(causes include "kill -9" and system coding errors).  A server cannot
**	be allowed to start when this condition exists, so this error is
**	returned.
**
**  System Status:
**	The process being started (the dmfacp or DBMS server) fails to
**	come up, printing error messages to the error log and possibly,
**	in the case of the dmfacp process, to the ACP log file.
**
**  Recommendation:
**	1. Check to see if a dmfrcp process is running in the installation.
**	   If one exists, this error may have been caused by a race condition
**	   between starting the process and starting the dmfrcp process.
**	   Try starting the server once more.
**	2. If 1 is not true, then:
**	   NOTE: The following should only be done by a System Administrator.
**	     a. Shut down the installation using "rcpconfig imm_shutdown".
**	     b. If any other processes remain active in the installation
**	        following this shutdown, then shut down these processes
**	        manually with the appropriate operating system command.
**	     c. Restart the installation from scratch using the appropriate
**	        startup command documented in the Installation
**	        Guide.

E_CL0F31_LG_CANT_OPEN:SS08004_CONNECTION_REJECTED
"Could not initialize the logging system for this process because the

permissions on the %2c log file."
/*%
** Parameters:
**	%0 - name of the recovery log file which the system attempted to open
**	%1 - Unix flag mask passed to the open() system call
**
** Explanation:
**	All transaction recovery information is written to a single log
**	file. The system's attempt to open this file has failed.
**
**  System Status:
**	The process being started halts with a fatal error.
**
**  Recommendation:
**	1) Check the file permissions on the recovery log file.
**	   This file should be owned by the same user who owns the rest
**	   of the installation.  The path to the file should be accessible 
**	   by the DBMS System Administrator.  The file must be readable 
**	   and writable by the DBMS System Administrator.
**
**	   Make sure that the environment variable II_LOG_FILE is not
**	   set in your local environment.
**
**	2) Check permissions on executables being run.  All executables
**	   which must access the recovery log file must have the "setuid"
**	   bit on and be owned by the DBMS System Administrator.  These 
**	   executables include: dmfacp, dmfrcp, dmfjsp, iidbms, csinstall, 
**	   and others.

this maximum size is user tunable by altering the SHMSIZE parameter in the
kernel configuration procedure."
/*%
** Parameters:
**	%0 - amount of shared memory requested (in bytes)
**
** Explanation:
**	Shared memory has been requested using the SystemV shmget() interface.
**	This routine has returned EINVAL, which can mean one of 2 things
**	(use "man shmget" for information specific to your OS):
**
**	    -  size is less than the system-imposed minimum or greater
**	       than the system imposed maximum.
**
**	    -  a shared memory identifier exists for key, but the size
**	       of the segment associated with it is less than size and
**	       size is not equal to zero.
**
**	The maximum size shared-memory segment a system can provide is site-
**	specific and is given by the system administrator-defined value assigned
**	to SHMSIZE (in 1k units).  This value usually is defaulted to 1024,
**	which sets an upper limit of 1 megabyte for a single shared memory
**	buffer.  This means that under a system configured with the defaults,
**	one may not start up a DBMS server using a shared buffer cache bigger
**	than 512 pages:
**
**	        512 pages * 2048 bytes/page = 1meg.
**
**	The value of SHMSIZE should be set to at least twice the number of
**	pages that you want to start up a DBMS server with. For instance,
**	if you want to start up a DBMS server with a 1024-page cache,
**	you should rebuild the kernel with SHMSIZE set to 2048 (actually, you
**	should set it slightly higher, since there is some amount of overhead
**	used by the DMF cache.)
**
**	This example assumes a 2048 byte page.
**
** System Status:
**	Server will not start up.
**
** Recommendation:
**	Either restart the server with the dmf.cache_size set to less than
**	1/2 the current value of SHMSIZE, or rebuild the kernel with SHMSIZE
**	increased enough to support the required size buffer cache.

** Parameters:
**	None.
**
** Explanation
**	The caller has requested locking memory on a system that does
**	not support either the mlock() or seteuid() function;  mlock()
**	is required to lock memory, seteuid() to set and reset executable

** Recommendation:
**	Reconfigure the server to not request memory locking.
