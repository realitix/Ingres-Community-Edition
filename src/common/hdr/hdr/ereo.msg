**	    Added F_EO0003_EXECFORLOCAL for local procedures.
**	12-apr-1993 (emerson)

The event name '%0c' is unknown.  Please check your Windows 4GL documentation
for the allowed event names."

/*%
** Arguments:
**	0	This is the name the user gave.
**
** Explanation:
**	The user gave a name for an event that is not known to the
**	system.
**
** System Status:
**	In the 4GL compiler this will be reported as an error and
**	the 4GL will not be successfully compiled.
**
** User Action:
**	Check the documentation to find the legal event names.
*/

E_EO0001_EVTBADCLASS	"Incorrect class of object for event '%0c'\n
The event '%0c' is not allowed on the class of the given object.
The allowed classes for this event are %1c or their(its) subclasses."

/*%
** Arguments:
**	0	This is the name of the event.
**
**	1	This is a list of the allowed classes that the
**		event can be issued on.
**
** Explanation:
**	The user tried to do an ON event for an object that doesn't
**	generate the given event.
**
** System Status:
**	In the 4GL compiler this will be reported as an error and
**	the 4GL will not be successfully compiled.

E_EO0002_FLUSH_NOWINDOW	"Flush invoked on non-window object.\n
The flush method was invoked on an executable object that does not have
a frame as an ancestor.  In general, Flush should be appled to CurFrame.
Flush can only be applied to CurProcedure if an ancestor of the current
procedure is a frame."

**	object that has a window available to it.
*/

E_EO0003_FLUSH_WAIT	"Error during flush.\n
A previous error was encountered that prohibited a flush from
being done.  Normally this means that flush wasn't done on
CurFrame or CurProcedure.  Only apply Flush to CurFrame or to
CurProcedure (but then only if the procedure has a frame as an
ancestor.)."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	The system uses the waitfor method to implement the
**	flush method.  During the execution of a flush, a waitfor
**	could not be done.  The problem with the waitfor will
**	be reported, and must be corrected for the waitfor to
**	run.
**
** System Status:
**	The Flush is not done.
**
** User Action:
**	Correct the previous error to get the flush to succeed.

procedure's database session will not be changed."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	The state of the DBSESSIONOBJECT in question was not DS_CONNECTED.
**	This means that the DBSESSIONOBJECT is not connected to a database

"The IsGridOn attribute of the framesource object may not be reflected in
the running frame."

E_EO001D_NOTAFRAME "Sender is not a frame, nor is it running under a frame.\n\
The 'errorevent' parameter can be used with the SendUserEvent method only
when the component sending the Userevent is a frame or a procedure called
from a frame (directly or indirectly)."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	The SendUserEvent was issued from a procedure in an application
**	which has not yet started any frames.  Since such procedures cannot
**	receive user events, you cannot specify an event to be sent back
**	to the calling component on error if the calling component is
**	such a procedure.
**
** System Status:
**	The userevent will be sent, but the errorevent parameter will
**	be ignored.
**
** User Action:
**	Remove the errorevent parameter, or send the event from a frame
**	or from a procedures called from a frame.

** Explanation:
**	The Windows/4GL interpreter detected a fatal error when it tried to
**	evaluate a dynamic expression for a getvalue, setvalue, or getfield
**	method.  A subsequent message will specify the error.  Likely causes
**	are (1) a VALUE or FIELD parameter of improper type was specified when
