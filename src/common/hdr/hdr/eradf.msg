** Parameters:

**

**
** Recommendation:
**	None required.  Alternative handling for arithmetic exceptions is

**
**	If these warnings were unexpected, they may be occurring because a
**	small value was truncated to zero while being coerced or converted
**	to a packed decimal number with insufficient scale to hold this small
**	number.  Using the decimal() conversion function to convert the
**	intermediate result to a value with more scale digits might help.
*/
E_AD0127_DECOVF_WARN:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR
"Warning: %0d Packed Decimal overflow(s) detected."
/*%
** Parameters:
**	%0d - number of overflows detected
**
** Explanation:
**	The operations ADF was asked to perform resulted in a packed decimal
**	expression or sub-expression whose result exceeded the number of
**	integral digits available in the result value.  Packed decimal result
**	precision and scale are calculated according to the formulas shown
**	in the documentation.  If an intermediate result has more
**	significant integral (i.e., to the left of the decimal point) digits
**	than were available in the result, overflow will occur.  Another
**	possibility is that an attempt was made to coerce or convert a number
**	with more significant integral digits to a packed decimal number
**	which did not have space for these integral digits.  This could occur
**	when assigning a value to a column in a table, or when using the
**	decimal() conversion function.
**
**	An example of overflow is easy to construct: decimal(123.1, 4, 2) will
**	cause packed decimal overflow, because the number of significant
**	integral digits in the number being converted exceeds the number
**	allowed for in the result.  (123.1 has 3 significant non-zero digits,
**	the resulting packed decimal number will have space for 4-2=2 integral
**	digits, which is insufficient.)
**
**	ADF was set to generate warnings for all arithmetic exceptions, so no
**	error was generated.
**
** System Status:
**	This is a warning message.  The results of all overflowed expressions
**	were set to zero.
**
** Recommendation:
**	None required.  Alternative handling for arithmetic exceptions is
**	available and fully explained in the documentation set.
**
**	If these warnings were unexpected, try simplifying the expression which
**	is generating this overflow until you can reproduce the problem with as
**	few variables, column names, arithmetic operators, etc. as possible.
**	Then, using the formulas given in the documentation, calculate
**	the result size for your simplified expression.  It should become clear
**	why the expression is overflowing.  Once you determine why the overflow
**	is occurring, you may want to use the decimal() conversion function to
**	change the precision and scale of your intermediate result, or if the
**	result is very large, you may want to convert to a floating point
**	datatype using the float4() or float8() conversion function.

** System Status:

*/
E_AD1127_DECOVF_ERROR:SS22003_NUM_VAL_OUT_OF_RANGE
"Packed Decimal overflow detected in query."
/*%
** Parameters:
**	None.
**
** Explanation:
**	The operation ADF was asked to perform resulted in a packed decimal
**	expression or sub-expression whose result exceeded the number of
**	integral digits available in the result value.  Packed decimal result
**	precision and scale are calculated according to the formulas shown
**	in the documentation.  If an intermediate result has more
**	significant integral (i.e., to the left of the decimal point) digits
**	than were available in the result, overflow will occur.  Another
**	possibility is that an attempt was made to coerce or convert a number
**	with more significant integral digits to a packed decimal number
**	which did not have space for these integral digits.  This could occur
**	when assigning a value to a column in a table, or when using the
**	decimal() conversion function.
**
**	An example of overflow is easy to construct: decimal(123.1, 4, 2) will
**	cause packed decimal overflow because the number of significant
**	integral digits in the number being converted exceeds the number
**	allowed for in the result.  (123.1 has 3 significant non-zero digits,
**	the resulting packed decimal number will have space for 4-2=2 integral
**	digits, which is insufficient.)
**
**	ADF was set to generate errors for all arithmetic exceptions, so this
**	query will be aborted.
**
** System Status:
**	The query was aborted.
**
** Recommendation:
**	If this error was unexpected, try simplifying the expression which
**	is generating this overflow until you can reproduce the problem with as
**	few variables, column names, arithmetic operators, etc. as possible.
**	Then using the formulas given in the documentation, calculate
**	the result size for your simplified expression.  It should become clear
**	why the expression is overflowing.  Once you determine why the overflow
**	is occurring, you may want to use the decimal() conversion function to
**	change the precision and scale of your intermediate result, or if the
**	result is very large, you may want to convert to a floating point
**	datatype using the float4() or float8() conversion function.
**
**	Alternative handling for arithmetic exceptions is available and fully
**	explained in the documentation set.
