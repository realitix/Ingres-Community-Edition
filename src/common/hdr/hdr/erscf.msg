E_SC029A_EVENT_CLUSTER_INIT:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS
"This server cannot connect to the Event System because it is not yet
initialized.  In a Cluster Installation, the cluster process (CSP)
must initialize the Event System so that dbevents can be properly signaled
to other nodes.  In this installation, the CSP is not connected to the
Event System.  This probably means that the Event System was not enabled
at the time that the installation was started, but has since been modified
to indicate that dbevents should be used.  To enable the Event System, the
installation on this node must be stopped and restarted.  To start a server
without dbevent connecting to the Event System, use the EVENTS=0 startup option."
/*%
** Parameters:
**	None.
**
** Explanation:
**	The Event System is initialized by the first process which
**	connects to it.  In a cluster installation, this must be the CSP
**	process.  If a server on a cluster installation finds that it is
**	the first connector to the Event System, then it will fail to
**	start up.  This is because it will be unable to properly communicate
**	dbevents to other nodes of the installation.
**
**	This error will most likely occur if the system is initialized while
**	dbevents are not enabled in the installation, and then later the
**	system is modified to specify that dbevents should be used.  Servers
**	that start up after dbevents have been enabled will try to connect
**	to the Event System, generating this error.
**
**	After enabling dbevents in an installation in which they were previously
**	disabled, the entire installation should be brought down and restarted.
**
** System Status:
**	The server will not start up until either dbevents are explicitly
**	turned off, or until the installation is restarted so that the CSP
**	can be connected to the Event System.
**
** Recommendation:
**	To start a server with dbevent handling, restart the installation to
**	connect the CSP to the Event System.
**
**	In order to start a server without restarting the installation, the
**	server must be started with options specifying to not do dbevent
**	processing.  This is done by using the EVENTS=0 startup option, or
**	by turning off dbevents in the installation with the Event Utility.

"Event Subsystem: Registered server %0x has been disabled from receiving

/*%
** Parameters:
**	%0x - process ID of server registered for the dbevent

**
** Explanation:
**	The event subsystem (EV) attempted to raise a dbevent to all servers

**	either the receiving server was abnormally terminated, or the event

**
** Recommendation:
**	Check the installation error log to determine why the identified server

/*%
** Parameters:
**      %c - column name.
**      %d - length in error

**
** Explanation:
**      A VARCHAR, NVARCHAR, TEXT or VARBYTE column contained a
**      length field too large for the column definition. This could
**      indicate a data curruption or a programming error.
**      The length field will have been reset to match the column
**      length.
**
** System Status:
**      None
**
** Recommendation:
**      Identify the offending data. A comparison between LENGTH(x)
**      and SIZE(x) of a column should show LENGTH <= SIZE for varying
**      columns. If this affects every row of a column it could
**      indicate a corrupt catalog. If limited to an isolated column
**      it could indicate a local date corruption or programming error.
