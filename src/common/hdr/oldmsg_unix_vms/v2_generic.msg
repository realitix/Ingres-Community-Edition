"Warning: %0d Packed Decimal overflow(s) detected."
/*%
** Parameters:
**      %0d	Number of overflows detected
**
** Description:
**	The operations ADF was asked to perform resulted in a packed decimal
**	expression or sub-expression whose result exceeded the number of
**	integral digits available in the result value.  Packed decimal result
**	precision and scale are calculated according to the formulas shown
**	in the INGRES documentation.  If an intermediate result has more
**	significant integral (i.e. to the left of the decimal point) digits
**	than were available in the result, overflow will occur.  Another
**	possibility is that an attempt was made to coerce or convert a number
**	with more significant integral digits to a packed decimal number
**	which did not have space for these integral digits.  This could occur
**	when assigning a value to a column in a table, or when using the
**	decimal() conversion function.
**
**	An example of overflow is easy to construct: decimal(123.1, 4, 2) will
**	cause packed decimal overflow because the number of significant
**	integral digits in the number being converted exceeds the number
**	allowed for in the result.  (123.1 has 3 significant non-zero digits,
**	the resulting packed decimal number will have space for 4-2=2 integral
**	digits, which is insufficient.)
**
**	ADF was set to generate warnings for all arithmetic exceptions, so no
**	error was generated.
**
** System Status:
**	This is just a warning message.  The results of all overflowed
**	expressions were set to zero.
**
** User Action:
**	None required.  Alternative handling for arithmetic exceptions is
**	available and fully explained in the INGRES documentation set.
**
**	If these warnings were unexpected, try simplifying the expression which
**	is generating this overflow until you can reproduce the problem with as
**	few variables, column names, arithmetic operators, etc. as possible.
**	Then using the formulas given in the INGRES documentation, calculate
**	the result size for your simplified expression.  It should become clear
**	why the expression is overflowing.  Once you determine why the overflow
**	is occurring, you may wish to use the decimal() conversion function to
**	change the precision and scale of your intermediate result, or if the
**	result is very large, you may wish to convert to a floating point
**	datatype using the float4() or float8() conversion function.

** Parameters:
**	None
**
** Description:
**	The locate() function takes two arguments, both of which must have
**	a string datatype (a string datatype is one of: C, TEXT, CHAR, or
**	VARCHAR).  You have given it some parameter whose datatype is none
**	of these.
**
** System Status:
**	The current query will be aborted.
**
** User Action:
**	Explicitly convert any non-string datatypes to string datatypes.  For
**	example, if you are trying to find the first occurrence of x in the
**	string '32123' where x is an integer column, you cannot use
**	locate('32123', x) because the second parameter is an non-string type.
**	Instead use locate('32123', varchar(x)).

RCP was brought up.
Shutdown all processes associated with this installation, and bring up the
installation from scratch using the supported startup tools, documented in
Installation and Operations guide."
/*
** Parameters:
**	none.
**
** Explanation:
**	Each installation contains a single process designated to be the
**	"master" of the logging and locking operations of that installation.
**	The process named "dmfrcp" is the usual master process.  If this
**	process exits abnormally without running certain cleanup routines
**	it may be possible for other processes to connect to the data
**	structures left about in shared memory, and get into a state where
**	they wait forever from a response from the non-existent "master"
**	process.
**
**	A check for the existence of the "master" is performed whenever a
**	process connects to the logging system.  If the "master" process
**	does not exist then this error is returned.
**
**	This error indicates that the dmfrcp process
**	has exited abnormally (causes include "kill -9" and system coding
**	errors).  A server cannot be allowed to start up when this condition
**	exists, so this error is returned.
**
**  System Status:
**	The process being started up (the dmfacp or dbms server) fails to
**	come up, printing error messages to the error log (errlog.log), 
**	and possibly, in the case of the dmfacp, to the II_ACP.LOG file.
**
**  User Action:
**	1. Check to see if a "dmfrcp" process is running in you're
**	   installation.  If one exists, this error may have been caused
**	   by a race condition between starting you're process and 
**	   starting the "dmfrcp" process.  Try starting you're server
**	   once more.
**	2. IF 1 is not true THEN:
**	All the following should only be done by a System Administrator.
**	  a. Shutdown entire installation using "rcpconfig" with the
**	     "imm_shutdown" option.
**	  b. If any other processes remain active in your installation
**	     following this shutdown,  then shutdown these processes manually 
**	     with the appropriate operating system command.
**	  c. Restart the installation from scratch using the appropriate
**	     startup command documented in you're Installation and Operations
**	     guide.

** Parameters:
**	%0  The name of the recovery log file which the system attempted to open.

**
** Explanation:
**	All transaction recovery information is written to a single log
**	file.  The file is expected to be found in a file named:
**	$II_LOG_FILE/ingres/log/ingres_log.  For some reason the system's
**	attempt to open this file has failed.
**
**  System Status:
**	The process being started up halts with a fatal error.
**
**  User Action:
**	1) Check the file permissions on the Ingres recovery log file.
**
**	   This file is located in $II_LOG_FILE/ingres/log/ingres_log,
**	   where $II_LOG_FILE is the value of II_LOG_FILE printed when
**	   the "ingprenv" command is issued.
**
**	   This file should be owned by the same user who owns the rest
**	   of the Ingres installation (ie. usually "ingres").  The 
**	   path to the file should be accessible by the "ingres" user.
**	   The file must be readable and writable by the "ingres" user.
**
**	   Make sure that the environment variable II_LOG_FILE is not
**	   set in your local shell environment.
**
**	2) Check permissions on executables being run.
**	   
**	   All executables which must access the recovery log file must
**	   have the "setuid" bit on and be owned by the "ingres" user.
**	   These executables include: dmfacp, dmfrcp, dmfjsp, iidbms, 
**	   csinstall, and others.

this maximum size is user tunable by altering the SHMSIZE parameter in the
kernel configuration procedure."
/*
** Parameters:
**	%0	amount in bytes of shared memory requested.
** Explanation:
**	Shared memory has been requested using the system V "shmget" interface.
**	This routine has returned "EINVAL" which can mean one of 2 things
**	(see "man shmget" for information specific to you're OS):
**
**     		size is less than the system-imposed minimum or greater
**     		than the system imposed maximum.
**
**     		A shared memory identifier exists for key but
**     		the size of the segment associ- ated with it is less
**     		than size and size is not equal to zero.
**
**	The maximum size shared memory segment a system can provide is site
**	specific and is given by the system administrator defined value assigned
**	to SHMSIZE (in 1k units).  This value usually is defaulted to 1024,
**	which sets an upper limit of 1 megabyte for a single shared memory
**	buffer.  This means that under a system configured with the defaults
**	one may not start up a dbms server using a shared buffer cache bigger
**	than 512 ingres pages:
**
**		512 ingres pages * 2048 bytes/ingres page = 1meg.
**
**	The value of SHMSIZE should be set to at least twice the number of
**	ingres pages that you wish to start up a dbms server with.  For instance
**	if you want to start up an ingres server with a 1024 page ingres cache
**	you should rebuild the kernel with SHMSIZE set to 2048 (actually you
**	should set it slightly higher since there is some amount of overhead
**	used by the dmf cache.)
**	
** System Status:
**	Server will not start up. 
** User Action:
**	Either restart server with the dmf.cache_size set to less than 1/2 the
**	current value of SHMSIZE, or rebuild the kernel with SHMSIZE increased
**	enough to support the required size buffer cache.

/*
** Parameters:
**      none.
** Explanation:
**	An owner of a semaphore controlling access to a resource shared across
**	processes has exited.  The requesting process would "wait" forever for
**      access to this resource if this error were not returned (possibly 
**	spinning using all available cpu on the machine).
**
** System Status:
**	Either the server or the installation will be shutdown (depending on
**	whether the resource is server or installation critical).  In 6.3 there
**	is a single semaphore controlling access to the buffer manager which
**	is server critical.  There are a few semaphores which control access to
**	the logging and locking components which are installation critical.
**
** User Action:
**      Either restart server, or installation depending on whether the server
**	or installation depending on what was shut down.  Information in the
**	errlog.log may point to the cause of the semaphore failure.

an online checkpoint may be marked invalid if the Archiver was
unable to copy the journal and dump file information to the journal
and dump directories (check the Archiver error log for messages).
You can restore your database from the most recent valid checkpoint
by issuing the rollforwarddb command with the '#c' argument. In a
future release this action will be taken automatically."

/*%
** Parameters:
**	None
**
** Explanation:
**	This message is issued by the rollforwarddb utility when the checkpoint
**	which was to be used is discovered to be unusable. In order for a
**	checkpoint to be usuable for rolling forward a database, the backup
**	operation must have successfully written all the locations which
**	comprise the database to the backup area (whether disk or tape).
**
**	Additionally, if the checkpoint was an Online Checkpoint, the archiver
**	must have successfully copied all the transaction and backup information
**	from the Ingres Log File to the Journal and Dump files associated with
**	this checkpoint.
**
**	If any or all of these operations fail, the checkpoint is marked as
**	INVALID and cannot be used for rolling forward the database.
**
** System Status:
**	The rollforwarddb operation is aborted. The database is unaltered. No
**	action has been taken on the database.
**
** User Action:
**	Depending on what has been done with this database in the past, there
**	may be a valid checkpoint earlier in the history of this database. The
**	'infodb' utility may be used to display the checkpoint history of
**	this database. If a previous checkpoint is marked as valid, the database
**	can be recovered by rolling forward from the previous checkpoint.
**
**	You can restore your database from the most recent valid checkpoint by
**	re-issuing the rollforwarddb command with the '#c' argument.
**
**	If the '#c' argument is used, the database will be rolled back to the
**	most recent valid checkpoint, and then the database will be rolled
**	forward by re-applying all transactions which have been executed since
**	the checkpoint was taken. The transaction information is kept in the
**	journal files.

**	It uses a bit map to do this.  In this case, patch table was not able
**	to allocate memory (1 bit per page for btree, 2 bits/page for hash/heap.
** System Status:
**	This is an informative message printed during the check/patch operation.
** User Action:
**	User may wish to reconfigure system to provide more memory for server.
**	If there were other diagnostic messages, then user may wish to patch
**	table instead.  (Patching the table takes much less memory than
**	checking it.)

** Explanation:
**	A bad row was encountered in the database that could not be

**
**	If the error is returned on an insert, then the bad row will not be

** System Status:
**	Query will be rejected in normal case and the transaction aborted.
**	The error recovery actions can be altered by the trace flags below.
** User Action:
**	If this error is returned on a SELECT statement then there is probably
**	a bad row in the database.  The user should do a select by TID of the
**	reported row to make sure that it is really bad.  The table should be
**	recovered - methods for doing this are described below.
**
**	The supported method of fixing a table like this is to recover it from
**	the last checkpoint.  If this is not practical or possible, the table
**	can be patched by removing the offending row.  There are two trace
**	flags provided for this - these are undocumented trace flags that are

**
**	SET TRACE POINT DM801 will cause DMF to skip bad rows like this when

**
**		set trace point DM801
**		modify table to storage_structure
**
**	which would have the effect of rebuilding the table without any
**	of the offending rows.
**
**	SET TRACE POINT DM802 will cause DMF to return a garbage row when a
**	bad row is encountered.  This allows the user to do
**
**		set trace point DM802
**		delete table where table.tid = BAD_TID
**		set notrace point DM802

**	This will delete the offending row directly.  This is the only operation

E_DM9396_BT_WRONG_PAGE_FIXED:NO_GE
"A protocol error occurred during update of a Btree index page on table
(%0c, %1c).  The wrong page was passed in by the caller of the btree routine.
Page %2d was being updated but page %3d was held by the caller.  The entry
being updated was %4x (TID %5x).  This error indicates an internal DBMS bug
and should be reported to Ingres Technical Support." 
/*%
** Parameters:
**	%0	The Name of the table being updated.
**	%1	The Owner of the table being updated.
**	%2	The page number which should have been fixed.
**      %3	The page number which was fixed.
**	%4	The Btree Id of the leaf entry being updated.
**	%5	The Tuple Id of the row being updated.
**
** Explanation:
**	This is an internal consistency check in the btree update code.
**	If code in the DBMS passes in the wrong page to the btree update
**	routines, then this error will be generated.  There should be
**	no user error or hardware/environment problem which can cause this
**	error.

** User Action:
**	Report the error as an Ingres bug.
**	Check the table for btree consistency problems.

"A Buffer Manager protocol error occurred during processing of a Consistency
Point.  All buffers could not be flushed during the CP.  The error occurred
on buffer # %0d.  Buffer information: Table_id (%1d, %2d), status: %3x,
cp_count %4d (%5d), ref_count %6d, tcb %7x, validation value %8d (%9d)." 
/*%
** Parameters:
**	%0	The buffer which was skipped.

**	%7	The server's TCB pointer for the buffer's table.
**	%8	The buffer's tcb validation value.
**	%9	The validation stamp in the TCB.
**
** Explanation:
**	This error is written just prior to the server shutting down due to an
**	error executing a consistency point.  If at the end of processing a
**	consistency point, a server notices that it has not flushed all the
**	necessary pages from the buffer manager, it will signal a protocol
**	error.  This message attempts to output enough useful information to
**	help track down the cause of the error.
** 
** System Status:
**	The server will crash shortly after logging this error.
**
** User Action:
**	Report the error as an Ingres bug.
**	Save the error log.  If there is a dbms trace file then save that as
**	it will contain the dmdcheck which is to follow.  If there is no
**	dbms trace file then define one when the server is restarted so that

/*
** Parameters:
**	None
** Explanation:
**	The Buffer Manager keeps an internal count of the number of servers
**	which are connected to it.  When servers start up or shut down, they
**	are expected to increment/decrement this count accordingly.
**
**	Each server connected to a buffer manager holds a shared buffer manager
**	lock on its server lock list.  At strategic times (server startup and
**	at consistency points) servers will check the number of holders
**	of the buffer manager lock and compare it with the connect count.
**	If the counts do not match then some server has exited without adjusting
**	the connect count.
**
**	This is currently considered a fatal error as the buffer manager is
**	left in an unpredictable state - lists may be trashed and data may
**	be corrupt.
**
**	When this message is displayed, it means that DMF is shutting down the
**	server.
**
** System Status:
**	Server is shut down.  All other servers connected to this same buffer
**	manager will also be shut down automatically.
** User Action:
**	Restart servers - examine log to see reason why original server exited
**	abnormally.  This could have happened due to a server fatal error or
**	because the user stopped the dbms server process rather than shutting
**	it down normally.

**  Parameters:
**	%0  Maximum nesting level for database procedures.
**
**  Explanation:
**	This error will occur when executing queries that trigger rule

**	Each such nested rule firing causes the execution of the database

**
**	The following are possible causes of this error:
**
**	    1. The collection of rules defined in the database establishes

** Parameters:
**	None
** Explanation:
**	Version 3 query trees should never have more than PST_3NUMVARS [30]
**	range table entries.  However, this version 3 query tree has more than
**	30 range entries.  This indicates that the dbms catalogs are damaged
**	or inconsistent.  Either the tree version is incorrect or the data
**	contained in the tree is corrupted.  RDF cannot guess what is wrong and
**	attempt a recovery.  There is no way to determine what the correct
**	number of range entries is, and reading the rest of the tree depends on
**	knowning this.
** System Status:
**	The statement is aborted and RDF complains that it cannot read the
**	query tree.
** User Action:
**	The dbms system catalogs are corrupted.  It may not be possible to
**	fix the query tree.  HOwever, the user should be able to find the

**	RDF did a ulh_define_alias call, and ulh returned error

**
**	In this case, RDF was attempting to create an alias to a table name, so

/*%
** Parameters:
**	none.
** Explanation:
**	RDF accepts startup parameters from iirundbms command file (located
**	in the utility subdirectory of ingres
**	  ($II_SYSTEM/ingres/utility/iirundbms on unix and
**	   ii_system:[ingres.utility]iirundbms.com_<node_name> on VMS)
**	One of those parameters, max_tbls, indicates the max number of tables
**	RDF may have on its cache (the default is 300).  Another parameter,
**	tbl_synonyms, tells how many synonyms may be defined for each table (the
**	default is 1).
**
**	You may have your system configured reasonably, but alot of concurrent
**	activity is keeping RDF memory usage too high to add another synonym to
**	RDF's memory cache.  Or, you system may not be configured correctly for
**	RDF.
**
**	In either case, you can improve the situation by increasing the
**	number of synonyms permitted per table:
**
**	    \RDF=(max_tbls=xxxx, tbl_synonyms=xxxx)
**
**	where xxxx is a large number than the current (if specified) or
**	default (if not specified) values.  The tradeoff is that the dbms server
**	will use more memory when you increase these values.
**	
** System Status:
**	The statement continues running, but will be a bit slower, because the
**	server will have to go to disk next time it needs this information
**	instead of getting it from memory.
** User Action:
**	user may reconfigure RDF startup parameters and restart server.

"This server cannot connect to the Event System because it is not yet
initialized.  In an Ingres Cluster Installation, the cluster process (CSP)
must initialize the Event System so that events can be properly signaled
to other nodes.  In this installation, the CSP is not connected to the
Event System.  This probably means that the Event System was not enabled
at the time that the installation was started, but has since been modified
to indicate that events should be used.  To enable the Event System, the
installation on this node must be stopped and restarted.  To start a server
without event connecting to the Event System, use the NOEVENTS startup option."
/*%
** Parameters:
**	None.
**
** Description:
**	The Ingres Event System is initialized by the first process which
**	connects to it.  In a cluster installation, this must be the CSP
**	process.  If a server on a cluster installation finds that it is
**	the first connector to the Event System, then it will fail to
**	start up.  This is because it will be unable to properly communicate
**	events to other nodes of the Ingres Installation.
**
**	This error will most likely occur if the system is initialized while
**	events are not enabled in the installation, and then later the
**	system is modified to specify that events should be used.  Servers
**	that start up after events have been enabled will try to connect
**	to the Event System, generating this error.
**
**	After enabling events in an installation in which they were previously
**	disabled, the entire installation should be brought down and restarted.
**
** System Status:
**	The server will not start up until either events are explicitly
**	turned off, or until the installation is restarted so that the CSP
**	can be connected to the Event System.
**
** User Action:
**	To start a server with event handling, restart the installation to
**	connect the CSP to the Event System.
**
**	In order to start a server without restarting the installation, the
**	server must be started with options specifying to not do event
**	processing.  This is done by using the NOEVENTS startup option or
**	by turning off events in the installation with the Event Utility.

** Parameters: (none)
**	%0 - Name of the type of attribute being created.
**	%1 - Name of the attribute being created.
**
** Explanation:
**	This message is issued by PSF when a system_maintained column
**	is specified in a CREATE TABLE statement on a datatype which 
**	doesn't support 'with system_maintained'.  Currently only the

** System Status:
**	Current statement is aborted.
**
** User Action:
**	Reissue the CREATE TABLE statement after correcting the offending
**	attribute declaration.

** Explanation:
**	The accepted syntax diagram for the column qualifier clause is:
