    ** Explanation:
    **  Table iilocation keeps a list of INGRES location names and what

    **	    destroydb will destroy databases if it can find entries for it in
    **	    iidatabase and iiextend.  It removes any entries that exist from
    **	    the iidbdb then destroys the directories associated with the
    **	    database.  This means that it would be possible to destroy 5.0 dbs
    **	    from 6.0 ingres.  That would leave the 5.0 catalogs indicating the
    **	    database exists but the directories would be missing.  Therefore,
    **	    destroydb refuses to destroy dbs that are marked as DU_CONVERTING,
    **	    unless the -p option is selected and the user gives permission.
    **
    **  System Status:
    **	    Destroydb prints a warning.  It will prompt the user for permission
    **	    to destroy this db, and will do so if permission is given.  This

    **	    did not really mean to destroy the db.
    **  User Action:
    **	    User must determine whether or not this db is known to the 5.0

    **	Explanation:
    **	    VERIFYDB was not able to open the VERIFYDB log file (currently

    **	    without the log file (I don't recommend this as a regular practice)
    **	    by using the -n flag before any of the other VERIFYDB parameters.
    **	    Example:  if your command line was
    **			VERIFYDB -mruni -sdbn test1 -odbms
    **		then type:
    **			VERIFYDB -n -mruni -sdbn test1 -odbms
    **	System Status:
    **	    VERIFYDB considers it an error if it is unable to open its log
    **	    file.  In such a case, VERIFYDB will print this error message and
    **	    terminate processing.  VERIFYDB will never print this error if the
    **	    -n flag is used.
    **	User Action:
    **	    The best thing to do is to see if anyone else in the installation
    **	    is running VERIFYDB.  If so, wait til they're finished.  If not,
    **	    check the logical ii_config to assure that its valid (an undefined
    **	    or improperly defined ii_config will also cause this message.  
    ***	    Of course, you can always bypass logging by using the -n flag.

**	The ABF run-time system found a NULL reference to a routine in its

** Explanation:

**	The look-up frame allows a user to select values from a list and then

/*%
** Parameters:
**	%0c	Internal name of message buffer (for example GCA_TUPLES).
**	%1c	Size of message buffer in bytes.
**
** Explanation:
**	During a pre-fetch operation (for example, when fetching multiple rows
**	of data from a read-only cursor), the run-time system attempts to
**	allocate unread message buffers to improve the performance of
**	subsequent retrievals against the same data.  When trying to allocate
**	one such buffer the system encountered a memory failure.  This is
**	normally due to memory resources being exhausted for the process.
**	
** System Status:
**	The run-time system aborts the current operation.  If this is a cursor

**	a number of "following" pre-fetched rows will have been discarded.
**
** User Action:
**	Confirm that you are not encountering unrelated memory errors that
**	could be due to your program corrupting the internal memory management
**	lists.  If this only occurs when trying to pre-fetch data then maybe
**	the system has exhausted all memory.  For example, a large number of
**	read-only cursors all open at the same time, all having set
**	the PREFETCHROWS value to a very large number, may encounter this

/*%
** Parameters:
**	%0c	Internal name of message buffer (for example GCA_TUPLES).
**	%1c	Number of rows originally requested for pre-fetch operation.
**	%2c	Number of rows encountered so far.
**
** Explanation:
**	During a pre-fetch operation (for example, when fetching multiple rows
**	of data from a read-only cursor), the run-time system collects unread
**	rows from the DBMS and saves them away for subsequent retrievals.
**	The requested number of rows (determined by the PREFETCHROWS setting or
**	the system default) has been exceeded, in violation of the
**	client-server GCA protocol.  
**	
**	A message type of GCA_TUPLES indicates that the actual data exceeded
**	the row count.  A message type of GCA_RESPONSE indicates that the
**	internal DBMS response count exceeded the value, though the data may
**	have been correct (this latter problem is less severe).
**
** System Status:
**	The run-time system aborts the current operation.  If this is a cursor

/*%
** Parameters:
**	%0c	Number of bytes expected to read.

E_LQ0001_STARTUP	"Failed to connect to DBMS session."

/*
** Explanation:
**	The attempt to connect to a DBMS failed.  Prior to this error
**	message there should have been another error message displayed.
**	This message is only displayed if the failure was not due to
**	obvious reasons, such as non-existent database, wrong permissions,
**	or an invalid command-line flag.  This message will usually be
**	displayed if the communications system failed.

E_LQ0002_USTARTUP	"Failure to connect to DBMS.  Operating system error %0c."

/*
** Explanation:
**	Under certain circumstances the failure to connect to a DBMS is due
**	to operation system reasons.  For example lack of process resources
**	or quotas.  If this is the reason, then an attempt will be made to 
**	display the system error message text so that the system administrator
**	or DBA can be informed.

** Arguments:
**	%0 - Digit stream extracted from the internal FLOAT8.

**
** Explanation:
**	When retrieving from INGRES into a COMP or COMP-3 scaled data-item
**	the preprocessor uses a temporary internal floating-point data-item

**
** Explanation:
**	Some C routines have been provided to allow you to use COMP-3

**	interface is hard-coded.  In that case all arguments are validated

**
** System Status:

**
** User Action:
**	Terminate the string with a string delimiter character.  Or, if you

**	9/20/88 (elein)
**		B3376 Added error message E_RW13E9 for rbf default reports.
**      12-dec-88 (sylviap)
**              Added error E_RW1084_.  In 6.1, adf does not support sum or avg
**                 of a date datatype.  Called from r_p_agg.
**              Changed msg 13E9 to say 'characters wide', not 'columns wide'.
**      26-jul-89 (sylviap)
**              Added E_RW13F0 - for bug 7011.
**      06-oct-89 (sylviap)
**              Fixed E_RW0036_r_nxt_set__Bad_break_ to use %c rather than %s.
**              Was getting 'Internal error' msg.  Added E_RW13F9_Bad_Break
**              to be called rather than E_RW0036.
**      13-oct-89 (sylviap)
**		Added E_RW13FA because RW is no longer supporting the -c flag.
**	12/21/89 (elein)
**		Corrected msgs which are missing param number.  Note that
**		the messages used by IIUG routines require the param number.
**		The DOS group found some of these.

**	in a given language and are used for checking both prompt responses and
**	values entered in fields.  Up to five values each are supported for a
**	positive or negative response.  These are case insensitive since the

**
**	Not all five choices need be specified; leave the last few the same as
**	the first (as is done in the English file) if this is the case.  Note
**	that all the prefixes that are to be allowed for a response should be
**	specified.  Also note that the first choice, F_UG0001_Yes1, is to be
**	used as the one character representation of "Yes", and the second
