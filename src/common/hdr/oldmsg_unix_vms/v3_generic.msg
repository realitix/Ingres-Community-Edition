** Parameters:

**
** Description:
**      The operations ADF was asked to perform resulted in a division where

**      available and fully explained in the INGRES documentation set.
**
**      If these warnings were unexpected, they may be occurring because a
**      small value was truncated to zero while being coerced or converted
**      to a packed decimal number with insufficient scale to hold this small
**      number.  Using the decimal() conversion function to convert the

E_AD0127_DECOVF_WARN:E_GE98BC_OTHER_ERROR
"Warning: %0d Packed Decimal overflow(s) detected."
/*%
** Parameters:
**      %0d     Number of overflows detected
**
** Description:
**      The operations ADF was asked to perform resulted in a packed decimal
**      expression or sub-expression whose result exceeded the number of
**      integral digits available in the result value.  Packed decimal result
**      precision and scale are calculated according to the formulas shown
**      in the INGRES documentation.  If an intermediate result has more
**      significant integral (i.e. to the left of the decimal point) digits
**      than were available in the result, overflow will occur.  Another
**      possibility is that an attempt was made to coerce or convert a number
**      with more significant integral digits to a packed decimal number
**      which did not have space for these integral digits.  This could occur
**      when assigning a value to a column in a table, or when using the
**      decimal() conversion function.
**
**      An example of overflow is easy to construct: decimal(123.1, 4, 2) will
**      cause packed decimal overflow because the number of significant
**      integral digits in the number being converted exceeds the number
**      allowed for in the result.  (123.1 has 3 significant non-zero digits,
**      the resulting packed decimal number will have space for 4-2=2 integral
**      digits, which is insufficient.)
**
**      ADF was set to generate warnings for all arithmetic exceptions, so no
**      error was generated.
**
** System Status:
**      This is just a warning message.  The results of all overflowed
**      expressions were set to zero.
**
** User Action:
**      None required.  Alternative handling for arithmetic exceptions is
**      available and fully explained in the INGRES documentation set.
**
**      If these warnings were unexpected, try simplifying the expression which
**      is generating this overflow until you can reproduce the problem with as
**      few variables, column names, arithmetic operators, etc. as possible.
**      Then using the formulas given in the INGRES documentation, calculate
**      the result size for your simplified expression.  It should become clear
**      why the expression is overflowing.  Once you determine why the overflow
**      is occurring, you may wish to use the decimal() conversion function to
**      change the precision and scale of your intermediate result, or if the
**      result is very large, you may wish to convert to a floating point
**      datatype using the float4() or float8() conversion function.

/*%
** Parameters:
**      None
**
** Description:
**      When the Ingres Recovery Process (DMFRCP) is first started, it opens
**      the Ingres log file and performs any recovery actions needed.
**
**      The first step in this process is to verify that the Ingres log file
**      has been initialized by the current version of the Ingres software.
**
**      A version number is recorded in the Ingres log file header; this version
**      number must match the version number compiled into the DMFRCP process.
**      If the version numbers do not match, the DMFRCP process refuses to
**      start.
**
** System Status:
**      The Ingres installation cannot be started until this error is resolved.
**
** User Action:
**      This error is most likely caused by an incomplete upgrade of the Ingres
**      software to a new version. Occasionally, upgrading the Ingres software
**      requires that the Ingres log file be re-initialized. This process is
**      described in detail in the Ingres Release Notes, but basically involves
**      the following steps:
**
**          1) Shutdown the Ingres installation normally, after first allowing
**              all Ingres recovery to complete (i.e., use rcpconfig -shutdown,
**              not rcpconfig -imm_shutdown).
**          2) Install the new version of the Ingres software.
**          3) Re-initialize the Ingres log file with the new Ingres software
**              by running rcpconfig -init.
**          4) Start the Ingres installation up using iistartup.
**
**      If this error was caused by ommitting step (3) above, then you should
**      attempt to run rcpconfig -init, then restart the Ingres installation.
**
**      If rcpconfig -init indicates that there are still active transactions
**      in the log file, then you must restore the previous version of the
**      Ingres software and restart the Ingres installation using the previous
**      version of the software; then restart the upgrade process from step (1)
**      above.

E_CL0F30_LG_NO_MASTER:E_GE8D68_CONFIG_ERROR
"Could not initialize the logging system for this process because the RCP
process is not running.
This indicates that either the RCP abnormally exited,
or that the server has attempted to connect to the logging system before the
RCP was brought up.
Shutdown all processes associated with this installation, and bring up the
installation from scratch using the supported startup tools, documented in
Installation and Operations guide."
/*
** Parameters:
**      none.
**
** Explanation:
**      Each installation contains a single process designated to be the
**      "master" of the logging and locking operations of that installation.
**      The process named "dmfrcp" is the usual master process.  If this
**      process exits abnormally without running certain cleanup routines
**      it may be possible for other processes to connect to the data
**      structures left about in shared memory, and get into a state where
**      they wait forever from a response from the non-existent "master"
**      process.
**
**      A check for the existence of the "master" is performed whenever a
**      process connects to the logging system.  If the "master" process
**      does not exist then this error is returned.
**
**      This error indicates that the dmfrcp process
**      has exited abnormally (causes include "kill -9" and system coding
**      errors).  A server cannot be allowed to start up when this condition
**      exists, so this error is returned.
**
**  System Status:
**      The process being started up (the dmfacp or dbms server) fails to
**      come up, printing error messages to the error log (errlog.log),
**      and possibly, in the case of the dmfacp, to the II_ACP.LOG file.
**
**  User Action:
**      1. Check to see if a "dmfrcp" process is running in you're
**         installation.  If one exists, this error may have been caused
**         by a race condition between starting you're process and
**         starting the "dmfrcp" process.  Try starting you're server
**         once more.
**      2. IF 1 is not true THEN:
**      All the following should only be done by a System Administrator.
**        a. Shutdown entire installation using "rcpconfig" with the
**           "imm_shutdown" option.
**        b. If any other processes remain active in your installation
**           following this shutdown,  then shutdown these processes manually
**           with the appropriate operating system command.
**        c. Restart the installation from scratch using the appropriate
**           startup command documented in you're Installation and Operations
**           guide.

E_CL0F31_LG_CANT_OPEN:E_GE94D4_HOST_ERROR
"Could not initialize the logging system for this process because the
database recovery log file (%0c) could not be opened.  We attempted to
open the file with the a flag mask of (%1c).  Check the ownership and
permissions on the Ingres log file."
/*
** Parameters:
**      %0  The name of the recovery log file which the system attempted to open.
**      %1  The unix flag mask passed to the open() system call.
**
** Explanation:
**      All transaction recovery information is written to a single log
**      file.  The file is expected to be found in a file named:
**      $II_LOG_FILE/ingres/log/ingres_log.  For some reason the system's
**      attempt to open this file has failed.
**
**  System Status:
**      The process being started up halts with a fatal error.
**
**  User Action:
**      1) Check the file permissions on the Ingres recovery log file.
**
**         This file is located in $II_LOG_FILE/ingres/log/ingres_log,
**         where $II_LOG_FILE is the value of II_LOG_FILE printed when
**         the "ingprenv" command is issued.
**
**         This file should be owned by the same user who owns the rest
**         of the Ingres installation (ie. usually "ingres").  The
**         path to the file should be accessible by the "ingres" user.
**         The file must be readable and writable by the "ingres" user.
**
**         Make sure that the environment variable II_LOG_FILE is not
**         set in your local shell environment.
**
**      2) Check permissions on executables being run.
**
**         All executables which must access the recovery log file must
**         have the "setuid" bit on and be owned by the "ingres" user.
**         These executables include: dmfacp, dmfrcp, dmfjsp, iidbms,
**         csinstall, and others.

the OS.  In most system V interface compliant shared memory OS implementations
this maximum size is user tunable by altering the SHMSIZE parameter in the
kernel configuration procedure."
/*
** Parameters:
**      %0      amount in bytes of shared memory requested.
** Explanation:
**      Shared memory has been requested using the system V "shmget" interface.
**      This routine has returned "EINVAL" which can mean one of 2 things
**      (see "man shmget" for information specific to you're OS):
**
**              size is less than the system-imposed minimum or greater
**              than the system imposed maximum.
**
**              A shared memory identifier exists for key but
**              the size of the segment associ- ated with it is less
**              than size and size is not equal to zero.
**
**      The maximum size shared memory segment a system can provide is site
**      specific and is given by the system administrator defined value assigned
**      to SHMSIZE (in 1k units).  This value usually is defaulted to 1024,
**      which sets an upper limit of 1 megabyte for a single shared memory
**      buffer.  This means that under a system configured with the defaults
**      one may not start up a dbms server using a shared buffer cache bigger
**      than 512 ingres pages:
**
**              512 ingres pages * 2048 bytes/ingres page = 1meg.
**
**      The value of SHMSIZE should be set to at least twice the number of
**      ingres pages that you wish to start up a dbms server with.  For instance
**      if you want to start up an ingres server with a 1024 page ingres cache
**      you should rebuild the kernel with SHMSIZE set to 2048 (actually you
**      should set it slightly higher since there is some amount of overhead
**      used by the dmf cache.)
**
** System Status:
**      Server will not start up.
** User Action:
**      Either restart server with the dmf.cache_size set to less than 1/2 the
**      current value of SHMSIZE, or rebuild the kernel with SHMSIZE increased
**      enough to support the required size buffer cache.

** Parameters:
**      %0c     - database name
**      %1d     - Journal file sequence number
**      %2d     - Journal file block number
**
** Explanation:
**      An error was encountered in the routine which writes to
**      the journal file.  The specific operating system error
**      that created this condition should have been previously
**      logged.
**
**      This error is usually caused by the journal file filling up.
**
** System Status:
**      The DMFACP will fail, which, if not restarted, will eventually
**      cause the log file to fill.
**
** User Action:
**      Check error log for specific reason of failure.  If the cause
**      is the journal file filling up, the following sequence of
**      operations are suggested.
**
**      1) Disable journaling via alterdb -j <database>
**
**      2) Either free up space on the disk on which the journal resides, or
**      relocate the journal location either through the use of symbolic links
**      (UNIX), logical name reassignment (VMS), or if the system is down, by
**      the modification of the journal location through ACCESSDB
**
**      3) Checkpoint the database via "ckpdb +j" to reenable journaling.

/*
** Parameters:
**      none
** Explanation:
**      An error was encountered while converting the config file from 6.0
**      to 6.3 format.  This could be because of an IO error, the config
**      file could need to be extended and there is no disk space, the
**      server could have run out of memory, or there could be a format
**      error in the old config file.  There should be a previous error
**      message in the error log detailing exactly what went wrong.
**
**      This problem should only occur the first time a database that was
**      created by Ingres 6.0 is opened by Ingres 6.3. When this is done
**      the system automatically converts the 6.0 config file to 6.3 format.
**
** System Status:
**      The database will not be accessible by Ingres 6.3 until it can be
**      properly converted.
** User Action:
**      The problem must be resolved and the config file converted in order
**      to access the database with Ingres 6.3.  If all else fails, the database
**      can be unloaded, then reloaded with a new 6.3 database.

**
** System Status:

** Parameters:

** Explanation:
**	An error was encountered while converting a table from the 6.4
**	format or lower to the current version. There should be previous
**	errors in the error log describing in more detail what went wrong
**	and what table/index is affected.
**
**	This problem should only occur when converting a database to the
**	new version.
**
** System Status:
**	The status of the database depends on which table or index the
**	error occured on. If a DBMS catalog was affected then the database
**	will not accessible by the new version of Ingres until it can
**	be properly converted.  If a user table was affected then the
**	database should be available but further errors will occur on the
**	table with problems.
** User Action:
**	If a DBMS catalog was affected then the problem must be resolved
**	before the new version of Ingres can access the database. For all
**	other tables the user may be able to modify or reload the table.
**	Secondary indexes should be dropped and recreated.
**	If all else fails the database may be unloaded from the old version
**	and reloaded into the new Ingres version.

**
** Description:
**	This is an indication that a page checksum has failed.  Page checksum 
**	failures occur most often as a result of hardware failures, but 
**	may also occur as a result of a bug in the server.  
**
** System Status:
**	The transaction or statement which encountered this error is aborted.
**	The page is not read into cache.
**
** User Action:
**	First it should be determined if hardware problems are causing
**	the checksum errors logs (VMS "show device" or UNIX /usr/adm/messages).
**	If it appears that hardware problems are the cause, the 
**	errors will likely disappear when the problem is resolved.
**
**	If checksum problems persist, the only fully supported technique 
**	for resolving the problem is to ROLLFORWARD the database.  
**
**	Unsupported trace points are available to disable
**	checksumming, and to report checksum errors to II_DBMS_LOG without 
**	having errors returned to the caller.  Use of these trace 
**	points is dangerous, however, as they effectively tell Ingres to
**	ignore bad data on a page.  Contact Tech Support for more 
**	information on trace points and related actions.
**
**	There is a small chance that checksum errors may occur as a result
**	of a bug in the server.  In it appears that this is the case, the user 
**	should save all relevant information, including system console
**	information, and report the problem to Tech Support.

** Explanation:
**      Buffer manager's internal count of the number of servers connected to
**      it does not match the number of holders of the buffer manager lock.
**      This probably indicates that a server exited abnormally without
**      decrementing the buffer manager connect count.  This message should

**      Server is shut down.  All other servers connected to this same buffer
**      manager will also be shut down automatically.
** User Action:
**      Restart servers - examine log to see reason why original server exited
**      abnormally.  This could have happened due to a server fatal error or
**      because the user stopped the dbms server process rather than shutting
**      it down normally.

** Explanation:
**      A bad row was encountered in the database that could not be

**
**      If the error is returned on an insert, then the bad row will not be

**      the bad row is probably already in the database.
** System Status:
**      Query will be rejected in normal case and the transaction aborted.
**      The error recovery actions can be altered by the trace flags below.
** User Action:
**      If this error is returned on a SELECT statement then there is probably
**      a bad row in the database.  The user should do a select by TID of the
**      reported row to make sure that it is really bad.  The table should be
**      recovered - methods for doing this are described below.
**
**      The supported method of fixing a table like this is to recover it from
**      the last checkpoint.  If this is not practical or possible, the table
**      can be patched by removing the offending row.  There are two trace
**      flags provided for this - these are undocumented trace flags that are
**      not intended to be distributed for general use!
**
**      SET TRACE POINT DM801 will cause DMF to skip bad rows like this when
**      scanning the table.  Thus the user could do
**
**              set trace point DM801
**              modify table to storage_structure
**
**      which would have the effect of rebuilding the table without any
**      of the offending rows.
**
**      SET TRACE POINT DM802 will cause DMF to return a garbage row when a
**      bad row is encountered.  This allows the user to do
**
**              set trace point DM802
**              delete table where table.tid = BAD_TID
**              set notrace point DM802
**
**      This will delete the offending row directly.  This is the only operation
**      that should be attempted while having this traceflag on as it may cause
**      unexpected and unpredictable results if used while SELECTing a bad row.

that does not coincide with the current logged operation.  Page LSN:
<%4d,%5d>, Log Record LSN <%6d,%7d>, Page Status %3x.  During Ingres Page 
Oriented Recovery the page being recovered must be in a state consistent
with the logged operation.  In Undo recovery, a page LSN which is less than 
the log record LSN implies that updates may have been lost or that Redo 
recovery did not properly restore the state of the database."
/*
** Parameters:
**	%0c		- table name
**	%1c		- table owner
**	%2d		- page number
**	%3x		- page status
**	%4d,%5d		- page LSN
**	%6d,%7d		- log record LSN
**
** Explanation:
**	During Ingres Page Oriented Recovery there is a dependence upon
**	pages being in exactly the state expected during Undo and Rollforward
**	recovery.
**
**	Page states are tracked by their LSNs.  An LSN is a unique log record
**	identifier and is usually equivalent to the Log Address of the record.
**	Whenever a page is updated, the LSN of the log record which describes
**	the update is written to the page.  The LSN therefore indicates the
**	the chronological state of the page.
**
**	A page with an LSN less than that of an associated log record is in a 
**	state PREVIOUS to when the logged update was applied.  That is to say
**	that the update HAS NOT been applied to the page.
**
**	A page with an LSN greater or equal to that of an associated log record
**	must have had the update applied to it.
**
**	During UNDO recovery the page LSN must be at least equal to that of
**	the log record LSN so that the update can be un-applied.  If it is
**	not, then updates to the page must have been lost and not restored
**	during REDO processing.
**
**	During Rollforward recovery, the page state is expected to always be
**	previous to the log records being applied.  If it is not, then the
**	database must not have been properly restored to a valid checkpoint.
**
** System Status:
**	During UNDO recovery, the operation will fail and the database may
**	be marked inconsistent. 
**
** User Action:
**      Check the error log for any related error messages that may give
**	a reason for the failure.  If possible save the iircp log, the 
**	Ingres error log and the output from a logdump operation to assist

"The Archiver detected a bad log address in the database configuration file."
/*%
** Parameters:

**
** Description:
**      This message is issued by the DMFACP process when it detects an internal
**      error. The Archiver keeps track of each database's archiving activity
**      in a special file known as the database configuration file (named
**      aaaaaaaa.cnf). In this file the Archiver stores the log address of the
**      last log record which was copied to the journals for this database.
**      Ingres log addresses are ever-increasing 8 byte integers, and the log
**      address which the archiver reads from the configuration file should
**      never exceed the log address in the current log file. If it does, the
**      Archiver issues this message and stops processing.
**
**      The most likely reason for encountering this error is that the log
**      file was re-initialized and the system time was erroneous, resulting
**      in log file addresses which were not ever-increasing.
**
** System Status:
**      The archiver stops processing. Detailed information is logged in the
**      Archiver's internal log file (II_ACP.LOG) about the database which
**      encountered this error, and the log address which was erroneous.
**
** User Action:
**      Run 'infodb' for this database and note the values which infodb
**      displays for the last log address journalled for this database. If this
**      is a VAX/VMS Cluster installation, also note the last log address
**      information for each cluster node. Next, run 'logstat' and note the
**      current log file EOF position. Observe that the last log address value
**      exceeds the current EOF.
**
**      Now contact Ingres Technical Support and report this problem. You will
**      be given advice on how to repair the problem (Internal note: the best
**      recovery action is probably to patch the jnl_la or cnode_la in the
**      config file back down to the current EOF, then to IMMEDIATELY take
**      a checkpoint of the database).

**
** Description:
**      Archiver could not allocate a resource necessary for processing.

**      Types of resource failure are:
**
**          Logging - Could not start transaction for archive processing.
**                    Logging system configuration should be altered to
**                    increase maximum number of concurrent transactions.

**                    Locking system configuration should be altered to
**                    increase the number of lock lists.
**          Memory  - Could not allocate memory for archive processing.
**                    This may be due to process quotas or actual system
**                    resources.  On VMS systems, quotas on the ACP should
**                    be examined to determine if they can be increased
**                    (See the Ingres utility script RUN_ACP.COM).  If

** Description:
**      The archiver encountered an internal error that prevents further

**      be reported as such to Ingres Technical Support.
**
**      The Archiver Log File (II_ACP.LOG) should be saved and if possible,

**
**      Hopefully, the archiver can be started up via the iiarchive command

"Archive processing cannot continue due to the inability to write dump
records during an Online Checkpoint operation on database %0c to the

the dump file.  Please check for disk space and the ability to create/write
files in the above dump directory.  The Archiver Log (II_ACP.LOG) will

**
** Description:
**      Archiver could not write log records for indicated database
**      to the dump files.  This is probably due to lack of disk

**
**      This error will be given on any write failure to the dump file
**      due to the inability on some systems to distinguish between a
**      write failure and an allocate failure, but most occurrences of
**      this error will occur during space allocation operations.

"Server has exited abnormally while connected to a Shared Cache causing an

/*
** Parameters:
**      None
** Explanation:
**      The Buffer Manager keeps an internal count of the number of servers
**      which are connected to it.  When servers start up or shut down, they
**      are expected to increment/decrement this count accordingly.
**
**      Each server connected to a buffer manager holds a shared buffer manager
**      lock on its server lock list.  At strategic times (server startup and
**      at consistency points) servers will check the number of holders
**      of the buffer manager lock and compare it with the connect count.
**      If the counts do not match then some server has exited without adjusting
**      the connect count.
**
**      This is currently considered a fatal error as the buffer manager is
**      left in an unpredictable state - lists may be trashed and data may
**      be corrupt.
**
**      When this message is displayed, it means that DMF is shutting down the
**      server.
**
** System Status:
**      Server is shut down.  All other servers connected to this same buffer
**      manager will also be shut down automatically.
** User Action:
**      Restart servers - examine log to see reason why original server exited
**      abnormally.  This could have happened due to a server fatal error or
**      because the user stopped the dbms server process rather than shutting
**      it down normally.

**      05-Feb-90 (seiwald)
**          Made GC0101 like GC0125, and added advice about checking II_CONFIG.
**          New E_GC2219_GCA_REGISTER_FAIL.
**      06-Feb-90 (seiwald)
**          New E_GC2815_NTWK_OPEN.

**          Added some words to the E_GC0137, 138, and 139 error messages

**  	    Try to make use of "association" and "connection" a little

**	29-Jan-93 (brucek)
**	    Added E_GC0040_CS_OK;
**	16-feb-1993 (dianeh)
**	    Added NO_SQLSTATE_MAPPING to end of file.
**	08-Mar-93 (seiwald)
**	    Cleared up the text of E_GC003C_PWPROMPT_NOTSUP a bit.
**	7-apr-93 (robf)
**	    Added Secure 2.0 error messages:

**	    E_GC0042_AGENT_MISSING_REMOTE
**	    E_GC0043_AGENT_PARTNER_NOTSUP
**	    E_GC221A_AL_SECLABEL_TYPE 
**	3-oct-94 (angusm)
**	    Changed text of E_GC000B and E_GC0140, since they are also

**
** Description:
**      This message is logged when an internal error occurs in the scc_error()
**      call. The scc_error() function is used to send error messages to the
**      user, so this indicates that the internal error developed during the

**      error message in question was NOT sent to the user.
**
**      Error messages in the immediate vicinity of this message in the error
**      log may provide additional details about the operation which was in
**      progress when the error occurred. This information may be helpful to
**      Ingres Technical Support.
**
** System Status:
**      The current query is aborted, and message E_SC0206 is (ususally) given

**      to this message may have been logged in the error log.
**
** User Action:
**      Inform your Ingres Administrator, who should contact Ingres Technical

/*%
** Parameters:
**      None
**
** Description:
**      This error message is used by GWF to pass back to DMF the fact that
**      a data conversion error occurred in the gateway. The data conversion
**      error was handled by taking the following actions:
**
**          1) Reporting a low-level, conversion-specific error message to the
**             user through a direct call to scc_error().
**          2) Aborting the processing of the record which was being accessed.
**          3) Returning without logging any error message text to the errlog.
**
**      This error message indicates to DMF that no further work should be
**      performed on this query; the query should be aborted. However, no
**      error messages need be logged to the error log -- this is a "user"
**      error, not an "internal" error, and needs no traceback.
**
** System Status:
**      The current query will be aborted, if possible (not all gateways can
**      abort queries). A 'friendly' error message has already been sent to
**      the user. No subsequent error messages need to be sent or logged for
**      this error.
**
** User Action:
**      Determine what caused the data conversion error and correct it. Then
**      re-execute the query. If possible, the gateway has aborted the query
**      and backed out the operations it performed; however, not all gateways
**      support aborting of query operations, so some work may have already
**      been performed by this query.

**      and query cleanup and recovery should be performed normally.

** System Status:
**      The query will be aborted, but all other processing continues normally.

** Parameters:

** Description:
**      E_GW5484 is used to indicate a recoverable data conversion error within

**      or from Ingres to RMS; either type of conversion can produce this error.
**
**      The user does not see this error, nor is it logged to the error log. It
**      exists internally so that callers of the RMS exits can determine whether
**      an error which occurred was a data conversion error or an unexpected
**      internal error, and can modify their behavior accordingly.
**
**      Typically, this error should be remapped to a generic GWF error message
**      by the GWF layer.

/*
** Parameters:
**      %0  Estimated units of CPU resource required to execute the query.
**      %1  CPU resource limit established for this session.
**
** Explanation:
**      Each user may be constrained by resource limits established by the
**      DBA or System Administrator. The limits may be individually
**      established for each database via the GRANT statement.
**      Each query that is executed contains an estimate of the resources
**      required to execute the query. If the estimate for a query exceeds
**      the resource limit established for the current session, the query
**      request is rejected. In this case, the estimate of CPU resources
**      exceeded the limit for this session. Note that CPU resources are
**      estimated in normalized units and provide only a relative measure
**      of the cpu time required to execute a query. The estimates do not
**      correspond to the actual cpu time used on a specific processor.
**
**  System Status:
**      The query is aborted with a fatal error.
**
**  User Action:
**      1. Attempt to run a variant of the query that will use fewer
**         resources. This may be possible by adding additional qualifications
**         to the query or by further restricting the range of values in
**         current qualifications.
**
**      2. Determine if the database is properly organized for efficient
**         execution of the query under consideration. If this is a common
**         query it may be advisable to change the storage structures or
**         index structures on the tables involved.

"Query exceeds the limit (%0d) for cascading rules and nested database
procedures.  The query is aborted with a fatal error."
/*
**  Parameters:
**      %0  Maximum nesting level for database procedures.
**
**  Explanation:
**      This error will occur when executing queries that trigger rule
**      processing. The rule processing may be such that a query triggers
**      a rule, a query within that rule triggers another rule, and so on.
**      Each such nested rule firing causes the execution of the database
**      procedure associated with the rule to be stacked and the database
**      procedure invoked by the newly triggered rule to begin execution.
**      The maximum depth of such nesting is constrained by an internal
**      system parameter. The current query has triggered rule execution
**      that has cascaded beyond the maximum depth allowed.

**  System Status:
**      The original query triggering rule execution is aborted with a
**      fatal error. All queries run by the database procedures invoked
**      by rule processing are rolled back.
**
**  User Action:
**
**      The following are possible causes of this error:
**
**          1. The collection of rules defined in the database establishes
**             dependencies between more tables than are supported by the
**             system. Both the database design and the set of rules defined
**             should be inspected and changed to limit the dependencies
**             between tables.
**
**          2. Circular dependencies may be defined that will cause rules
**             to cascade indefinitely. Inspect the set of rules defined
**             and modify one or more rules in the offending rule set.

on some queries using synonyms.\n

configured RDF.  The server will still find correct answers, but may\n
take longer to do so."
/*%
** Parameters:
**      none.
** Explanation:
**      RDF accepts startup parameters from iirundbms command file (located
**      in the utility subdirectory of ingres
**        ($II_SYSTEM/ingres/utility/iirundbms on unix and
**         ii_system:[ingres.utility]iirundbms.com_<node_name> on VMS)
**      One of those parameters, max_tbls, indicates the max number of tables
**      RDF may have on its cache (the default is 300).  Another parameter,
**      tbl_synonyms, tells how many synonyms may be defined for each table (the
**      default is 1).
**
**      You may have your system configured reasonably, but alot of concurrent
**      activity is keeping RDF memory usage too high to add another synonym to
**      RDF's memory cache.  Or, you system may not be configured correctly for
**      RDF.
**
**      In either case, you can improve the situation by increasing the
**      number of synonyms permitted per table:
**
**          \RDF=(max_tbls=xxxx, tbl_synonyms=xxxx)
**
**      where xxxx is a large number than the current (if specified) or
**      default (if not specified) values.  The tradeoff is that the dbms server
**      will use more memory when you increase these values.
**
** System Status:
**      The statement continues running, but will be a bit slower, because the
**      server will have to go to disk next time it needs this information
**      instead of getting it from memory.
** User Action:
**      user may reconfigure RDF startup parameters and restart server.
