**  Name: ADCKEYBLD.C - Build a HASH, ISAM or BTREE key for a data value.
**
**  Description:
**      This file contains all of the routines necessary to
**      perform the  external ADF call "adc_keybld()" which
**      builds a HASH, ISAM or BTREE key from the supplied data value.
**
**      This file defines the following externally visible routine:
**
**          adc_keybld() - Build a HASH, ISAM or BTREE key for a data value.
**
**
**  History:
**      25-feb-86 (thurston)
**          Initial creation.
**      27-jul-86 (ericj)
**	    Converted for new ADF error handling.
**	14-nov-86 (thurston)
**	    Made adc_keybld() work for the LIKE operator.
**	02-dec-86 (thurston)
**	    Added the ad0_keycvt() static routine to avoid having to create
**	    a large buffer on stack for every call to adc_keybld().  Now this
**	    buffer will only be created if actually needed.
**	13-jan-87 (thurston)
**	    Added special case code to adc_keybld() to handle the .db_data PTR
**	    in the input key value being NULL.  This can occurr for user
**	    parameters in repeat queries, and this routine should just fill in
**	    the type of key to be built to what is "probably" going to be built.
**	19-feb-87 (thurston)
**	    Reversed all STRUCT_ASSIGN_MACRO's to conform to CL spec.
**	22-feb-87 (thurston)
**	    Added support for nullable datatypes.  Also, fixed bug in
**	    ad0_keycvt() that could have caused big problem:  coercion was
**	    being placed in the temp's low-key field, not the input value field.
**	    Therefore, when the low level keybld routine was being called, it
**	    would assume that the types were the same, but they wouldn't be.
**	    In effect, this bug was making it appear that the coercion was
**	    never taking place.
**	26-feb-87 (thurston)
**	    Made changes to use server CB instead of GLOBALDEFs.
**	26-mar-87 (thurston)
**	    Added code to prevent the lo and hi keys' data are from being
**	    written if their .db_data ptr is NULL.
**	19-apr-87 (thurston)
**	    Added a FIX_ME jury rig to allow OPF to call adc_keybld() with
**	    the `not like' and `!=' operators; they will always return
**	    ADC_KALLMATCH.
**	18-jun-87 (thurston)
**	    Altered adc_keybld() so that the low and high key values are ALWAYS
**	    set, regardless of the type of key built, unless overridden by a
**	    NULL .db_data pointer.
**	20-jul-87 (thurston)
**	    No longer call ad0_keycvt() if datatypes are different, but are both
**	    string types.  Assume that low level key builder can handle this.
**	20-jul-87 (thurston)
**	    Changed ad0_keycvt() from returning an error when a coercion cannot
**          be done without error, to returning an ALLMATCH.  This covers
**          complex cases such as `i = c' which yields money comparisons.  No
**          real good easy way to detect these situations and do the proper
**          keying, so better to force a full scan. 
**	31-jul-87 (thurston)
**	    Got rid of static routine ad0_keycvt() since new versions of the
**	    low level key building routines can accept input datatypes that are
**	    different from the key to be built.
**	25-aug-87 (thurston)
**	    Fixed a bug that would cause adc_keybld() to access violate when it
**	    attempted to do an ADF_CLR_NULL_MACRO() on a DB_DATA_VALUE whose
**	    .db_data ptr was NULL.  This would only happen if the datatype to
**	    build the key for was nullable, and either the pattern's datatype
**          and length did not match that of the key, OR pattern matching
**          characters could exist for that datatype. 
**	19-oct-87 (thurston)
**	    A bug was found where adc_keybld() would access violate if the type
**	    of key built was ADC_KEXACTKEY, and the low value had a data ptr of
**	    NULL while the high value's data ptr was non-NULL.  This was fixed
**	    by recursively calling the adc_keybld() routine when detected with
**	    exchanging the low and high data ptrs.  (Currently, this will never
**	    occur in the DBMS since keybld is never called in this way but,
**	    "ya neva no."
**	04-feb-88 (thurston)
**	    Had to revert to old special short-cut for a NULL .db_data ptr for
**	    now.  This should eventually be moved down into the lower level key
**	    builders, since only they TRULY know what to return.
**	02-jun-88 (thurston)
**	    Added comments to the input parameters for the new .adc_escape and
**	    .adc_isescape fields in the ADC_KEY_BLK.
**	10-oct-88 (thurston)
**	    Quick patch in adc_keybld() for case where there is no data pointer
**	    for the constant (or pattern, or input, or whatever you want to
**	    call it).  When the constant datatype is C and the column is some
**	    other datatype, then we should return ALLMATCH here.
**	20-mar-89 (jrb)
**	    Made changes for adc_lenchk interface change.
**	10-apr-89 (mikem)
**	    Logical key development.  Added support for DB_LOGKEY_TYPE and
**	    DB_TABKEY_TYPE.  These types do not support pattern matching.
**	28-apr-89 (fred)
**	    Altered to use ADI_DT_MAP_MACRO().
**	05-jun-89 (fred)
**	    Completed above fix.
**	21-may-90 (jrb)
**	    Changed case where no key data were provided and the key type was
**	    abstract and different from the column's type; fixes bug #21291.
**	27-aug-92 (stevet)
**	    Fixed B45057 and B45510.  The return key types for CHARACTER keys
**	    when input type is INTEGER or FLOAT are inconsistence
**	    between optimization phase and execution phase of the QP.
**	    The problem is in these two situations, data values are not
**	    available during optimization, which cause a different key
**	    type being return.  The fix is to change the return key
**	    type to be the same with or without given data value.
**      22-dec-1992 (stevet)
**          Added function prototype.
**      14-jun-1993 (stevet)
**          Introduced the support for NULLABLE key join (B40762).  For
**          nullable join (ADI_NULJN_OP) we look at whether the input
**          value is NULL, if not, then we simply handle ADI_NULJN_OP
**          like ADI_EQ_OP.
**	14-jul-93 (ed)

**	25-aug-93 (ed)

/*{
** Name: adc_keybld()	- Build a HASH, ISAM or BTREE key for a data value.
**
** Description:
**      This function is the external ADF call "adc_keybld()" which builds a
**      HASH, ISAM or BTREE key from the supplied data value. 
**
**      This operation will be used by OPF for building keys for traversing
**      HASH, ISAM and BTREE indexes.  It is a complex operation which requires
**      some explanation.  Whenever the INGRES DBMS has a value, and decides to
**      look up that value in a table using an ordered index (either HASH, ISAM
**      or B-TREE), it will use that value to form two other values.  These
**	two values will represent the "key", or more clearly, the lower and
**	upper limits of the search space.  It is *NOT* guaranteed that all
**	values between these two will match, but it *IS* guaranteed that all
**	values in the relation that match will be between the lower and upper
**	limits produced by adc_keybld().
**
**      Along with the value being keyed on, the caller of this routine needs to
**      specify, the comparison operator being used (e.g. `<', `>=', `like',
**	`is null'). 
**
**	The main job of this routine is to build the upper and lower values
**      of the search space (called the `high key' and `low key', respectively).
**      The building of the high and/or low key can be omitted, however, by
**	supplying the .db_data pointer for it/them as NULL.  This might be used
**	if the caller is only interested in finding out what `type of key' gets
**	built in this situation, but is not interested in the search space.
**
**      In addition to building the upper and lower values of the search space,
**      adc_keybld() returns the `type of key' that was formed.  This tells what
**	type of search should be performed. 
**
**                            **********************
**                            **  IMPORTANT NOTE  **
**      *********************************************************************
**      **  There is an implied ordering for the defined key type values.  **
**      **     If this ordering is changed, the optimizer will break.      **
**      *********************************************************************
**
**      The different key types for the Jupiter version of the INGRES DBMS are: 
**
**	Key Type	Meaning					    Ordering
**	-------------	----------------------------------------    --------
**	ADC_KNOMATCH	None of the values in the relation can		<
**                      possibly match, so no scan of the
**                      relation should be done.  In this case,
**                      the low key will be set to the max value
**                      for the datatype/length of the column
**                      being keyed, and the high key will be
**                      set to the min.
**	ADC_KEXACTKEY	Only a single value from the relation		<
**                      will match.  In this case, the low and
**                      high key will be set to the same value.
**                      The execution phase should seek to this
**                      point and scan forward until it is sure
**                      that it has exhausted all possible
**                      matching values.
**	ADC_KRANGEKEY	All values in the relation that will		<
**                      match lay within a range.  The low key
**                      will be set to represent the lowest
**                      value in the relation that can possibly
**                      be matched, while the high key will be
**                      set to represent the highest value that
**                      can be matched.  The execution phase
**                      should seek to the point matching the
**                      low key, then scan forward until it has
**                      exhausted all values that might be less
**                      than or equal to the high key. 
**	ADC_KHIGHKEY	All values in the relation that will		<
**                      match lay at the low end of the
**                      relation; they are less than or equal to
**                      some value.  In this case, the high key
**                      is set to that value (the upper bound),
**                      and the low key is set to the min value
**                      for the datatype/length of the columned
**                      being keyed (unbounded). The execution
**                      phase should start at the beginning of
**                      the relation and seek forward until it
**                      has exhausted all values that might be
**                      less than or equal to the high key. 
**	ADC_KLOWKEY	All values in the relation that will		<
**                      match lay at the high end of the
**                      relation; they are greater than or equal
**                      to some value.  In this case, the low
**                      key is set to that value (the lower
**                      bound), and the high key is set to the
**                      max value for the datatype/length of the
**                      columned being keyed (unbounded).  The
**                      execution phase should seek to the point
**                      of the low key and scan forward from
**                      there. 
**	ADC_KNOKEY	The boolean expression was too complex for    <
**                      the optimizer to use.  NOTE, THIS VALUE IS
**                      NEVER RETURNED BY THIS ROUTINE, BUT IS
**                      USED INTERNALLY BY THE OPTIMIZER. 
**	ADC_KALLMATCH	All values in the relation may match.
**                      In this case, the low key is set to the
**                      min value for the datatype/length of the
**                      column being keyed, and the high key is
**                      set to the max.  A full scan of the
**                      relation should be done. 
**
**
**	*** A SPECIAL CASE ***
**	    --------------
**		When this routine is called with the input value's .db_data
**		pointer being NULL, then adc_keybld() merely returns the "worst
**		case" key type that would be returned, ignoring the possibility
**		of pattern matching.  The optimizer uses this information in
**		figuring the best query plan to build when it does not have the
**		actual data.  This can happen in repeat queries, as well as in
**		function keys (i.e.  where the value used to key into the
**		relation is the result of some function).
**
**
**      Although there is a fairly strong correlation between the key operator
**      and the type of key that gets built, one cannot predict with certainty
**      the type of key that will be built based on the key operator.  As an
**      example, take the case where we are keying on an i2 column with the `<'
**      operator. However, our supplied key value is an i4 whose value is 50000.
**      The key that gets built here is ADC_KALLMATCH, not ADC_KHIGHKEY, as you
**      may have expected.  Therefore, DO NOT RELY ON THE KEY OPERATOR TO TELL
**      YOU WHAT TYPE OF KEY WILL BE BUILT! 
**
** Inputs:
**	adf_scb				Pointer to an ADF session control block.
**	    .adf_errcb			ADF_ERROR struct.
**		.ad_ebuflen		The length, in bytes, of the buffer
**					pointed to by ad_errmsgp.
**		.ad_errmsgp		Pointer to a buffer to put formatted
**					error message in, if necessary.
**	adc_kblk			Ptr to an ADC_KEY_BLK.
**	    .adc_kdv			The DB_DATA_VALUE to form a key for.
**		.db_datatype		Datatype of data value.
**		.db_prec		Precision/Scale of data value
**		.db_length		Length of data value.
**		.db_data		Pointer to the actual data.
**					If this is NULL (which can happen
**					for user parameters in repeat queries),
**					then this routine simply fills in the
**					.adc_tykey field with what would
**					"probably" be built.
**	    .adc_opkey			Key operator used to tell this
**					routine what kind of comparison
**					operation the key is to be
**					built for, as described above.
**					NOTE: ADI_OP_IDs should not be used
**					directly.  Rather the caller should
**					use the adi_opid() routine to obtain
**					the value that should be passed in here.
**          .adc_lokey			DB_DATA_VALUE to recieve the low key.
**					Note, its datatype and length should
**					be the same as .adc_hikey's datatype
**					and length.
**		.db_datatype		Datatype for low key.
**		.db_prec		Precision/Scale for low key
**	    	.db_length		Length for low key (i.e. how
**					much space is reserved for the
**					data portion).
**		.db_data		Pointer to location to put the
**					actual data of the low key.  (If this
**					is NULL, the low key will not be set.)
**	    .adc_hikey			DB_DATA_VALUE to recieve the high key.
**					Note, its datatype and length should
**					be the same as .adc_lokey's datatype 
**					and length.
**		.db_datatype		Datatype for high key.
**		.db_prec		Precision/Scale for high key
**		.db_length		Length for high key (i.e. how
**					much space is reserved for the
**					data portion).
**		.db_data		Pointer to location to put the
**					actual data of the high key.  (If this
**					is NULL, the low key will not be set.)
**	    .adc_escape			*** USED ONLY FOR THE `LIKE' familiy
**					of operators, and then only if
**					.adc_pat_flags AD_PAT_HAS_ESCAPE bit set
**					The escape char to use, if there was an
**					ESCAPE clause with the LIKE or NOT LIKE
**					predicate.
**	    .adc_pat_flags		*** USED ONLY FOR THE `LIKE' family
**					of operators ***
**					If there was an ESCAPE clause with the
**					LIKE or NOT LIKE predicate, then supply
**					.adc_pat_flags with AD_PAT_HAS_ESCAPE set,
**					and set .adc_escape to the escape char.
**					If there is not an ESCAPE clause with the
**					LIKE or NOT LIKE predicate, then this bit
**					must cleared. It is a good idea to set the
**					whole of .adc_pat_flags to 0 for other
**					operators that are not of the LIKE family.
**
** Outputs:
**	adf_scb				Pointer to an ADF session control block.
**	    .adf_errcb			ADF_ERROR struct.  If an
**					error occurs the following fields will
**					be set.  NOTE: if .ad_ebuflen = 0 or
**					.ad_errmsgp = NULL, no error message
**					will be formatted.
**		.ad_errcode		ADF error code for the error.
**		.ad_errclass		Signifies the ADF error class.
**		.ad_usererr		If .ad_errclass is ADF_USER_ERROR,
**					this field is set to the corresponding
**					user error which will either map to
**					an ADF error code or a user-error code.
**		.ad_emsglen		The length, in bytes, of the resulting
**					formatted error message.
**		.adf_errmsgp		Pointer to the formatted error message.
**      adc_kblk			Ptr to an ADC_KEY_BLK.
**	    .adc_tykey			The type of key which was built,
**                                      as described above.  This will
**					be one of the following:
**						ADC_KNOMATCH
**						ADC_KEXACTKEY
**						ADC_KRANGEKEY
**						ADC_KHIGHKEY
**						ADC_KLOWKEY
**						ADC_KALLMATCH
**	    .adc_lokey
**		.db_data		If this ptr is not NULL, then the
**					actual data for it will be put at
**					this location.
**          .adc_hikey
**		.db_data		If this ptr is not NULL, then the
**					actual data for it will be put at
**					this location.
**
**      Returns:
**	      The following DB_STATUS codes may be returned:
**	    E_DB_OK, E_DB_WARN, E_DB_ERROR, E_DB_SEVERE, E_DB_FATAL
**
**	      If a DB_STATUS code other than E_DB_OK is returned, the caller
**	    can look in the field adf_scb.adf_errcb.ad_errcode to determine
**	    the ADF error code.  The following is a list of possible ADF error
**	    codes that can be returned by this routine:
**
**          E_AD0000_OK			Operation succeeded.
**          E_AD2004_BAD_DTID		Datatype unknown to ADF.
**          E_AD3002_BAD_KEYOP		Key operator unknown to ADF.
**
**	    NOTE:			The following error numbers are internal
**					consistency checks that will only be
**					generated when the system is compiled
**					with the xDEBUG flag.
**
**          E_AD2005_BAD_DTLEN		Internal length is illegal for
**					the given datatype.
**          E_AD3001_DTS_NOT_SAME	The datatypes of the key DB_DATA_VALUEs
**					are not the same.
**          E_AD3003_DLS_NOT_SAME	The length specifications for the key
**					results, adc_hikey and adc_lokey, were
**					not the same.
**
**      Exceptions:
**          none
**
** Side Effects:
**          none
**
** History:
**      25-feb-86 (thurston)
**          Initial creation.
**	06-jun-86 (ericj)
**	    Changed specification.
**      27-jul-86 (ericj)
**	    Converted for new ADF error handling.
**	14-nov-86 (thurston)
**	    Made work for the LIKE operator.
**	02-dec-86 (thurston)
**	    Added the ad0_keycvt() static routine to avoid having to create
**	    a large buffer on stack for every call to adc_keybld().  Now this
**	    buffer will only be created if actually needed.
**	13-jan-87 (thurston)
**	    Added special case code to handle the .db_data PTR in the input
**	    key value being NULL.  This can occurr for user parameters in
**	    repeat queries, and this routine should just fill in the type of
**	    key to be built to what is "probably" going to be built.
**	22-feb-87 (thurston)
**	    Added support for nullable datatypes.
**	26-mar-87 (thurston)
**	    Added code to prevent the lo and hi keys' data are from being
**	    written if their .db_data ptr is NULL.
**	19-apr-87 (thurston)
**	    Added a FIX_ME jury rig to allow OPF to call this routine with
**	    the `not like' and `!=' operators; they will always return
**	    ADC_KALLMATCH.
**	18-jun-87 (thurston)
**	    Altered this routine so that the low and high key values are ALWAYS
**	    set, regardless of the type of key built, unless overridden by a
**	    NULL .db_data pointer.
**	25-aug-87 (thurston)
**	    Fixed a bug that would cause adc_keybld() to access violate when it
**	    attempted to do an ADF_CLR_NULL_MACRO() on a DB_DATA_VALUE whose
**	    .db_data ptr was NULL.  This would only happen if the datatype to
**	    build the key for was nullable, and either the pattern's datatype
**          and length did not match that of the key, OR pattern matching
**          characters could exist for that datatype. 
**	19-oct-87 (thurston)
**	    A bug was found where access violation would occur if the type of
**	    key built was ADC_KEXACTKEY, and the low value had a data ptr of
**	    NULL while the high value's data ptr was non-NULL.  This was fixed
**	    by recursively calling the adc_keybld() routine when detected with
**	    exchanging the low and high data ptrs.  (Currently, this will never
**	    occur in the DBMS since keybld is never called in this way but,
**	    "ya neva no.")
**	04-feb-88 (thurston)
**	    Had to revert to old special short-cut for a NULL .db_data ptr for
**	    now.  This should eventually be moved down into the lower level key
**	    builders, since only they TRULY know what to return.
**	02-jun-88 (thurston)
**	    Added comments to the input parameters for the new .adc_escape and
**	    .adc_isescape fields in the ADC_KEY_BLK.  No actual source change
**	    needs to happen in this file ... the low level key building routine
**	    for character strings will have to deal with it.
**	10-oct-88 (thurston)
**	    Quick patch for case where there is no data pointer for the constant
**	    (or pattern, or input, or whatever you want to call it).  When the
**	    constant datatype is C and the column is some other datatype, then
**	    we should return ALLMATCH here.
**	10-apr-89 (mikem)
**	    Logical key development.  Added support for DB_LOGKEY_TYPE and
**	    DB_TABKEY_TYPE.  These types do not support pattern matching.
**	07-jul-89 (jrb)
**	    Added decimal, money, and date to the list of datatypes which do
**	    not have pattern matching.  Also added code to make sure short-cuts
**	    are not taken on DECIMAL unless precision matches as well as length.
**	21-may-90 (jrb)
**	    Changed case where no key data were provided and the key type was
**	    abstract and different from the column's type; this case now returns
**	    "all match" for reasons explained in comments below.
**	27-aug-92 (stevet)
**	    Fixed B45057 and B45510.  Changed the return key type to
**	    ADC_KALLMATCH when input datatype is INTEGER or FLOAT and
**	    the output type is CHARACTER and the data value is not given.
**      14-jun-1993 (stevet)
**          Introduced the support for NULLABLE key join (B40762).  For
**          nullable join (ADI_NULJN_OP) we look at whether the input
**          value is NULL, if not, then we simply handle ADI_NULJN_OP
**          like ADI_EQ_OP.
**	10-jan-94 (rickh)
**	    When building a key for a nulljoin, we weren't filling in a
**	    key type under some circumstances.
**	11-sep-96 (inkdo01)
**	    Changes to build a key for "<>" (ne) operator, for better
**	    OPF selectivity estimates.
**	27-jan-2000 (hayke02)
**	    We now do not call adc_ixopt() if we are executing a DBP
**	    (AD_1RSVD_EXEDBP set in the ADI_WARN block). This prevents
**	    incorrect results when a DBP parameter is used in multiple
**	    predicates. This change fixes bug 99239.
**      19-nov-2008 (huazh01)
**          Back out the fix to b99239, which can't be reproduced
**          after 2.x code line. This allows the 'ad_1rsvd_cnt'
**          field to be removed from ADI_WARN structure. (b121246).
**	27-Mar-2009 (kiria01) b121841
**	    Move NULL buffer logic substantially into the datatype
**	    specific code so that datatype specific checks can be
**	    made even in the absence of a buffer.
**	    Preload the adc_tykey so callee need not worry about
**	    default settings.
**	    NOTE: This routine is often called three or more
**	    times for a given qualifier and each need to return
**	    the same decision regarding key type. Thus before when
**	    the first of the calls might not have had a key buffer
**	    the result was short-circuited by generic code regardless
**	    of whether offered datatypes scould yield no key. In the
**	    worst arrangement, a btree lookup might be prepared but a
**	    full scan needed with inappropriate datatypes present.
**	    This decision is now pushed down to the datatype specific
**	    routines.
**      10-Feb-2011 (hanal04) Bug 125013
**          Add handling for IS TRUE, IS FALSE, IS NOT TRUE and IS NOT FALSE. 
**      11-Feb-2011 (hanal04) Bug 125013
**          Add datatype checking to previous change. Also correct the key
**          build for NOT TRUE, NOT FALSE to ensure nulls are correctly
**          selected.

/*{
** Name: adc_ixopt      - fiddles low/high values of GT/LT keys to improve index 
**			  access
**
** Description:
**	Simply checks for alterable data type (currently int's, char, varchar
**      and money) and changes GT comparison to GE on the next value for that
**      data type (e.g. > 25 is set to >= 26) and analogously for LT
**	comparisons. This avoids a DMF scan of potentially large numbers of
**	rows at the > or < constant, even though they'll be filtered out
**	in QEF.
**
** Inputs:
**	adc_kblk		key control block
**	ky_bdt			normalized (un-nulled) datatype
**	ky_blen			normalized constant length
**
** Outputs:
**	adc_kblk		constant changed, as well as adc_opkey (if 
**				optimization was possible)
**
** History:
**	26-sep-95 (inkdo01)
**		Written.
**	30-oct-97 (inkdo01)
**	    Add TEXT as synonymous with VARCHAR.
**	26-apr-00 (inkdo01)
**	    Change GE to LE (undiscovered bug from earlier range predicate
**	    optimization).
**	12-may-04 (inkdo01)
**	    Added support for bigint.
