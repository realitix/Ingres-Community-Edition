/*{
** Name: adc_xform	- Transform Periph Dt from one style to another.
**
** Description:
**      This routine is the generic entry point to ADF for transforming a
**	peripheral datatype into another style.  Peripheral
**	datatypes are stored as a list of segments of a datatype specific
**	non-peripheral (normal) datatype.  These styles exist to allow
**      the representation of peripheral datatypes suitable for a
**      variety of different purposes.
**
**  	The styles used are as follows:
**          GCA - (with/out length known up front).  These styles are
**             used to transmit and receive data from front ends.
**             These both have a standard large object header,
**             followed by a sequence of segments each of which is
**             preceded by an int (i4) which is non-zero if the
**             following segment is present.  Thus, these look like
**               <3 i4 header>
**               {<int: value 1> <segment>}...
**               <int: 0>
**             The {} enclosed line may be repeated, or, for a null or
**             zero length object, will be absent.
**
**          COUPON -- These are a sequence of segments of the
**             underlying type.  No segment indicator is present.
**
**          DATA -- This is just a raw byte stream.
**
**	If this routine returns a status of E_DB_INFO, with an error of
**	E_AD0002_INCOMPLETE, that indicates that the input to this routine has
**	been exhausted, and more is required.  The caller should materialize
**	this data using whatever means is appropriate, and call this routine
**	again.
**
**	E_DB_WARN/E_AD7001_ADP_NONEXT is returned when the last segment has
**	been processed.
**
** Inputs:
**      scb                             ADF Session control block.

** History:
**    30-Nov-1992 (fred)
**       Created.
**    6-Apr-1993 (fred)
**       Added long byte support.  This differs from long varchar only
**       in that with long byte, we don't have to (indeed should not)
**       do the double byte machinations that character strings
**       require. 
**    20-Oct-1993 (fred)
**    	 Removed debug code which kept segment count in l0 field.  It
**       tended to mess STAR up.  (Rightfully.)
**    24-Oct-2001 (thaju02)
**	 If the output buffer does not have enough space for the 
**	 2-byte segment length indicator, then we have to flush
**	 the buffer. Note buffer already contains the 4 byte
**	 "more segment/end-of-data" indicator, thus upon re-entering
**	 adu_redeem, make sure that we do not send out another
**	 "more segment/end-of-data" indicator. (B104122)	    	
**    16-Oct-2003 (stial01, gupsh01)
**	  Added ADW_C_HALF_DBL_FLOC to indicate if half
**	  a unicode value is set in adc_chars.
**    14-Dec-2005 (wanfr01)
**        Bug 115140, INGSRV3426
**        When appending the second byte of a double byte
**	  character to the buffer, remember to bump up the
**	  byte count by one.
**	24-May-2007 (gupsh01)
**	  Added support to store partial bytes for a multibyte
**	  character.
**    28-Aug-2007 (thaju02) 
**	 For long nvarchar, there needs to be  enough space in the 
**	 output buffer for 2-byte segment length and first nchar,
**	 otherwise flush buffer. Upon re-entering adu_redeem do not 
**	 output another "more segment/end-of-data" indicator. Extend 
**	 fix for bug 104122 to long nvarchar. (B119016)
**    01-Nov-2010 (thaju02) B124683
**	 For UTF8 and lvch, use MEcopy to move segment to result 
**	 buffer(chp).
