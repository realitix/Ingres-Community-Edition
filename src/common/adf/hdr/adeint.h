/**
** Name: ADEINT.H - Internal structures and constants needed for ADE.
**
** Description:
**      This file holds typedefs and constant definitions needed internally
**	by ADF's Compiled Expression Module, ADE.  Throughout the file you
**	will see "compiled expression" abbreviated as "CX".  This file depends
**	on <compat.h>, <dbms.h>, and <ade.h> already being #included.
**
** History: $Log-for RCS$
**	17-jun-86 (thurston)
**          Initial creation.
**	10-jul-86 (thurston)
**	    Changes to the ADE_INSTRUCTION typedef:  Removed the .ins_ops[1]
**          member, since some instructions will not have any operands, and this
**          would be misleading, as well as a little difficult to code around.
**          Also removed the .ins_rsvd member. 
**	16-jul-86 (thurston)
**	    Changed the ADE_CONSTANT typedef:  Made .con_rsvd an array to
**	    round structure up to 16 bytes.
**	21-jul-86 (thurston)
**	    Added the ADE_CXINPROGRESS constant.
**	18-nov-86 (thurston)
**	    Added some pre-compiler lines to assure that either ADE_BACKEND
**	    or ADE_FRONTEND (and not both) are defined.
**	25-mar-87 (thurston)
**	    In ADE_CXHEAD, I changed f4 cx_version to be i2's cx_hi_version and
**	    cx_lo_version.  Also tweaked the version constants.
**	06-may-87 (thurston & wong)
**	    Integrated FE changes.
**	13-may-87 (thurston)
**	    Added ADE_END_OFFSET_LIST.
**	14-may-87 (thurston)
**	    Increased max # VLT's in any CX (ADE_MXVLTS) from 25 to 100.
**	10-feb-88 (thurston)
**	    Used the reserved space at the end of the CX header struct for the
**	    new fields .cx_n_vi, .cx_vi_1st_offset, and .cx_fi_last_offset which
**	    are needed in support of the new VIRGIN segment.
**	05-apr-89 (jrb)
**	    Added opr_prec and opr_1rsvd to ADE_I_OPERAND for decimal project.
**	    Added con_prec to ADE_CONSTANT.
**	05-jan-98 (nicph02)
**	    Increased max # VLT's in any CX (ADE_MXVLTS) from 100 to 500.
**	    (bug 48794)
**      22-Nov-1999 (hweho01)
**          Changed opr_offset from int to long for avoiding the truncation  
**          of address, since pointer is 8-byte for 64-bit platforms.
**          
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	02-aug-2003 (somsa01)
**	    Updated opr_offset to be of type OFFSET_TYPE.
**	14-Feb-2005 (schka24)
**	    Additions for subroutine-threaded code (STCODE).
**	29-Aug-2005 (schka24)
**	    Add a couple more CX-segment flags.
**	04-Aug-2010 (kiria01) b124160
**	    Raised limit handling on vlts. Now we have a ADE_MXVLTS_SOFT
**	    upto which the stack will be used and beyond, the limit can
**	    get to ADE_MXVLTS which is the max supported in the CXHEAD.
**	    To handle this memory will be allocated temporarily to extend
**	    the workspace. Based on this the soft limit bas been lowered
**	    from what it was as it no longer needs to represent the hard
**	    limit.

** Name: ADE_I_OPERAND - Internal representation of a CX instruction's operand.
**
** Description:
**      This describes the internal structure (i.e. what is actually compiled
**      into the CX) of an operand for an instruction in a CX.  This differs
**      from the external ADE_OPERAND typedef found in <ade.h> for two reasons.
**      First, it gives us the flexibility to change the internal format of a CX
**      without affecting the interface to the ADE routines.  Second, since the
**      Front End and PC groups are more concerned about space then they are
**      about speed, and since the bulk of a CX will be made up of operands,
**      they wish to have some of the information normally contained in an
**      operand "hidden" in a array of DB_DATA_VALUEs that they will have,
**      anyway.  Therefore, because of this, there will actually be two formats
**      of an ADE_I_OPERAND.  One will be used when compiling ADE for the Back
**      End, and the other will be used when compiling for the Front End or PC
**      group. MACROS will be used to get an ADE_OPERAND from an ADE_I_OPERAND
**      and to put and ADE_OPERAND into an ADE_I_OPERAND so as to maintain one
**      set of source code. Both the MACRO definitions and a #define for either
**	ADE_BACKEND or ADE_FRONTEND will be in the single header file
**	<adefebe.h>.  This will be the only source file that two versions must
**      be kept for. 
**
** History:
**	17-jun-86 (thurston)
**          Initial creation.
**	05-apr-89 (jrb)
**	    Added opr_prec and opr_1rsvd for decimal project.
**	02-aug-2003 (somsa01)
**	    Updated opr_offset to be of type OFFSET_TYPE.
**	20-dec-04 (inkdo01)
**	    Added opr_collID for collations.

**	    Make ADE_I_OPERAND a synonym for ADE_OPERAND for backend,
**	    since the two are identical anyway.

/*}
** Name: ADE_CXSEG - CX segment info for header
**
** Description:
**	Each CX consists of up to 4 different code segments:  the
**	MAIN segment, the INIT segment, the FINIT segment, and the
**	VIRGIN segment.  (There's also constants, but they aren't a
**	code segment as such.)
**
**	The VIRGIN segment is executed once (by QEF) at the start of a
**	query execution, to evaluate expressions that are actually query
**	constants.  While the need for VIRGIN segments is partly due to
**	the current parser's lack of constant folding, we also need them
**	to evaluate query constants that involve repeat query parameters,
**	which aren't known until query execution time.
**	If the CX operates on VLT/VLUPs,  the ADE_CALCLEN instructions
**	needed are found (only) in the VIRGIN segment.
**
**	The INIT segment is for aggregates;  it's executed at the start of
**	a new group to initialize the aggregate value(s) for that group.
**
**	The MAIN segment is the normal code; whatever is to be evaluated
**	for each execution of the CX.  For aggregates, it's the code
**	to first check that the current row is part of the current group,
**	and then it includes the current row into the aggregate(s).
**	(The comparing part might be done elsewhere, for some kinds of
**	aggregates.)
**
**	The FINIT segment is executed when a group is finished;  if there is
**	additional execution needed to finish evaluating an aggregate, like
**	e.g. AVG, it's executed in the FINIT.  FINIT also copies the
**	aggregate results to the output.
**
**	Since keeping track of the various CX segments is pretty much
**	identical for each segment type, we'll define a structure that
**	tracks the segment info.
**
** History:
**	14-Feb-2005 (schka24)
**	    Gather up common segment stuff from CXHEAD.
**	22-Feb-2007 (kschendel)
**	    i2 for instruction count isn't large enough for some of the

**
**	This transformation by itself is of minimal benefit;  but we'll
**	also take the opportunity to resolve the called routine for
**	commonly used operands.  So, instead of calling an "integer add"
**	FI routine that has to figure out the input and result integer
**	lengths, we'll resolve all the way to calling "add i4 and i2
**	giving an i4".  Obviously this means lots more little routines
**	to do the work, but the routines are short and easy to write;
**	and the savings can be significant.
**
**	Some interpreters go even farther, and attempt to arrange for
**	each little called-routine to do some kind of jump (eg an indirect
**	jump) to the next routine in the code sequence.  Unfortunately,
**	that's hard to do in a portable-C manner.  If I'm going to make
**	that sort of effort, we're going all the way to compiling native
**	code on popular platforms.
**
**	Each STCODE operation contains a call type (there are a few different
**	ways of calling the handler routine);  the original ADE_xxx opcode,
**	so that we can write more generic handlers for less time critical
**	operations;  the number of operands, and a list of operands following.
**
**	For the first try, we aren't generating STCODE for front-ends,
**	nor for any CX that contains VLT/VLUPs or large-object code.
**	These restrictions are merely to simplify the initial version.
**
**	The business of first generating a traditional CX, and then
**	generating STCODE from the CX, may sound stupid -- why not just
**	generate the STCODE directly?  That's probably where we want to
**	end up, but to minimize the impact on the rest of the back-end
**	(and to avoid having to figure out how to deal with front-ends),
**	we'll keep all the traditional CX machinery around.  (Note that
**	compiled ABF programs and possibly compiled forms may have
**	traditional CX code wired into them, so removing the traditional
**	stuff is not to be undertaken lightly.)

/*
** Name: STCODE_STATE -- STCODE execution state holder
**
** Description:
**	As execution of an STCODE compiled expression proceeds, we
**	need to keep around various bits of state information.
**	Often, an STCODE handler routine is interested in some of
**	that state (e.g. the next PC, or the current boolean expr value).
**	So, it's convenient to bundle up the state into a structure.
**
**	The STCODE operation list is read-only (multiple sessions
**	could be sharing it), but the execution state is local.  So,
**	this is where we hold resolved operand addresses.  For extreme
**	cases, like unknown-length operands, a duplicate of the entire
**	operation can be resolved into the execution state area, and
**	the PC temporarily pointed to that duplicate.
**
** History:
