**
**  Name: ADUCMP.C - Collation modified general string compare
**
**  Description:
**	This file contains a general string compare function supporting
**	the three major semantics used by the Ingres DBMS.
**
**	    adugcmp - string compare routine
**
**  Function prototypes defined in ADULCOL.H
** 
**  History:
**      03-may-89 (anton)
**	    Created.
**	15-Jun-89 (anton)
**	    Moved to ADU from CL.
**      31-dec-1992 (stevet)
**          Added function prototypes.
**	19-may-93 (geri)
**		Changed order of arguments to adugcmp()- the argument order
**		erroneously changed when routine was prototyped
**	14-jul-93 (ed)
**	    replacing <dbms.h> by <gl.h> <sl.h> <iicommon.h> <dbdbms.h>

**          Bug 53379.
**          Adugcmp() has problems with trailing skip characters in
**          char and varchar strings (i. e., when ADUL_SKIPBLANK is not
**          set).  The loop in adugcmp() checks for EOS, before calling
**          adulcmp, which is a macro that calls adultrans() on both strings
**          and then finds the difference between their weights from the
**          collation table.  The problem is that adultrans() will increment
**          the pointer as long as it sees a skip character, and it will
**          return the weight of the next non-skip character it encounters.
**          Since it has no awareness of EOS, it may walk off the EOS and
**          possibly beyond, if there is garbage at EOS and it happens to be
**          a skip character.
**          The fix is to check for EOS after the call to adulcmp, and employ
**          additional checks to see if the comparison results are valid.
**	25-aug-93 (ed)
**	    remove dbdbms.h
**      18-mar-1994 (pearl)
**          Bug 57982.  The fix for 53379 broke something else.  adugcmp()
**          had to be reworked; see in line comments for details.  One
**          change of note is to copy the strings into a buffer, get rid
**          of trailing white space, and null terminate them.  This solved
**          the problem of garbage at the end of the string that adultrans()
**          would keep devouring.  A particularly difficult case was that
**          of multiple characters that were treated as one character, e. g.
**          'LL'; if the first L was the last character in the string, and
**          the 2nd L was garbage, adultrans() would treat them as one
**          character.  Copying the strings and null terminating them avoided
**          this problem.
**	30-nov-1994 (ramra01)
**			Code Integration from 6.4. There was  a problem with string
**			comparison.
**  05-Aug-1998 (horda03) Cross-Integration of change 437013.
**      24-Jul-1998 (horda03)
**          The fix for Bug 77496 broke the Compilation on AXP platforms. The fix
**          uses MEcopy. So I've included the header file ME.H.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	03-Apr-2002 (hanje04)
**	    BUG 107501
**	    To stop the stack being corrupted when a string >2K is copied
**	    into bsal or bsbl, they are now declared as pointers and dynamically
**	    allocated memory using MEreqmem instead of declaring them as 
**	    u_char arrays on the stack.
**	    This memory is also freed using MEfree before each return()
**	    following the MEreqmem.
