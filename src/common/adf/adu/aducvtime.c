/*
** Name: adu_cvtime() - convert time(secs) to a structure.
**
** Description:
**	  Converts the standard INGRES time into a vector defining the
**	the components of the time and date. The struture returned
**	is defined in "timevect.h".
**
** Inputs:
**      time                            time to convert(secs. since Jan 1, 1970)
**	time_nsec_part			the nano second portion of the time for
**					high resolution time support.
**	t				Ptr to a timevect to be initialized.
** Outputs:
**	t
**	    .tm_sec			normalized seconds in the day.
**	    .tm_min			normalized minutes in the day.
**	    .tm_hour			normalized hours in the day.
**	    .tm_mon			normalized month in the year,
**					0 <= tm_mon <= 11
**	    .tm_year			normalized year, number of years since
**					1900?
**	    .tm_wday			day of week (modulo 7).
**	    .tm_yday			number of days in current year.
**	    
**  Returns:
**      VOID
**
**  Side effects:
**      none
**
**  History:
**      12/26/80 (peb)      -- first written for VMS
**	30-apr-86 (ericj)
**	    Converted for Jupiter.  Removed updatable array msize(non-reentrant)
**	    and reference Adu_ii_dmsize instead.  Added parameter, a pointer to
**	    a timevect struct to be updated, rather than returning a pointer
**	    to a static timevect struct.
**	13-jan-1987 (daved)
**	    avoid loop in calculating year
**	26-jul-2006 (gupsh01)
**	    Added time_nsec_part in the input parameters.
