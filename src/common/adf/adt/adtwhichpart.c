** Name: adtwhichpart.c - Partition Determination functions
**
** Description:
**	This file contains routines used to determine which partition
**	of a horizontally partitioned table a particular row belongs to.
**	Four row distribution schemes are available: automatic (data
**	independent), hash, list, and range.
**
**	Automatic partitioning doesn't depend on the row data at all.
**	We return what is essentially a random number.  (Round-robin
**	would work just as well, except that we don't want to save any
**	state.)
**
**	Hash partitioning takes the distribution column(s), hashes them,
**	and extracts a partition number from the hash.  The extraction
**	simply uses the MOD function (hash mod number-of-partitions).
**
**	Range and list distributions depend on a set of value-to-
**	partition mappings specified by the DBA at table definition time.
**	List partitioning compares the distribution column(s) to each
**	specified value in turn, and when a match is found, that value's
**	partition is used.  Range partitioning compares the distribution
**	column(s) to each value looking for a value range that the
**	row falls into.  List partitioning also specifies a default
**	partition that is used if no match is found.  Range partitioning
**	does not use a default;  the partition definition assures that
**	the given ranges cover the entire data value domain without
**	overlaps or gaps.
**
**	Any one of these schemes may apply to a partitioning dimension.
**	There is also a driver routine which walks through the
**	dimensions, getting the partition sequence for each, and puts
**	it all together into a physical partition number.
**
**	It is important to recognize the difference between a partition
**	*sequence* and a partition *number*.  The former applies to one
**	dimension, while the latter is a physical partition identifier.
**	Additionally, partition sequences are one-origined (like Fortran!),
**	while physical partition numbers are zero-origined.
**	(Partition index might be a better term than partition sequence,
**	by analogy to array indexing;  but index means so many things
**	already...)
**
**	The partition determiners understand about the layout of a
**	partition definition in memory.  In order to figure out a
**	(composite) partitioning value, there is an array of DB_PART_LIST
**	descriptors, one per column.  For LIST and RANGE, there is
**	also a value-to-partition mapping table (a.k.a. breaks table),
**	which is a DB_PART_BREAKS structure.
**
**	The DB_PART_LIST entries give the data types and offsets
**	for each component of a value, while the DB_PART_BREAKS entries
**	give the comparison values, operators, and mapped-to partition
**	numbers.  (By the way, the breaks table has pointers to internal
**	format values, and pointers to uninterpreted text values.  We
**	don't need, look at, or touch in any way the uninterpreted
**	text value pointers.  They are only there for partition maintenance
**	operations, catalog reading and updating, and such.)
**
**	ATTENTION: Calling the AUTOMATIC determiner will return a
**	different number each time unless one provides a deterministic
**	hash value in adf_autohash. Don't call a partition determiner
**	multiple times without one and expect the same answer,
**	unless you know that there are no AUTOMATIC dimensions.
**
**	The functions defined here are:
**	(For all dimensions:)
**	adt_whichpart_no -- Determine a row's physical partition number
**
**	(For a single dimension:)
**	adt_whichpart_auto -- Determine a row's partition sequence: AUTOMATIC
**	adt_whichpart_hash -- Determine a row's partition sequence: HASH
**	adt_whichpart_list -- Determine a row's partition sequence: LIST
**	adt_whichpart_range -- Determine a row's partition sequence: RANGE
**
**	POSSIBLE for later:  do we want/need similar functions given a
**	partition value instead of a row?  only real benefits would be
**	a) value is probably smaller, and b) value would be aligned,
**	might go slightly faster for ints/floats.
**
** History:
**	5-Jan-2004 (schka24)
**	    Create for the Partitioned Table project.
**	04-Apr-2005 (jenjo02)
**	    Added optional adf_autohash for AUTOMATIC.

** Name: adt_whichpart_auto - Determine a row's partition: AUTOMATIC
**
** Description:
**	This routine is given a row, and returns the appropriate
**	partition sequence for an AUTOMATIC partitioning dimension.
**
**	Of course, automatic partitioning is data-independent, so
**	the contents of the supplied row are completely irrelevant!
**
**	USAGE WARNING: This routine may (probably will) return a 
**	different partition sequence each time you call it unless
**	you pass an u_i8 hash value of your choosing in adf_autohash.
**	Without an adf_autohash, don't call adt_whichpart_auto
**	multiple times for the same row and expect to get the
**	same answer each time!
**
**	The idea behind AUTOMATIC is to simply spread out the rows,
**	sort of like location or disk striping.  Round-robin would be
**	plenty good enough, except that doing it right would require
**	maintaining last-partition-assigned state on disk as well
**	as in memory.  Instead, we'll generate a pseudo-random sequence
**	starting with a date-time value.  The seed value is initialized
**	at the first call.  This technique should work reasonably
**	well even with multiple DBMS servers, as it's likely that they
**	will get different starting seeds.
**
**	The code seen here is deliberately not mutexed.  Normally,
**	updating a shared static variable requires either a mutex or use
**	of the CX compare-and-swap routine.  In our case, though,
**	all that matters is that someone gets a number out -- it really
**	doesn't matter if two threads collide!
**
**	Notice that TMhrnow is used to initialize the seed.  That's not
**	because we actually need high resolution;  it's because the
**	other obvious candidate, TMnow, does all sorts of strange and
**	goofy stuff that I'm not interested in.  I just want a number.

** Name: adt_whichpart_hash - Determine a row's partition: HASH
**
** Description:
**	This routine is given a row, and returns the appropriate
**	partition sequence for a HASH partitioning dimension.
**
**	There is actually little work to do here.  A hashing function
**	munches the bytes and returns the hash.  Luckily, the hasher
**	can be seeded with the output of a previous call;  thus, we
**	can hash discontiguous areas with multiple hash calls, and get
**	the same answer as we would if it were a contiguous area.
**
**	The hash function call is very low overhead, so we don't bother
**	attempting to discover contiguous areas in the row buffer.  We simply
**	hash each partition distribution column in turn.
**
**	There are a few datatypes that give trouble.  First, we need to
**	do something with NULLs.  The value part of a NULL is meaningless,
**	and hashing it would be a Bad Idea(TM).  Second, there are various
**	flags in a date value that aren't always set the same.  Third,
**	varchar comparison semantics say that trailing blanks should be
**	stripped, so 'foo' and 'foo ' had better hash the same.  There
**	may be issues with other string-ish datatypes as well.
**
**	Fortunately, all these problems have already been met and more-
**	or-less overcome by the hash storage structure code.  There's
**	a "hashprep" function that takes a value, and returns a
**	fixed-up value that is suitable for hashing.  We'll apply the
**	hashprep function to our row components before hashing each one.

** Inputs:
**	adfcb		ADF session control block

**	row_ptr		Pointer to a row, with partitioning column values

	** land on the 20 or 30.  Clearly the >20 entry is the one
	** we want, but how do you tell?
	** It might seem that another comparison is needed, but actually
	** that is not the case.
	** The binary search loop tells us which direction the very
	** last comparison ended up;  we just have to look at "result".
	** If "result" is pointing in the same direction as the entry
	** we landed on, then that's the one to use.  If not, then
	** we move one entry in the direction of "result" and use that.
	** In the example, if we landed on 20, "result" will be +,
	** which is the same direction as >.  If we landed on >30, "result"
	** will be -, which points in the opposite direction from >;
	** we need to back up one and that must be the right entry.
	** (No gaps, no overlaps.)

/*
** Name: adt_partbreak_compare	- compares the set of part break values
**	for 2 dimensions
**
** Description:
**	This routine is given 2 dimension descriptors and compares the
**	contained value breaks for equality. It determines the length
**	of each break, then loops over the break arrays comparing the
**	values.   The comparison is used to determine partition
**	compatibility of 2 joined tables, so we need to consider
**	anything that would interfere with PC-joining, and allow
**	anything that wouldn't.
**
**	We assume that the caller has checked the obvious stuff,
**	specifically: same number of columns, same number of breaks,
**	compatible types, and same distribution rules.
**
** Inputs:
**	adfcb		Ptr to ADF_CB for error handling
**	pdim1p		Ptr to DB_PART_DIM structure for one of the
**			comparands
**	pdim2p		Ptr to DB_PART_DIM structure for the other 
**			comparand
**
** Outputs:
**
** Returns:
**	TRUE		if the value break sets are identical, otherwise
**	FALSE
** History:
**	23-apr-04 (inkdo01)
**	    Written.
**	29-May-2007 (kschendel) SIR 122513
**	    Relax to allow different lengths and nullability as long as
**	    the actual break values are the same.
