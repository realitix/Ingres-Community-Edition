/*
** Name: apiwait.c
**
** Description:
**	This file contains the IIapi_wait() function interface.
**
**      IIapi_wait  API wait function
**
** History:
**      01-oct-93 (ctham)
**          creation
**      22-apr-94 (ctham)
**          GCsync is changed to allow timeout as an input.  
**      22-apr-94 (ctham)
**          provide a new function IIapi_serviceOpQue() to remove the
**          IIapi_liDispatch(), IIapi_uiDispatch() and IIapi_wait()
**          from going through and dealing with queued events.
**	 3-Nov-94 (gordy)
**	    Added a counter to track nesting of GCsync() calls.  We may
**	    want to disallow nesting as GCsync() may not be re-entrant.
**	20-Jan-95 (gordy)
**	    Only block in GCsync() if GCA is active.
**	23-Jan-95 (gordy)
**	    Cleaned up error handling.
**	 8-Mar-95 (gordy)
**	    Use IIapi_initialized() to test for init.
**	 9-Mar-95 (gordy)
**	    Remove timeout from GCsync() until it is fixed.
**	19-May-95 (gordy)
**	    Fixed include statements.
**	28-Jul-95 (gordy)
**	    Use fixed length types.  Fixed tracing
**	12-Oct-95 (gordy)
**	    Check and set the dispatch flag prior to re-entering the API.
**	    Otherwise, new API events will not get queued and may see
**	    handles which have not been updated to the correct state yet.
**	17-Jan-96 (gordy)
**	    Added environment handles.  Added global data structure.
**	 2-Oct-96 (gordy)
**	    Removed unused MINICODE ifdef's.
**	14-Nov-96 (gordy)
**	    GCsync() now takes timeout.  Serialization control data moved
**	    to thread-local-storage.
