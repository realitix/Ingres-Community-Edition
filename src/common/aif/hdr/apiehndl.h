** Description:
**	Information associated with a Database Event.
**
**	When database event handles are matched to this 
**	database event, they are placed on the database 
**	event handle list and ev_notify is incremented.  
**	When the callback is made for a database event 
**	handle, ev_notify is decremented.  Database 
**	events which occur after the current database
**	event may not be dispatched until all the call-
**	backs have been made for the current database 
**	event (ev_notify == 0).  This permits the app-
**	lication a chance to restart database event 
**	retrievals which may match the subsequent 
**	database events.

**
** Description:
**      This data type defines the database event handle.
**
**	Active database event handles are placed on a queue 
**	of the connection handle.  When a database event is
**	matched to a database event handle, the database
**	event handle is moved to a queue of the database
**	event control block.  The parent data structure 
**	(connection handle or database event control block) 
**	is accessible through eh_parent.
**
**	Cancelled queries are left on the same queue 
**	as active queries until they are closed.  The
**	eh_cancelled flag is used to distinguish the
**	two cases so that matching of database events
**	with cancelled queries can be avoided.
**
**	The eh_done flag is used to indicate that database
**	event data has been retrieved (IIapi_getColumns() 
**	has been called) and that subsequent attepts to get
**	the data should return NO_DATA status.
**
**	NOTE: the functionality provided by eh_done could
**	also be achieved utilizing the state tables and
**	would provide a more extensible solution.  However,
**	it would require two new API events and at least
**	one additional event state and is beyond the scope
**	of what is currently required.
