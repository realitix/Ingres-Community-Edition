**	17-may-05 (inkdo01)
**	    Close and destroy work files after they've been used.
**	7-Jun-2005 (schka24)
**	    A variety of fixes found by 100 Gb TPC-H, mostly in CO joining.

/*
** Name: QEN_HASH_VALUE - generate a row's hash value
**
** Description:
**	This routine computes a 32-bit (unsigned) hash number based
**	on the prepared byte-string row key.  The caller provides
**	the row address (as a QEF_HASH_DUP *), and the length of
**	the key part which is always immediately after the QEF_HASH_DUP
**	header bit.
**
**	Originally, hash join used HSH_CRC, albeit indirectly.
**	Why do anything different?  Well, it turns out that when
**	hash-joining a partitioned table that is hash partitioned,
**	weird "beat" effects can occur if we join on the partitioning
**	columns.  For instance, a partition-compatible join by its
**	nature selects rows with [the high-order bits of] a certain
**	hash value.  If we then attempt to hash-join on the same
**	columns, using the same hash value, we may find that only
**	a few of our hash-join partitions receive rows -- because
**	we selected just those table partitions!  Worse yet, we
**	may discover that many of the rows to be joined land
**	in the same hash-join chain, making the chains very long
**	and slowing the join to a crawl.  Since the user has no
**	control on the number of hash-join partitions selected
**	by qee, the slowdown can appear and disappear seemingly
**	at random.
**
**	A simple solution is to just use a different hash algorithm
**	for hash joining, and that's what we do here.  The chosen
**	algorithm needs to be reasonably well behaved under a variety
**	of inputs.  I've chosen the "lookup3" hash by Bob Jenkins,
**	http://burtleburtle.net/bob/c/lookup3.c
**	which is (amazingly) as efficient as multiplicative hashes
**	like the FNV hash, gives outstanding results, and is free.
**
**	In the hash implementation, I have eliminated a few of the
**	conditionals because we ensure that the row key starts at an
**	aligned 32-bit boundary.  (See QEF_HASH_DUP definition.)
**	The hash operates on 3 i4's at a time, with some special
**	stuff for any partial block at the end.  There are two
**	versions of the final block handling, one for little-endian
**	machines and one for big-endian machines.
**
**	"By Bob Jenkins, 2006.  bob_jenkins@burtleburtle.net.  You may
**	use this code any way you wish, private, educational, or
**	commercial.  It's free."
**	Thanks, Bob!
**
** Inputs:
**	rowptr			QEF_HASH_DUP pointer to a row
**				with key data materialized via a

**	returns nothing.

/*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mix -- mix 3 32-bit values reversibly.

This is reversible, so any information in (a,b,c) before mix() is
still in (a,b,c) after mix().

If four pairs of (a,b,c) inputs are run through mix(), or through
mix() in reverse, there are at least 32 bits of the output that
are sometimes the same for one pair and different for another pair.
This was tested for:
* pairs that differed by one bit, by two bits, in any combination
  of top bits of (a,b,c), or in any combination of bottom bits of
  (a,b,c).
* "differ" is defined as +, -, ^, or ~^.  For + and -, I transformed
  the output delta to a Gray code (a^(a>>1)) so a string of 1's (as
  is commonly produced by subtraction) look like a single 1-bit
  difference.
* the base values were pseudorandom, all zero but one bit set, or 
  all zero plus a counter that starts at zero.

Some k values for my "a-=c; a^=rot(c,k); c+=b;" arrangement that
satisfy this are
    4  6  8 16 19  4
    9 15  3 18 27 15
   14  9  3  7 17  3
Well, "9 15 3 18 27 15" didn't quite get 32 bits diffing
for "differ" defined as + with a one-bit base and a two-bit delta.  I
used http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/avalanche.html to choose 
the operations, constants, and arrangements of the variables.

This does not achieve avalanche.  There are input bits of (a,b,c)
that fail to affect some output bits of (a,b,c), especially of a.  The
most thoroughly mixed value is c, but it doesn't really even achieve
avalanche in c.

This allows some parallelism.  Read-after-writes are good at doubling
the number of bits affected, so the goal of mixing pulls in the opposite
direction as the goal of parallelism.  I did what I could.  Rotates
seem to cost as much as shifts on every machine I could lay my hands
on, and rotates are much kinder to the top and bottom bits, so I used
rotates.

final -- final mixing of 3 32-bit values (a,b,c) into c

Pairs of (a,b,c) values differing in only a few bits will usually
produce values of c that look totally different.  This was tested for
* pairs that differed by one bit, by two bits, in any combination
  of top bits of (a,b,c), or in any combination of bottom bits of
  (a,b,c).

** Name: QEN_HASH_PARTITION - partition a set of rows
**
** Description:
**	Rows of either build or probe sources are delivered to this 
**	function to be partitioned. Function is either called directly
**	from qen_hjoin (with build source rows) or from inside qenhashutl.c
**	(with either probe or build rows, possibly while recursing on
**	a partition too large to fit into the hash table). If more rows 
**	arrive than will fit into the buffer for a partition, the blocks
**	for that partition are written to disk for later processing.
**
**	The caller can specify whether rows should be filtered based on
**	the bit-vector for the partition on the other side.  Filtering
**	is normally turned off for build rows (because there isn't any
**	"other" side yet) and on for probe rows.  Filtering might be
**	turned off if the caller is repartitioning, where it might not
**	be in a position to deal with outer-join nomatch processing.
**
**	The caller can also specify whether the row should be RLL-compressed,
**	assuming that it's not filtered out entirely.  Compression would
**	be attempted if the row is being delivered from one of the original
**	join inputs, and if query setup decides that it might be worthwhile.
**
** Inputs:
**	dsh		- Pointer to thread's DSH
**	hbase		- ptr to base hash structure
**	rowptr		- ptr to build/probe row to be stowed
**	filterflag	- ptr to boolean: TRUE to filter rows, FALSE to
**			  always just store the row
**	try_compress	- TRUE if RLL compression should be attempted on
**			  the row if it isn't filtered out.
**
** Outputs:
**
**	filterflag	- If TRUE upon entry, remains TRUE if row was
**			  filtered out.  FALSE if row was not filtered.

/*{
** Name: QEN_HASH_BUILD - time to build a hash table from current
**			partition set
**
** Description:
**	This function examines the rows input so far and tries to build
**	a hash table to probe against.  The presumption is that we've
**	loaded rows from at least one side (perhaps both) and we need
**	to try to create a hash table.  If no hash table can be created,
**	because all input partitions are too big to fit, a partition is
**	recursively repartitioned until a hash table can be created.
**
**	This function is sensitive to the specific needs of CO joins.
**	The nature of CO joins prevents the use of role reversal and
**	some effort is expended in this module to assure that only the
**	original build source is used to load the hash table for CO
**	joins.
**
**	Comment fatigue warning!
**	Sorry for the outrageous amount of blather, but it's simply
**	a complex task.  The code can probably be simplified beyond
**	what you see, but one is reluctant to break things...
**
**	Because of role reversal, terminology is not as simple as a
**	usual join where there is just left and right.  Here we have
**	the build or hashtable side, the side we propose to build a
**	hashtable from;  and the probing side.  Without any role
**	reversal, the hashtable side is the left (build) input and the
**	probing side is the right (probe) input, but given role
**	reversal the hashtable and probing sides might be switched.
**	If just one side has been loaded so far it's the build/hashtable
**	side.
**
**	Building a hash table is complex because there are so many
**	cases to deal with:
**	- both sides of the current partitioning level loaded, or just one;
**	- some partitions may have spilled to disk;
**	- some partitions on either side may not have spilled at all (*);
**	- in-memory partitions may have extra buffer space that can be
**	  used to help load additional spilled partitions into;
**	- some partitions may be empty, on either side, with or without a
**	  partition buffer allocated;
**	- If just one side is loaded, spilled partitions may not have
**	  flushed (so that the last block is still in the partition buffer).
**	
**	(*) note however that only one side, hashtable or probing, may have
**	nonempty in-memory partitions; not both sides.  If some partition
**	of the first side loaded fits into memory, a hash table can and
**	will be constructed from that partition, and it will be consumed
**	as the other, probing side loads.
**
**	To build a hash table, there are again many possibilities.
**	- if the hashtable side has in-memory (unspilled) partitions, use
**	them to build a hash table, plus whatever spilled partitions
**	we can fit in.
**	- If the hashtable side has no in-memory partitions, but the probing
**	side does, do a role reversal and build a hash table out of those
**	probing partitions, plus any other probing partitions that fit.
**	- If there aren't any in-memory partitions, try to use available
**	partition buffer space to reload one or more spilled partitions.
**	Important note here: if just one side has been loaded, we can't
**	steal buffers from other spilled partitions.  We need those
**	buffers to load and maybe spill the probing side.  If we've loaded
**	both sides, than any spilled partition buffer is fair game.
**	- If we can't fit any hashtable-side partitions, but we can reload
**	and fit some probing-side partitions, do a role reversal.
**	- If nothing fits, do a recursion (i.e. open a new level, choose
**	a partition, and subdivide it).  Then repeat the above process,
**	starting with whichever side recursion decided to load first.
**
**	Notes to above discussion:
**	- CO joins can't do role reversal, and the code has to deal with
**	that limitation.  For CO joins, the hashtable side is ALWAYS the
**	left input and the probing side is ALWAYS the right input.
**	- Upon initial entry at the very top, either both sides are loaded,
**	or just the left/build side is (at the top level).  The only time
**	that the probe side is loaded first is during a role-reversed
**	recursion, and we do that inside the body of the decision loops.
**	- If both sides are loaded, it doesn't matter which side we
**	start looking at, we can figure out role reversal if needed.
**	- Given the last two points, upon initial entry we'll always start
**	with the build/left side as the hashtable side, and go from there.
**	- After finishing up loading the second side (ie when setting
**	BOTH-LOADED), we always immediately flush spilled buffers.
**	So, in the both-loaded case, we can assume that any buffer for
**	a spilled partition has nothing important in it, and is fair game.
**	- If you read the code very closely, you'll see that if the hashtable
**	side is entirely empty, we announce "done" no matter what's in the
**	probing side.  That is safe because the situation never arises.
**	(You never recurse on an empty partition, and if the build
**	input is empty at the top level, the hash join driver handles
**	it as a special case - either no joins or by-hand right/full OJ.)

** Side Effects:
**
**
** History:
**	5-mar-99 (inkdo01)
**	    Written.
**	jan-00 (inkdo01)
**	    Changes for cartprod logic, various bug fixes.
**	28-jan-00 (inkdo01)
**	    Tidy up hash memory management.
**	8-feb-00 (inkdo01)
**	    Added logic for CO joins.
**	23-aug-01 (devjo01)
**	    Remove redundant and incorrect init of htable[0].
**	25-oct-01 (inkdo01)
**	    Fix bug with CO joins in which probe partitions fit in memory.
**	10-jan-02 (inkdo01)
**	    Fix minor bug in free chain management (106785).
**	13-mar-02 (inkdo01)
**	    Fix a bug when the free chain starts life empty.
**	28-mar-03 (inkdo01)
**	    Don't take "last block still in buffer" shortcut if FLUSHED
**	    flag is on for partition.
**	27-june-03 (inkdo01)
**	    "Last block in buffer" logic entered with faulty test that
**	    didn't work if block was almost full (bug 110498).
**	4-nov-03 (inkdo01)
**	    Another boundary condition involving overflowed partition and
**	    partition size that's a multiple of row size (bug 111226).
**	12-jan-04 (inkdo01)
**	    Fine tuning of previous fix - left out the "exact multiple" bit.
**	21-june-04 (inkdo01)
**	    Allocate hsp_bptr/bvptr in tandem to avoid later SEGVs.
**	14-july-04 (inkdo01)
**	    Add QEF_CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPT to avoid long loops in hash processing.
**	22-jul-04 (toumi01)
**	    A partition can be used even if it is an exact fit; this change
**	    keeps us from falling into a black hole looking for partitions.
**	3-Jun-2005 (schka24)
**	    Release files when a recursion level is done.  This reduces
**	    disk usage, as we'll be able to re-use the files if we return
**	    to that level later.  Also, copy back partition buffer addresses,
**	    since the just-completed level may have allocated more partition
**	    buffers (if some outer level partitions had nothing hash to them.)
**	8-Jun-2005 (schka24)
**	    Pitch out partitions that have both sources loaded, and one
**	    side is empty, and we don't need the other side for OJ.
**	    Not only does this eliminate useless partitions more quickly,
**	    but it also prevents am SC0206 "didn't need to recurse" error.
**	13-Jun-2005 (schka24)
**	    Rework partition selection.  Various comments notwithstanding,
**	    we were still grabbing partition buffers for the hash heap when
**	    they were needed to buffer/write probe rows.
**	    Fix bug related to 111226 above, a row can start at the beginning
**	    of the last-block-in-memory partition buffer even if rowsize isn't
**	    a multiple of the partition buffer size.
**	10-Jul-2005 (schka24)
**	    Last round of changes forgot to clear bufrows upon role reversal,
**	    often leading to QE0002.  Fix.
**	23-Dec-2005 (kschendel)
**	    Make sure that "firstbr" is cleared.  If last probe of prior
**	    hash table matched, it can be left on, pointing at garbage and
**	    confusing the first probe into the new hash.
**      23-Oct-2006 (huazh01)
**          check if both 'this' and 'other' side of partition are empty 
**          before calling qen_hash_insert(). This prevents setting 
**          'this_inmem', 'mustflip' ...., etc. to wrong value when there is 
**          actually nothing being inserted into the hash table. 
**          This fixes b116580.  
**	24-Apr-2006 (kschendel)
**	    Fix the test for when we've reached the last (in-memory) block
**	    when building spilled partitions.  Old test broke if build rows
**	    were very large (testcase had 3768 byte rows in a 16K chunk).
**	28-May-2008 (jgramling)
**	    Preliminary hack to improve hash table allocation in PC joins.
**	    Check if current hash table is too small (at least 10% more rows
**	    in incoming build size than current hash table dimension)
**	    before deciding to reuse.  Skewed data in PC joins can have a 
**	    severe performance impact: a small partition processed
**	    early-on can result in a hash table that is much too small 
**	    for later partitions that have many more rows.
**	9-Jan-2009 (kibro01) b121352
**	    It is possible to end up with a single partition containing too
**	    much to stop it spilling but not all the same values, and with
**	    no rows on the other side, so in this case it needs to be recursed
**	    upon, but the existing logic leaves us trying to recurse and break
**	    down the side with the fewer rows, which is wrong (0 rows can't
**	    be split) so reverse rolls before recursing.
**	18-Jun-2008 (kschendel) SIR 122512
**	    Rework to operate on bytes rather than rows, now that rows can
**	    be compressed (and hence of varying lengths).  One implication is
**	    that space can no longer be calculated exactly, including row
**	    splits, so allow a modicum of extra hashtable space.
**	    Stop wasting the bitvector space, we can use it.
**	    Refine/move Jim's hash pointer table fixes from above.
**	31-Mar-2010 (smeke01 b123516
**	    Add BCANDIDATE/PCANDIDATE to trace displays.
**	24-Jun-2010 (smeke01) b123456
**	    Whenever we set the flag HASH_NOHASHT in hbase->hsh_flags, make
**	    sure that we also unset the HASH_BUILD_OJS flag.

/*{
** Name: QEN_HASH_PROBE2	- phase II of probe
**
** Description:
**	This routine oversees the processing of joins not performed
**	during the phase I probe (as rows are actually materialized 
**	from the probe source). It coordinates the building of hash
**	tables from partitions not yet processed (either build or probe
**	partitions). And if no remaining partitions are small enough
**	to fit a hash table, it drives recursive partitioning until
**	they are small enough.
**
** Inputs:
**	dsh		- Pointer to thread's DSH
**	hbase		- ptr to base hash structure
**	buildptr	- ptr to addr of build row buffer (to return row)
**	probeptr	- ptr to addr of probe row (to return row)
**	ojmask		- ptr to returned mask word for OJs
**
** Outputs:
**
** Side Effects:
**
**
** History:
**	30-mar-99 (inkdo01)
**	    Written.
**	6-dec-99 (inkdo01)
**	    Added logic for recursion processing.
**	jan-00 (inkdo01)
**	    Changes for cartprod logic, various bug fixes.
**	2-feb-00 (inkdo01)
**	    Logic for first non-OJ call to probe2, to tidy up phase1 pass.
**	9-aug-02 (inkdo01)
**	    Added "indptr" local to pass the hash table row indicator address to 
**	    qen_hash_probe (as determined by reverse flag).
**	27-june-03 (inkdo01)
**	    Dropped "*ojmask == 0" test at loop's end - it prevented OJ
**	    processing on hash table rows (bug 110499).
**	29-aug-04 (inkdo01)
**	    Support global base array to reduce build/probe  row movement.
**	8-Jun-2005 (schka24)
**	    "End" partitions that have no probe rows if between phases
**	    1 and 2 (non-OJ only).
**	17-Jun-2005 (schka24)
**	    Fix read-too-far when a partition ends exactly at the end of
**	    a block.
**	14-Nov-2005 (schka24)
**	    Tidy up indptr stuff, set NOJOIN when fetching a new probe.
**	28-nov-05 (inkdo01)
**	    Fix bug handling outer joins in which inner side is build source
**	    and some partitions have no build rows, but some probe rows 
**	    (which are immediately OJ candidates).
**	6-dec-05 (inkdo01)
**	    Quick fix to cover an edge case of above change.
**	15-May-2007 (kschendel)
**	    Repair allojs logic:  set it each time in, as we process the
**	    all-oj probes, else it wastes time in probing;  and don't let the
**	    return logic kick in until we've actually fetched a probing row.
**	23-Aug-2007 (kschendel)
**	    Fix the last bug in hash join again.  :)  ojset was being used
**	    in two different senses: build OJ in the build-oj's-flush loop,
**	    or probe OJ in the main loop when the partitioning bit-filter
**	    guarantees a probing nomatch.  Unfortunately it was only set
**	    for the former sense, causing bogus OJ returns from the latter.
**	    The OQUAL or JQUAL in the caller would usually catch the bad
**	    oj and throw it out, but not always.
**	    Break up ojset so that it's clear which OJ is meant.
**	    (Note that this only happens in "recurse" mode and then only if
**	    some recursed partitions fit and some didn't;  very hard to
**	    reproduce!)
**	18-Jun-2008 (kschendel) SIR 122512
**	    Rework for variable row sizes.
**	30-Jun-2008 (kschendel) SIR 122512
**	    Minor code bumming for small speed and clarity improvements.
**	    Add a "fast path" for the most common case of probing from a
**	    current-level partition.
**	24-Sep-2008 (inkdo01) b120656
**	    Initialise pojset on each loop to avoid erroneous hash join results
**	22-Dec-08 (kibro01) b121373
**	    Unset ojmask so we don't get erroneous full outer join results
**	24-Jun-10 (smeke01) b123968
**	    Move the initialisation of allojs to the top of the main for-loop.

** Name: qen_hash_readrow - Read new spill bufferful with possibly split row
**
** Description:
**	When one of the repartition or probe2 loops needs to read a row
**	that isn't already in the read buffer in its entirety, this routine
**	is called to read a new buffer-load.
**
**	If the last row in the previous bufferful was split, the complete
**	row is reconstructed in the workrow area.  Otherwise we just need
**	to read a new bufferful.
**
**	Since there's a fair amount of fiddling around here, due to
**	having to read the entire row header before we know the row length,
**	this (comparatively rare) case has been extracted from the
**	probe2 inline code for clarity.
**
**	Note that readrow isn't appropriate for standard hash table build
**	because it doesn't know about the in-lastbuf business;  nor is it
**	used for cart-prod because cart-prod needs to handle two work rows.
**
** Inputs:
**	dsh			Thread's data segment header
**	hbase			Hash join base info structure
**	hpptr			Pointer to hash partition being read
**	probep			An output
**
** Outputs:
**	probep			Set to address of row, either in read
**				buffer, or in work row area
**	Returns E_DB_OK or error status
**
** History:
**	23-Jun-2008 (kschendel) SIR 122512

/*{
** Name: QEN_HASH_CARTPROD	- cross product of ALLSAME partitions
**
** Description:
**	This routine performs a cross product join of the build/probe
**	rows from a partition in which both sources won't fit the 
**	memory resident hash table and all the rows of at least one
**	source have the same hashkeys. This last factor makes 
**	recursion useless, since all rows would again be assigned to
**	the same partition and the partition would not be reduced in
**	size. 
**
**	This hopefully rare phenomenon leaves no alternative but to
**	perform a cross-product of the rows of each source for this
**	partition. One source is chosen to drive the join (the "outer"
**	source), and for each of its rows, every row is read and matched
**	from the other ("inner") source. Logic is also required to 
**	handle outer joins with such data.
**
**	In the case of a check-only cart-prod situation, the cart-prod
**	setup has arranged for the check-only side (probe input) to be
**	the "outer" of the cross-product.  No true cross-product is done
**	in this case;  we arrange to ask for a new outer each time.
**
**	For outer joins, we'll handle all the OJ checking logic here.
**	All that the top level has to do is update the OJ indicator
**	bytes properly (i.e. if the "on" clause CX says that the rows
**	really do join).
**
**	*Caution* the guy who sets up cross-producting (qen_hash_recurse)
**	can set local reversal for this one partition.  This reversal
**	flag is set in the HCP control block flags, NOT the usual
**	hashjoin hsh_flags.  Be very careful about calling utility
**	routines that might expect role reversal to be set in hsh_flags!
**
** Inputs:
**	dsh		- DSH execution control block for thread
**	hbase		- ptr to base hash structure
**	buildptr	- ptr to addr of build row buffer (to return row)
**	probeptr	- ptr to addr of probe row
**	ojmask		- ptr to returned mask word for OJs
**	gotone		- ptr to flag indicating whether a (joined) row is 
**			being returned

** Outputs:

** Side Effects:
**
**
** History:
**	7-jan-00 (inkdo01)
**	    Written.
**	22-aug-01 (inkdo01)
**	    Added code to precheck for null join cols (to avoid "null = null"
**	    joins).
**	15-jan-03 (inkdo01)
**	    Minor fixes to full/right join logic to correct failing calls
**	    to qen_hash_write.
**	24-jan-03 (inkdo01)
**	    One last change to fix full/right joins.
**	22-apr-03 (inkdo01)
**	    Really one last change to fix full/right joins.
**	29-aug-04 (inkdo01)
**	    Add logic for global base array to reduce data movement for 
**	    build/probe rows.
**	17-may-05 (inkdo01)
**	    Destroy files at end - not just free them.
**	7-Jun-2005 (schka24)
**	    cartprod during check-only join didn't work, make it work.
**	    Also, clean out partition file ptrs, since we destroy the
**	    files per the previous edit.
**	14-Nov-2005 (schka24)
**	    Don't bother passing OJ indptrs around.
**	17-Jun-2006 (kschendel)
**	    Deal with one side being empty (OJ case).
**	    from returning too few rows. This change fixes bug 118200.
**	5-Apr-2007 (kschendel)
**	    Fix some bugs, mostly for outer join:
**	    - slip-ups in row reading logic could leave pointers aimed at
**	    the wrong place instead of at the just-read row.
**	    - if OJ outer is not allsame but inner is, and if first outer's
**	    hash didn't match the inner, we weren't setting READ_OUTER before
**	    returning the OJ, and the first row was fetched twice.
**	    - When rows split read buffers (either side), the OJ indicator
**	    byte is in one of the work rows.  On the left side we were
**	    clearing the wrong thing, garbaging data.  On the right side,
**	    a possibly set OJ indicator wasn't being written back to the
**	    buffer for writing back to the inner spill file.
**	31-may-07 (hayke02 for schka24)
**	    Only continue/return from the outer row FOR loop if HCP_IALLSAME
**	    is set. This prevents reversed cart prod (check only) hash joins
**	20-Jun-2008 (kschendel) SIR 122512
**	    Extract out read-a-row bits to cater to variable length rows.
**	24-Sep-2008 (kschendel) SIR 122512
**	    NULL key component wasn't inhibiting the key compare as it should
**	    have been;  thus, rows would join that shouldn't.  Fix.

/*
** Name: qen_hash_cpreadrow - Fetch next row for cart-prod
**
** Description:
**	When doing a nested-loop join on an allsame partition (cartprod),
**	we're reading both halves of the spill file.  In order to
**	make sure split rows are handled properly, this routine is called
**	to either point to the next row in a buffer, or read the next
**	bufferful and deal with a possibly split row.  Outer-side split
**	rows are returned in workrow, and inner-side split rows are
**	returned in workrow2.
**
**	If the inner side is outer-joining, the current bufferful has to
**	(usually) be written back out to keep the OJ indicators on disk
**	up-to-date until the join is complete.  This write-back can be
**	skipped if we're on the final outer-join read pass.  Things get
**	even more complicated when doing an OJ on a split row, as the row
**	in workrow2 might have to be written back.  For this condition, a
**	flag in the cart-prod control structure is set so that the driver
**	can deal with it.
**
**	Since speed is not as much at issue with cart-prod (the join is
**	already in deep trouble speed-wise), cpreadrow does everything;
**	unlike the normal readrow which expects the caller to handle the
**	no-read case.
**
** Inputs:
**	dsh			Thread's data segment header
**	hbase			Hash join base info structure
**	hcpptr			Pointer to cart-prod control structure
**	rowpp			An output
**	readouter		TRUE if reading outer side, else inner
**	rewrite_inner		TRUE if doing inner side and need to rewrite
**				inners (for OJ flag purposes).  Must only be
**				true if readouter is false!
**
** Outputs:
**	rowpp			Set to address of row, either in appropriate
**				buffer, or in one of the work row areas
**	Returns E_DB_OK or error status
**
** History:
**	23-Jun-2008 (kschendel) SIR 122512

/*
** Name: qen_hash_htalloc -- (Re)Allocate hash pointer table
**
** Description:
**	This routine is called the first time that a new hash table
**	is about to be constructed.  It verifies that a hash pointer
**	table exists, and is appropriately sized.  If not, a (new)
**	hash pointer table is built.  In either case, the hash pointer
**	table is zeroed out.
**
**	One situation to guard against is a pointer table that exists
**	but is much too small.  This can occur with unevenly distributed
**	PC-joins, or somewhat less commonly when hash-join partitions
**	are unevenly distributed.  If an existing pointer table is too
**	small, long chains build up in the hash table, leading to
**	quadratic insert behaviour and much CPU time wastage.  In a
**	worst case, the first PCjoin group might have one row, and the
**	next might have millions!
**
**	"Too small" is a tough call, especially when it's impossible to
**	know a priori how many rows will actually get inserted;  but
**	as an estimate, assume a row count based on use of all partition
**	buffers as hash space, and a row width between minimum and
**	maximum (weighted towards the minimum).  A too-large pointer
**	table is better than a too-small one;  on the other hand,
**	don't allocate megabytes for 10 rows.
**
**	The call to htalloc should be deferred until hash table build
**	has actually decided how to load the hash table, so that we
**	can use row counts/sizes from the proper side.
**
** Inputs:
**	dsh			Pointer to thread's data segment heaer
**	hbase			Pointer to hash join base structure
**
** Outputs:
**	Returns E_DB_OK or error status
**
** Side effects:
**	Sets hsh_htable and hsh_htsize (rows) in hash join structure.
**
** History:
**	23-Jun-2008 (kschendel) SIR 122512
**	    Refine jgramling's original hash-pointer-table fix slightly.
**	11-Sep-2009 (kschendel) SIR 122513

**	7-Jun-2005 (schka24)
**	    non-spilled-too case has to watch out for empty partitions.
**	    It's a bit unusual, but can happen when the input is large with
**	    a few discrete values (some partitions fill up and others stay
