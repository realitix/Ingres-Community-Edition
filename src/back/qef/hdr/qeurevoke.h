** Name:    QEU_MATCH_PRIV_INFO - description of privileges being checked in the
**				  course of determining whether certain
**				  privileges are still possessed by a specified
**				  grantee
**
** Description:
**	To determine whether an <auth id> still possesses a privilege, it is not
**	sufficient to find some permit granting that privilege to the <auth id>
**	or to PUBLIC.  Consider an example:
**
**	    U1: create table U1.T (i i);
**		grant select on U1.T to PUBLIC with grant option;
**	    U2: grant select on U1.T to PUBLIC with grant option;
**	    U1: revoke select on U1.T from public cascade;
**	    
**	If we were to claim that an <auth id> still possesses a privilege as
**	long as there is a permit granting it that privilege, we would
**	mistakenly fail to destroy the permit created by U2.
**
**	To avoid cases like this as well as possible cycles in the privilege
**	graph, we need to keep track of privileges checked so far and discard
**	those whose existence is not supported (directly or indirectly) by a
**	privilege granted by the object owner.
**
**	This can be reduced to searching for a path in a privilege graph defined
**	as follows:
**	    for a DBMS object X owned by U let G(X) be a directed graph
**	    consisting of
**	      case:
**	        (1) if X is a table or a view, then nodes labelled (U,P,C) and
**		    (U,P',C) for every legal privilege P on every column of X
**		    and nodes labelled (A,P,C) for every <auth id> A s.t. there
**		    is a permit granting P WGO on column C of X to A or to
**		    PUBLIC
**		    and nodes labelled (A,P',C) for every <auth id> A s.t. there
**		    is a permit granting P [WGO] on column C of X to A or to
**		    PUBLIC.
**	        (2) if X is a dbproc or a dbevent, then then nodes labelled
**		    (U,P) and (U,P') for every legal privilege P on X
**		    and nodes labelled (A,P) for every <auth id> A s.t. there is
**		    a permit granting P WGO on X to A or to PUBLIC,
**		    and nodes labelled (A,P') for every <auth id> A s.t. there
**		    is a permit granting P [WGO] on X to A or to PUBLIC.
**	    and
**	      case:
**	        (1) if privilege(s) apply to a table or a view X, then edges
**		    from node (A,P,C) to node (B,P,C) existing iff B granted
**		    privilege P WGO on column C of X to A or to PUBLIC
**		    and edges from node (A,P',C) to node (B,P',C) existing iff B
**		    granted privilege P [WGO] on column C of X to A or to
**		    PUBLIC.
**	        (2) if privilege(s) apply to a dbproc or a dbevent X, then edges
**	            (A,P) to node (B,P) existing iff B granted privilege P WGO
**		    on X to A or to PUBLIC
**		    and edges from node (A,P') to node (B,P') existing iff B
**		    granted privilege P [WGO] on X to A or to PUBLIC.
**
**	If X is a table or a view owned by U2, we will say that an <auth id> U1
**	possesses a privilege P WGO on a set of attributes S of X if in the
**	privilege graph G(X) described above, for every attribute s in S there
**	is a path from node (U1,P,s) to node (U2,P,s).
**
**	If X is a table or a view, we will say that an <auth id> U1 possesses a
**	privilege P on a set of attributes S of X if in the privilege graph G(X)
**	described above, for every attribute s in S there exists an edge from
**	(U1,P',s) to (U2,P',s) or there exists some other <auth id> U3 such that
**	there is an edge from (U1,P',s) to (U3,P',s) and there is a path from
**	node (U3,P,s) to node (U2,P,s).
**	
**	If X is a dbevent or a dbproc, we will say that an <auth id> U1
**	possesses a privilege P WGO on X if in the privilege graph G(X)
**	described above, there is a path from node (U1,P) to node (U2,P).
**
**	If X is a dbevent or a dbproc, we will say that an <auth id> U1
**	possesses a privilege Pon X if in the privilege graph G(X) described
**	above, there is an edge from (U1,P') to (U2,P') or there exists some
**	other <auth id> U3 such that there is an edge from (U1,P') to (U3,P')
**	and there is a path from node (U3,P) to node (U2,P).
**	
**	The privilege graph may contain cycles and in order to avoid them, we
**	will store representation of nodes already visited in a table with
**	tuples of type QEU_MATCH_PRIV_INFO.

** Name: QEU_PDI_TBL_DESCR - (PDI stands for Privilege Depth_info) 
**			     Structure containing control blocks and various 
**			     pointers needed to create, open, and destroy the 
**			     temp table which will contain descriptions of 
**			     privileges whose depths have changed as well as 
**			     fetch/insert tuples from/into that table
** Description:
**	Destruction/alteration of permits in the course of processing 
**	DROP PERMIT and REVOKE statements may force us to recompute depths of
**	some permits.  In the past, we were trying to recompute permit depths 
**	by calling qeu_depth() whenever some permit was dropped or altered.
**	Because this would generally happen BEFORE we had a chance to check for
**	abandoned permits, we had to insist that qeu_depth() may update depth 
**	of a given permit at most once during one invocation (this kept us from
**	getting stuck in cycles formed by permits conveying abandoned 
**	privileges which would eventually get cleaned up by qeu_priv_revoke()).
**
**	Unfortunately, there are plenty of cases where this restriction 
**	prevented us from correctly recomputing permit depths.  In order to 
**	solve this problem, will will remove the restrictions on number of 
**	times qeu_depth() may recompute depth of a given permit and qeu_depth()
**	will only be called when qeu_match_privs() determines that some 
**	privilege is not abandoned and the aggregate depth of permits conveying
**	that privilege is greater than that of the permit that was dropped or 
**	altered.  
**
**	While this will work for privileges that can be granted only on per 
**	object basis, complications may arise with revocation of 
**	column-specific privileges.  In particular, it is possible for a single
**	permit to convey privilege which is abandones one a subset of attributes
**	named in the permit.  As a result, qeu_depth() may find itself stuck
**	in a cycle formed by 2 or more permits s.t. privilege they convey on 
**	some of the attributes is abandoned.  
**
**	A sure way to avoid getting caught in cycles of abandones privileges is
**	to complete performing revocation of the specified privilege(s) before
**	attempting to recompute depths of remaining permits.  Originally, 
**	I was contemplating saving only a description of privilege(s) 
**	explicitly revoked by the user, but this would not be sufficient 
**	since this information alone would not always enable us to determine 
**	all permits whose depths need to be recomputed.  So I opted to save 
**	descriptions of all privileges such that the aggregate depth of 
**	permits conveying them has increased as a result of revoking specified 
**	privilege(s) in a temp table which will be handed to qeu_depth() once 
**	we completed destruction/alteration of permits affected by revocation 
**	of specified privilege(s).  
**
**	This structure will contain pointers to structures which will be used 
**	to create, open, read, write, and close the temp table which will 
**	contain descriptions of privileges s.t. depth of permits conveying 
**	them has increased as a result of revoking specified privilege(s).  
**	Function initiating the revocation (qeu_dprot() or qeu_revoke() will 
**	create and open the table, qeu_match_privs() will populate it with 
**	descriptions of privileges and qeu_depth() will recompute depths of 
**	permits dependent on privileges stored in the table
