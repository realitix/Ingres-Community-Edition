**
** Description:
**  In the course of creating new permit(s), this structure will be used to keep
**  track of permits subsumed by the permit(s) to be created + of existing
**  (if any) privilege descriptors which describe privileges on which new
**  permit(s) depend.

**	17-jul-92 (andre)
**	    added qeu_flags and defined QEU_SET_ALL_TO_ALL and
**	    QEU_SET_RETR_TO_ALL.  The new masks will be used by qeu_scan_perms()
**	    to communicate to its caller whether PUBLIC will posess ALL or
**	    RETRIEVE as a result of creation fo new privileges.  Note that if
**	    the masks will be set only if the already exsiting permit tuples did
**	    not convey these privileges to PUBLIC but the UNION of existing
**	    permits and of the newly created permits will.
