/**
** Name: QSFINT.H - All definitions needed only inside QSF.
**
** Description:
**      This file contains all of the typedefs and defines that are
**      needed internally to QSF.  This file depends on the following
**	files already being #included:
**		dbms.h
**		qsf.h (for QSO_OBID, at least)
**		cs.h	(for the CS_SEMAPHOREs)
**
**      This file defines the following typedefs:
**          QSO_OBJ_HDR	   - Object header.
**          QSO_MASTER_HDR - Master object header.
**          QSO_HASH_TAB   - Object hash table.
**          QSR_CB	   - QSF server control block.
**
** History: $Log-for RCS$
**      14-mar-86 (thurston)
**          Initial creation.
**	23-apr-86 (thurston)
**	    Major overhaul.
**      02-mar-87 (thurston)
**	    Added the standard structure header, and the .qsr_streamid member
**	    to the QSR_CB typedef.  Also removed the .qsr_inited member.
**	13-may-87 (thurston)
**	    Upped the QSF_MEMPOOL_SIZE to be 1/4 Mb, instead of 64 Kb.
**	19-may-87 (thurston)
**	    Added group of #defines for QSF trace points.
**	29-may-87 (thurston)
**	    Changed the block size of QTREE's and QP's from 4K to 1K.
**	04-jun-87 (thurston)
**	    Added the constants QSF_PBASE_BYTES and QSF_PBYTES_PER_SES used
**	    in calculating the size of QSF's memory pool based on max number
**	    of active sessions.
**	05-jul-87 (thurston)
**	    Added the .qsr_tracing member to the QSR_CB typedef.
**	28-nov-87 (thurston)
**	    Changed the SCF_SEMAPHORE to a CS_SEMAPHORE in the QSR_CB typedef,
**	    to enable easier usage of CS{p,v}_semaphore() routines instead of
**	    going through SCF.
**	25-mar-88 (thurston)
**	    Added QSF info request trace point QSF_510_POOLMAP to generate a
**	    ULM Memory Pool Map in the log file for QSF's memory pool.
**	31-aug-1989 (sandyh)
**	    Change QSF_PBYTES_PER_SES from 40K to 80K to lessen QSF memory
**	    errors. This is a stop gap measure until more work is done to
**	    figure out the reason QSF is not freeing long term objs correctly.
**	08-Jan-1992 (fred)
**	    Added associated external object list to object header.  This done
**	    in support of peripheral object (aka large object) support.
**	20-mar-92 (rog)
**	    Added QSF info request trace point QSF_506_LRU_FLUSH to flush
**	    all LRU-able objects from the QSF memory pool.
**	28-aug-92 (rog)
**	    Prototype QSF.
**	16-oct-92 (rog)
**	    Modify structures to support the new pieces added by the
**	    FIPS constraints project.
**	19-oct-92 (rog)
**	    Added the QSO_MASTER_HDR structure to support multiple query plans
**	    per semantically-equivalent query.
**	03-nov-1992 (rog)
**	    Removed the QSS_MEM structure.
**	16-nov-1992 (rog)
**	    Added the QSF_507_SIZE_STATS trace point to display max sizes
**	    allocated/requested.
**	30-nov-1992 (rog)
**	    Added the QSF_DECAY_FACTOR #define to set the default decay factor
**	    for LRU objects.  Moved QSF_TRSTRUCT out of this file and into qsf.h
**	15-jan-1993 (rog)
**	    Added the QSF_MAX_ORPHANS #define to set maximum number of times
**	    we iterate through the orphan detection code.
**	12-mar-1993 (rog)
**	    Added a prototype for the qso_destroyall() function.
**	23-dec-1993 (rog)
**	    Added a prototype for the qso_sandd() function.
**	28-mar-1994 (rog)
**	    Added qso_size to the QSO_OBJ_HDR structure.
**	27-apr-1994 (rog)
**	    Added prototypes for qsf_attach_inst() and qsf_detach_inst().
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	10-Jan-2001 (jenjo02)
**	    Added GET_QSF_CB macro to replaces qsf_session() function.
**	    Added *QEF_CB parm to qsf_clrmem() prototype.
**	26-Sep-2003 (jenjo02)
**	    Added QSF_508_LRU_DISPLAY trace point, reworked mutexing
**	    scheme to eliminate qso_psem bottleneck.
**      12-Apr-2004 (stial01)
**          Define length as SIZE_TYPE.
**      7-oct-2004 (thaju02)
**          Define qsr_memtot and qsr_memleft as SIZE_TYPE for memory pool > 2Gig.
**      18-Feb-2005 (hanal04) Bug 112376 INGSRV2837
**          Added prototype for qsf_clrsesobj().
**	21-Feb-2005 (schka24)
**	    Get rid of separate alias object, put FE alias right in the
**	    master.  This is necessary to eliminate lookup vs delete races,
**	    besides being simpler.  Fix up comments a little.
**      10-Jul-2006 (hanal04) Bug 116358
**          Added QSF_511_ULM_PRINT to call ulm_print_pool for QSF.
**	9-feb-2007 (kibro01) b113972
**	    Add parameter to qso_destroy, qso_rmvobj and qso_unlock
**	    so that in qso_rmvobj we know if we have locked qsr_psem
**	11-feb-2008 (smeke01) b113972
**	    Backed out above cross.
**      17-feb-09 (wanfr01) b121543

** Name: QSO_OBJ_HDR - Object header.
**
** Description:
**      This structure defines a QSF object header.  One of these structures
**	will be created and placed at the front of the object's memory stream
**      for each object that gets created in QSF's memory via a call to
**      QSO_CREATE. Its purpose is to provide a mechanism to chain all objects
**      that exists for the server as a whole, and to act as a repository for
**      information about its corresponding object.  This includes the object
**      name, if it has one, the object's lock state, the "root" for the object,
**      the streamid, and several other pieces of accounting information about
**      the object. 
**
**	Object headers come in two flavors:  named and un-named.  Un-named
**	objects are purely private to a specific session, and are
**	manipulated solely by object handle.  (Which QSF knows internally
**	is the object header address.)
**
**	Named objects are a bit more complicated.  Named objects are always
**	QP objects (although QSF doesn't depend on that, I hope).  A
**	named object will point to an object master which is used to
**	control access to the object(s) of the given name.  Rarely, more
**	than one object can have the same name -- this happens with set-
**	input DB procedures, where we allow multiple QP's (possibly
**	differing based on input temp table size) for the same DBP.
**
** History:
**	14-mar-86 (thurston)
**          Initial creation.
**	23-apr-86 (thurston)
**	    Major overhaul.	
**	26-jan-88 (thurston)
**	    Added .qso_lrnext and .qso_lrprev.
**	08-Jan-1992 (fred)
**	    Added .qso_aeo_next & .qso_aeo_prev.  These form the linked list
**	    of Associated External Objects (QSF_AEO's -- in qsf.h) which allow
**	    QSF to inform external object managers that its base object is about
**	    to be destroyed.
**	19-oct-1992 (rog)
**	    Modified old members and added new ones to support the integrity
**	    constraints (FIPS) project.  These structures will not be part of
**	    any hash buckets, so the standard header pointers will be re-used
**	    to hold pointers to next/previous linked list of session specific
**	    objects for unshared objects.  They will be unused by shared
**	    objects.  Added qso_monext, qso_moprev, qso_mobject, qso_psem_owner,
**	    qso_real_usage, and qso_decaying_usage.
**     05-nov-1993 (smc)
**          Bug #58635
**          Made l_reserved & owner elements PTR for consistency with DM_SVCB.
**	26-Sep-2003 (jenjo02)
**	    Deleted qso_psem, qso_psem_owner, added qso_excl_owner.
**	    Replaced qso_aeos structure with n/p pointers to QSF_AEO
**	    structures.
**	21-Feb-2005 (schka24)
**	    Deleted unused external-object stuff.
**	17-Feb-2009 (wanfr01)
**          Bug 121543
**	    Add QSOBJ_DBP_TYPE
**	26-May-2010 (kschendel) b123814

**	of float around loose inside QSF, and require no special tracking.
**	They do not participate in the QSF hash table, they aren't LRU'ed
**	out, there's no master, etc.
**
**	A named object has a master object header (a.k.a an "index" object)
**	for keeping track of the object.  The master holds the object and
**	object alias names (BE and FE names), and is used to hold the
**	object's position on a hash chain.  The object is always a QP
**	object, we don't share other kinds of objects (although QSF doesn't
**	really care about the object type much).  If the shared thing is a
**	set-input DB procedure, there can be multiple QP's connected to the
**	same master object.  (A set-input DBP QP is sensitive to the
**	size of the passed-in temp table, and QEF is able to choose the
**	most size-appropriate QP from multiple QP's belonging to the DBP.)
**	All the QP objects are created with the same object ID, and
**	one master is used to connect them all together.
**
**	Note that it's possible to have a non-shareable named object,
**	although it is rare.  (Named v5-style QUEL queries are not shared,
**	and some forms of repeated QUEL queries can't be shared.)
**
**	Mutex ordering:  master mutex > hash mutex > QSR mutex.

** Name: QSO_HASH_BKT - QSF object hash bucket.
**
** Description:
**      This structure defines a hash bucket used for hashing QSF objects.
**	An array of these hash buckets will be allocated at server startup time
**	to serve as the hash table.  The number of buckets in the table will be
**	dynamically chosen based on the amount of memory being used for the QSF
**	memory pool.
**
**      All named objects will be hashed into the server wide hash table.
**	Only named objects are hashed;  unnamed objects are purely private
**	to their owning session, and are manipulated by handle alone.
**	Named objects are typically shareable, and are the only objects
**	that can persist beyond end-of-query.
**
**	The hash bucket mutex is used to prevent create and delete
**	races and link foul-ups.
**	Mutex ordering:  master mutex > hash mutex > QSR mutex.

**	    Added the standard structure header, and the .qsr_streamid member.

**	05-jul-87 (thurston)
**	    Added the .qsr_tracing member.
**	28-nov-87 (thurston)
**	    Changed the SCF_SEMAPHORE to a CS_SEMAPHORE, to enable easier usage
**	    of CS{p,v}_semaphore() routines instead of going through SCF.
**	26-jan-88 (thurston)
**	    Removed the .qsr_ob1st and .qsr_oblast, replaced them with the hash
**	    table, .qsr_hashtbl, and a few other associated fields:
**	    .qsr_nbuckets, .qsr_object_lru, Also added some more statistical
**	    fields:  .qsr_memtot, .qsr_mxobjs, .qsr_bmaxobjs, .qsr_mxsess,
**	    .qsr_bkts_used, .qsr_mxbkts_used.
**	19-oct-1992 (rog)
**	    Removed qsr_se1st and added qsr_1st_lru, qsr_last_lru,
**	    qsr_no_unnamed, qsr_mx_unnamed, and qsr_psem_owner for better
**	    statistics, performance, and reliability.  Also added qsr_no_named,

**	    qsr_mx_rsize.
**	06-jan-1993 (rog)
