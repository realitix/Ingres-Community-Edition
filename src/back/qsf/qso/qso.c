/**
**
**  Name: QSO.C - QSF's Object Services Module.
**
**  Description:
**      This file contains all of the routines necessary
**      to perform the all of QSF's Object Services op-codes.
**      This includes the opcodes to create and destroy objects
**	from QSF's memory, lock and unlock objects, allocate
**	pieces for objects, set the root address of an object, etc.
** 
**      This file contains the following routines:
**
**          qso_create() - Create a QSF object.
**          qso_destroy() - Destroy a QSF object (by handle).
**          qso_destroyall() - Destroy all members of a multiple QSF object.
**          qso_lock() - Lock a QSF object exclusively or shared.
**          qso_unlock() - Unlock a QSF object.
**          qso_setroot() - Set the root address of a QSF object.
**          qso_info() - Get information about a QSF object.
**          qso_palloc() - Allocate memory pieces for a QSF object.
**          qso_gethandle() - Retrieve the handle for a named QSF object.
**          qso_getnext() - Retrieve the next handle of a multiple QSF object.
**	    qso_trans_or_define() - Translate or define an alias atomically
**	    qso_just_trans() - Translate an alias (but don't define it).
**          qso_chtype() - Change type of a QSF object.
**	    qso_rmvobj() - Remove an object from the object list.
**	    qso_ses_commit() - Commit named objects created by this session.
**
**      This file also contains the following internal routines, which are
**	declared "static" and are therefore not visible outside of this file:
**
**	    qso_rmvindex() - Remove an index master object.
**	    qso_wait_for() - Wait for an object in the process of being created.
**	    qso_mkobj() - Make an object, ie. low level of qso_create().
**	    qso_lknext() - Returns the next available lock id for QSF.
**	    qso_mkindex() - Add a master to the hash table.
**	    qso_find() - Find a QSO object with the given name and type.
**	    qso_lkset() - Actually locks the object.
**	    qso_hash() - Returns ptr to appropriate hash bucket for an obj ID.
**	    qso_nextbyhandle() - Internal function to find the next multiple QP
**				 based on a handle.
**
**
**  History:
**      06-mar-86 (thurston)    
**          Initial creation.
**      02-jun-86 (thurston)    
**	    Corrected bug in qso_setroot() where the routine always returned
**	    E_DB_ERROR even when there was no error.
**	24-jun-86 (thurston)
**	    Modified code to comply with new SCF_CB.  This affected all calls
**	    to SCU_WAIT and SCU_RELEASE.
**	23-feb-87 (thurston)
**	    Reversed all STRUCT_ASSIGN_MACRO's to conform with CL spec.
**	02-mar-87 (thurston)
**	    GLOBALDEF changes.
**	02-mar-87 (thurston)
**	    Added support for new type of QSF object: SQLDA.
**	16-mar-87 (stec)
**	    Added new interface qso_chtype.
**	12-may-87 (thurston)
**	    Added an xDEBUG section to qso_create() that dumps the QSF object
**	    queue whenever a request to create a named object is recieved.  This
**	    should ultimately become a trace point.
**	05-jul-87 (thurston)
**	    Added code to qso_create(), qso_rmvobj(), and qso_addobj() to check
**	    for server wide tracing before even attempting to look for a
**	    particular trace flag.
**	05-aug-87 (thurston)
**	    Changed interface to QSO_GETHANDLE to support object locking at
**	    get_handle time.  Added new low level object locker and modified
**	    QSO_LOCK to use it.
**	21-aug-87 (thurston)
**	    Speeded up the search for QSF object names in qso_find() by looking
**	    at first 8 bytes of name as two i4's.  This will avoid excessive
**	    calls to MEcmp(). 
**	28-nov-87 (thurston)
**	    Changed semaphore code to use CS calls instead of going through SCF.
**	20-jan-88 (eric)
**	    Added support for the QSO_TRANS_OR_DEFINE opcode.
**	29-jan-88 (thurston)
**	    Added support for the QSF hash table.
**	19-feb-88 (thurston)
**	    Checks in qso_lock() and qso_gethandle() for EXLOCKs on a QP have
**	    been modified to check for an EXLOCK on a "sharable" QP.
**	24-may-88 (eric)
**	    Added support for the QSO_JUST_TRANS opcode
**	20-dec-89 (ralph)
**	    QUANTUM BUG FIXES:
**	    Don't remove object if we have the only shared lock, but some
**	    other thread is waiting on the QP to be built in qso_just_trans
**	    or qso_trans_or_define (qso_destroy).
**	    Don't add alias objects to the LRU queue (qso_addobj).
**	    Return WASDEFINED if object is removed (qso_trans_or_define).
**	    Return UNKNOWN_OBJ if object is removed (qso_just_trans).
**	    Provide interface to lock QSF object in qso_trans_or_define and
**	    qso_just_trans.
**	06-jun-90 (andre)
**	    Made changes to allow creation of multiple aliases on QP objects.
**	    Added a new routine to create a new alias on an existing QP object
**	    (this will be different from TRANS_OR_DEFINE since we will expect
**	    the object to exist)
**	    Made changes to qso_rmvobj() to remove aliases iteratively, rather
**	    than recursively.
**	13-nov-91 (rog)
**	    Integrated 6.4 changes into 6.5.
**	28-aug-1992 (rog)
**	    Prototype QSF and silence compiler warnings.
**	08-Jan-1992 (fred)
**	    Added qso_associate() in support of peripheral object management.
**	30-nov-1992 (rog)
**	    Major changes in support of the multiple QP objects (FIPS), and new
**	    tuning and supportability improvements.  Include ulf.h before qsf.h.
**	08-mar-1993 (rog)
**	    Changed the interface to qso_mkobj() so that the scb is passed in
**	    to qso_mkobj(), which means that the function doesn't have to waste
**	    time getting the scb.
**	29-jun-1993 (rog)
**	    Include <tr.h> for the xDEBUGed TRdisplay()s.
**	14-jul-93 (ed)
**	    replacing <dbms.h> by <gl.h> <sl.h> <iicommon.h> <dbdbms.h>
**	 7-jan-94 (swm)
**	    Bug #58635
**	    Added PTR cast for qso_owner (which has changed type to PTR) in
**	    assignments and comparisons.
**	30-mar-94 (rickh)
**	    Object usage counts were pointing at an uninitialized area.
**	16-may-1994 (rog)
**	    Attach and detach named QP's to MO structures.
**	28-Apr-1995 (jenjo02)
**	    Combined CSi|n_semaphore functions calls into single
**	    CSw_semaphore call.
**	09-may-1996 (kch)
**	    In the function qso_hash(), we now check for DB_MAXNAME (32)
**	    characters in the object name as well as the first blank. This
**	    change fixes bug 75638.
**	09-jan-1997(angusm)
**	    Diagnostic and other changes relating to bug 76278.
**	    These treat the symptoms, not the root cause.
**	15-Aug-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Changed ulm_streamid from (PTR) to (PTR*) so that ulm
**	    can destroy those handles when the memory is freed.
**	19-Aug-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Distinguish between private and shared ULM streams.
**	    Piggyback ulm_palloc() calls with ulm_openstream() where appropriate.
**	19-nov-1998 (somsa01)
**	    In qso_trans_or_define() and qso_just_trans(), increment the
**	    wait status of an object that is found to let others know that
**	    the current session is using it.  (Bug #94216)
**	30-nov-1998 (somsa01)
**	    Removed previous change from qso_just_trans(); it is not needed
**	    there. Also, moved decrementation of qso_wait to AFTER the check
**	    of qso_psem_owner and qso_psem.
**	03-dec-1998 (somsa01)
**	    In qso_rmvobj(), if we are just removing the object from the
**	    list of objects attached to the master object, we need to also
**	    update the alias' pointer to the first object (if there is one).
**	    Also, moved the decrement of qso_wait to BEFORE the releasing
**	    of the qso_psem semaphore in qso_destroy(), qso_destroyall(),
**	    qso_unlock(), and qso_wait_for(). Also, removed some uneeded
**	    variables.  (Bug #94216)
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	10-Jan-2001 (jenjo02)
**	    qsf_session() function replaced with GET_QSF_CB macro,
**	    callers of QSF now must supply session's CS_SID in QSF_RCB
**	    (qsf_sid). qsf_call() guarantees that qsf_rb->qsf_scb
**	    contains QSF_CB* when these functions are invoked.
**	    Added QSF_CB* parameter to qsf_clrmem().
**	04-sep-2003 (abbjo03)
**	    Add missing declarations in xDEBUG sections.
**	26-Sep-2003 (jenjo02)
**	    Wholesale redesign to eliminate qsr_psem single point of
**	    contention. Hash lists and individual master objects are now
**	    mutexed. "waits" are done using CS_CONDITION objects
**	    instead of mutex blocks.
**	21-Feb-2005 (schka24)
**	    Remove deadwood.  Eliminate alias as a separate index object,
**	    caused races / segv's because find would find the alias
**	    on the hash chain just as destroy deleted master.  (Despite
**	    an andre-comment above, only one alias per master is allowed.)
**	    Prevent clrmem/clrmem and clrmem/destroyall races, and
**	    a rare create/create race.  Combine named destroy's into
**	    common routine. Attempt to update comments with recently
**	    hard-won knowledge.
**	    It's mildly amusing to note that these races were uncovered
**	    by a completely abusive named-object create/delete load,
**	    amounting to thousands per second among 16 sessions -- caused
**	    by a bug I put into DMF a year ago!
**	9-feb-2007 (kibro01) b113972
**	    Add parameter to qso_rmvobj to state whether we have a
**	    lock on the LRU queue
**	11-feb-2008 (smeke01) b113972
**	    Back out above change.
**	14-Nov-2008 (kiria01) b120998
**	    Handle GETHANDLE of proto-creates objects better - detect the
**	    oddity and the owner state & allow for it to be destroyed.
**	    Also added debugging stall point to aid multi-thread debugging.
**	22-May-2009 (kibro01) b122104
**	    Pass in scb so we can compare an unfinished object's scb against
**	    the excl_owner field to cater for the case where this session
**	    created the object, stopped before producing a query plan, and is
**	    now coming along with another object with the same text using
**	    dynamic query caching.
**	26-May-2010 (kschendel) b123814
**	    Add "session commit" and session-named-objects list so that
**	    uncommitted session-created named objects can be accurately
**	    rolled back if need be.  The old way depended on an object-session
**	    that could become stale and bogus.
**	29-Oct-2010 (jonj) SIR 120874
**	    Set error codes using SETDBERR.
**      28-Jun-2011 (horda03) b125486
**          Set length of qso_ascii_id for E_QS0021 to 0.
**      28-Jun-2011 (horda03) b125488
**          Need to release mater semaphore before calling qso_find.
**      28-Jun-2011 (horda03) b125489
**          Update the qso_status field when deleting an object to
**          prevent other sessions from doing the same, leading to
**          E_QS0021.
**      13-Jul-2011 (hanal04) SIR 125458
**          Update cs_elog calls inline with sc0e_putAsFcn changes.

/*{
** Name: QSO_CREATE - Create a QSF object.
**
** Description:
**      This is the entry point to the QSF QSO_CREATE routine. 
**	An object is created in QSF's memory space.  The object can
**	be named or unnamed.  An unnamed object is private to the
**	calling session, and indeed QSF adds little or no value for
**	unnamed objects.  Named objects however can be shared among
**	sessions, and can have a lifetime beyond one query lifetime.
**	The object that's created is marked with the QSF exclusive
**	lock, so that nobody else will be able to use it or delete it
**	until the object is unlocked (with QSO_UNLOCK).
**
**	You might expect that named objects are actually created here.
**	As it turns out, you would be wrong.  Certainly, named objects
**	CAN be created here, but they usually aren't.  Since the rest
**	of Ingres distinguishes between an internal (back-end) name
**	and an external (front-end or alias) name, what almost always
**	creates a shareable, named object is QSO_TRANS_OR_DEFINE.
**	Once the named object is created (via define), the creating
**	session will end up here, in QSO_CREATE.  What we'll do for
**	that specific case is exclusive-lock the object, as advertised
**	above, and simply hand it back to the caller.
**
**	At this point, there are only four types of objects that QSF will
**	store:  QTEXT (query text), QTREE (query tree), QP (query plan), and
**	SQLDA (used for `describe').
**
** Inputs:
**      QSO_CREATE                      Op code to qsf_call().
**      qsf_rb                          Request block.
**		.qsf_obj_id		Object id for the object to be
**					created.
**			.qso_type	The type of object this will be.
**					Must be one of the following:
**					    QSO_QTEXT_OBJ - query text
**					    QSO_QTREE_OBJ - query tree
**					    QSO_QP_OBJ    - query plan
**					    QSO_SQLDA_OBJ - SQLDA used for SQL's
**							    `describe' stmt.
**			.qso_lname	Length in bytes of the object name
**					given in .qso_name.  If zero, this
**					is an un-named object.
**			.qso_name	Name for the object (optional).
**                                      For named objects, the object id
**                                      must be unique and is defined by
**                                      the name and type of object.
**                                      Therefore, there can be up to
**                                      4 objects with the same name:
**                                      1 QTEXT, 1 QTREE, 1 QP, 1 SQLDA. 
**
** Outputs:
**      qsf_rb
**		.qsf_obj_id
**			.qso_handle	This will be the only part of
**                                      the object id used for the rest
**                                      of the QSF calls that work with
**                                      this object (except QSO_GETHANDLE,
**                                      which will return this).  This
**                                      is actually a pointer to the
**                                      object header, but should only
**                                      be used as an abstraction by the
**                                      calling routines. 
**		.qsf_lk_id		Since CREATE implies locking the object
**					exclusively, this will be set to the
**					lock id QSF assigns to the object.
**					This will be required whenever any form
**                                      of object modification is done through
**                                      the QSF routines (e.g. QSO_PALLOC,
**                                      QSO_SETROOT, etc.).
**		.qsf_error		Filled in with error if encountered.
**			.err_code	The QSF error that occurred.  One of:
**				E_QS0000_OK
**				    Operation succeeded.
**				E_QS0001_NOMEM
**				    Out of memory.
**				E_QS0009_BAD_OBJTYPE
**				    Illegal object type.
**				E_QS000A_OBJ_ALREADY_EXISTS
**				    An object of this name and type
**				    already exists.
**				E_QS000B_BAD_OBJNAME
**				    Illegal object name.
**                              E_QS000C_ULM_ERROR
**                                  Unexpected ULM error.
**                              E_QS000D_CORRUPT
**                                  QSF's internal structures got crunched.
**                              E_QS001C_EXTRA_OBJECT
**				    A QP object was added to a chain of QP
**				    objects.
**
**	Returns:
**	    E_DB_OK
**	    E_DB_WARN
**	    E_DB_ERROR
**	    E_DB_FATAL
**
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**          Other facilities and sessions will now "see" this
**	    object just created, since an object header will
**	    be set up for it and entered into the object queue and
**          the object hash table.  QSF will guarantee, however, that
**	    other callers will not be able to get access to this object
**	    via QSO_LOCK until the proper QSO_UNLOCK has been done.
**
** History:
**	06-mar-86 (thurston)
**          Initial creation.
**	24-jun-86 (thurston)
**	    Modified code to comply with new SCF_CB.  This affected the call
**	    to SCU_WAIT and SCU_RELEASE.
**	02-mar-87 (thurston)
**	    Added support for new type of QSF object: SQLDA.
**	12-may-87 (thurston)
**	    Added an xDEBUG section that dumps the QSF object queue whenever
**	    a request to create a named object is recieved.  This should
**	    ultimately become a trace point.
**	05-jul-87 (thurston)
**	    Added code to check for server wide tracing before even attempting
**	    to look for a particular trace flag.
**	28-nov-87 (thurston)
**	    Changed semaphore code to use CS calls instead of going through SCF.
**	20-jan-88 (eric)
**	    Took the guts out and made into qso_mkobj(). This allows 
**	    qso_trans_or_define() to use the same code.
**	27-dec-88 (jrb)
**	    Added code to check return status from qso_mkobj to avoid accvio
**	    when ulm fails in it.
**	28-aug-1992 (rog)
**	    Change for(;;) to do/while(0) to silence compiler warning.
**	30-nov-1992 (rog)
**	    Changes to support master objects and multiple QP's.  Also, set the

/*{
** Name: QSO_DESTROY - Destroy a QSF object.
**
** Description:
**      This is the entry point to the QSF QSO_DESTROY routine. 
**      This opcode is used to destroy a QSF object from QSF's
**      memory space.  The object is specified by its handle (address),
**	so either named or unnamed objects can be destroyed.
**	In either case, though, some sort of lock has to be in place
**	on the object, or an error occurs.  Typically it will be a
**	shared lock for a named object, and it must be an exclusive
**	lock for an unnamed object.
**
**      The memory freed up by this action will go back into QSF's
**      memory pool to be recycled again when another object gets
**      created or needs more memory.  This memory will not get released
**      to SCF again (via ULM), until QSF is terminated for the
**      server.
**
** Inputs:
**      QSO_DESTROY                     Op code to qsf_call().
**      qsf_rb                          Request block.
**              .qsf_obj_id             Object id for the object to be
**                                      destroyed.
**                      .qso_handle     Handle for the object.
**					The remainder of scf_obj_id is
**					irrelevant.
**              .qsf_lk_id              The lock id QSF assigned to this object
**					when it was exclusively locked.
**					(Not needed if it's a named object
**					which is share-locked.)
**
** Outputs:
**      qsf_rb                          Request block.
**              .qsf_error		Filled in with error if encountered.
**                      .err_code	The QSF error that occurred.  One of:
**                              E_QS0000_OK
**				    Operation succeeded.
**                              E_QS000F_BAD_HANDLE
**				    Supplied handle does not refer to an object.
**				E_QS0010_NO_EXLOCK
**				    You don't have exclusive access to object.
**				E_QS0011_ULM_STREAM_NOT_CLOSED
**				    ULM would not close the memory stream for
**				    this session.
**				E_QS001B_NO_SESSION_CB
**				    Could not find the current session.
**				E_QS001D_NOT_OWNER
**				    Session tried destroy an object that it
**				    does not own.
**      Returns:
**          E_DB_OK
**          E_DB_WARN
**          E_DB_ERROR
**          E_DB_FATAL
**
**      Exceptions:
**          none
**
** Side Effects:
**          Other facilities and sessions will no longer be able to
**          find the object that was destroyed.
**
** History:
**      06-mar-86 (thurston)
**          Initial creation.
**	24-jun-86 (thurston)
**	    Modified code to comply with new SCF_CB.  This affected the call
**	    to SCU_WAIT and SCU_RELEASE.
**	28-nov-87 (thurston)
**	    Changed semaphore code to use CS calls instead of going through SCF.
**	20-jan-87 (eric)
**	    Changed to allow callers to destroy objects with only a shared
**	    lock on it. This means support for deferred destroys elsewhere.
**	    This is needed by the QSO_TRANS_OR_DEFINE opcode, since we want
**	    users to wait until shared QP's are finished being built.
**	31-mar-89 (jrb)
**	    Fixed two bugs here: we were allowing objects to be destroyed when
**	    the caller had a mismatching lock id and when the object was not
**	    locked at all.
**	20-dec-89 (ralph)
**	    Don't remove object if we have the only shared lock, but some
**	    other thread is waiting on the QP to be built in qso_just_trans
**	    or qso_trans_or_define.
**	06-jun-90 (andre)
**	    make sure that the object being destroyed is NOT an alias;
**	28-aug-1992 (rog)
**	    Change for(;;) to do/while(0) to silence compiler warning.
**	30-oct-1992 (rog)
**	    Added the owner to the semaphore, and reworked aliases.  Added
**	    support for master objects.
**	03-mar-1994 (rog)
**	    If we mark an object for deferred destroy, then we need to destroy
**	    the object's alias.
**	16-may-1994 (rog)
**	    When destroying a named object, detach it from MO, too.
**	03-dec-1998 (somsa01)
**	    Moved decrementation of qso_wait to BEFORE releaseing the qso_psem
**	    semaphore.
**	22-Feb-2005 (schka24)
**	    Extract named-object destroyer.
**      17-feb-09 (wanfr01) b121543
**          Add QSOBJ_DBP_TYPE as valid qso_type

/*
** Name: qso_destroy_one -- Destroy one named object
**
** Description:
**	This routine does the common work for QSO_DESTROY and
**	QSO_DESTROYALL when applied to named objects.  (QSO_DESTROY
**	is a destroy-by-handle, QSO_DESTROYALL is in effect a destroy-
**	by-name.)
**
**	If the object being destroyed is still in use by some other
**	session, or is being waited on by another session, it's
**	marked for deferred deletion and we just exit (after counting
**	off an unlock for ourselves).
**
**	Destroying an object requires care if races are to be avoided.
**	The objects we're dealing with here are (typically) shareable,
**	and so multiple sessions might try to delete the same object at
**	the same time.  The interesting cases are:
**
**	1) two sessions both using a shared object, both decide to
**	destroy it using DESTROY.
**	This situation is detected because before an object can be
**	destroyed (by handle), it has to be share-locked.  If some
**	object is locked by multiple sessions, or if there are sessions
**	still waiting for the object to be completed, we just mark the
**	object for deferred destroy.  The last session looking at the object
**	does the actual remove.
**
**	2) Session A decides to DESTROY an object, session B is in the
**	middle of memory reclamation (clrmem).
**	This actually isn't a problem, because clrmem refuses to consider an
**	object that is locked (or has waiters).  As long as we're careful
**	to not make the object look unlocked until we set the LRU-destroy
**	flag, we're ok.
**
**	3) Sessions A and B are both doing clrmem and they manage to consider
**	the same object simultaneously.
**	Won't happen, because clrmem makes its choice while holding the QSF
**	mutex.  When it picks an object, it turns on an LRU-destroy flag
**	that prevents the other session from picking the object.
**
**	4) Session A is doing a DESTROYALL while session B is in clrmem.
**	This one is a bit tricky.  DESTROYALL basically does "lookup by
**	object ID, then delete" repeatedly until the object ID isn't found
**	any more.  We have to plug races at several points.
**	First, two mechanisms prevent races between qso_find and clrmem.
**	When qso_find considers a master, it mutexes, it, and verifies
**	its type.  Object removal mutexes the master and clears its type
**	before it unmutexes it.  qso_find also increments a hash bucket
**	indicator while it's searching.  Object removal can't actually
**	delete the master until the indicator is cleared.  Taken together,
**	find is prevented from finding an object undergoing removal, and
**	remove is prevented from completing the removal until we're sure
**	that nobody is in the middle of trying to find it.
**
**	Second, once DESTROYALL chooses an object, it sets and checks the
**	same LRU-destroy flag that clrmem uses.  If B has already picked
**	the object for deletion, A won't delete it also.  (And if B is
**	sufficiently far along with deletion, A won't find the object at
**	all, viz. the prior paragraph.)
**
**	One other QSF strangeness to handle here is the case of a QP
**	object that was created with QSO_TRANS_OR_DEFINE, but the
**	definition was never completed.  To prevent premature culling,
**	trans-or-define marks the object as waiting, in a funny unlocked
**	state.  We'll recognize that state and do a sort of pseudo-unlock,
**	so that we don't wait for some nonexistent other session to do
**	the destroy.
**
** Inputs:
**	obj			QSO_OBJ_HDR object to be destroyed
**	master_p		QSO_MASTER_HDR ** passed as NULL if caller is
**				destroy-by-handle.  If non-null, caller
**				is DESTROYALL, and the master is mutexed.
**	qsf_rb			QSF_RCB original destroy request block
**	err_code		Pointer to error code (caller presets to OK)
**
** Outputs:
**	Returns usual DB_STATUS.
**	master_p		Updated to NULL if we removed the master;
**				if master still there, is unmutexed.
**	err_code		May be updated if there's a screw-up
**
** Side Effects:

**	    Extract from destroy/destroyall;  more delete-race squashing.
**      24-May-2011 (maspa05) b125120
**          If qso_rmvobj failed due to another session still locking it
**          then unset QSO_LRU_DESTROY and set QSO_DEFFERRED_DESTROY 
**          instead. This will mean it gets removed when the last session
**          unlocks it.

/*{
** Name: QSO_LOCK - Lock a QSF object exclusively or shared.
**
** Description:
**      This is the entry point to the QSF QSO_LOCK routine. 
**      This opcode is used to lock a QSF object for either exclusive or
**	shared access.  If the object is to be exclusively locked, QSF will
**	assign, and hand back to the caller, a lock id that will be required
**      whenever a QSO_PALLOC, QSO_SETROOT, QSO_UNLOCK, etc. is used.
**
**	This routine also returns the root address of the locked object to the
**	caller so they can find their way about the object.
**
**	While you might imagine from the name that QSO_LOCK waits for
**	the appropriate access to the object, you would be mistaken.
**	QSO_LOCK simply sets the desired lock state into the object
**	header.  If the object is not in a state in which the lock
**	request can be satisfied, an error is returned.
**
**	Named, shareable QP objects may not be exclusively locked.
**	In fact, using QSO_LOCK for a shareable object is probably a
**	bad idea, unless the object is already marked as non-grabbable in
**	some other manner.  The proper way to get a shareable object handle
**	is with QSO_GETHANDLE or _GETNEXT, both of which have the
**	ability to lock the object as it's fetched.
**
** Inputs:
**      QSO_LOCK                        Op code to qsf_call().

**		.qsf_obj_id		Object id.
**			.qso_handle	Handle for the object to lock.
**		.qsf_lk_state		Type of lock being asked for.  One of:
**					    QSO_SHLOCK - Lock for sharing.
**					    QSO_EXLOCK - Lock exclusively.
**
** Outputs:
**      qsf_rb
**		.qsf_root 		The root address for the locked object.
**		.qsf_lk_id		If object is being locked for shared
**                                      access, this will not be touched.  If
**					locking exclusively, this will be set to
**					the lock id QSF assigns to the object.
**					This will be required whenever any form
**                                      of object modification is done through
**                                      the QSF routines (e.g. QSO_PALLOC,

**          access, the number of share locks on that object will be
**          incremented.  If this number had been zero, the object will be taken

/*{
** Name: QSO_SETROOT - Set the root address of a QSF object.
**
** Description:
**      This is the entry point to the QSF QSO_SETROOT routine. 
**      This opcode is used to assign an address as the "root" address
**	for a QSF object.  This address should be a pointer to some form
**	of root node, or other structure, from which, one can traverse
**	the entire object. In other words, this "root" is the "entrance"
**	to all memory "tagged" by the object id.
**
**	The root of an object will be given out to callers by the
**	QSO_INFO opcode, which is how different facilities and
**	sessions will be able to share QSF objects.
**
**      This opcode will only be legal while the object is exclusively locked,
**	and the caller can supply the proper lock id.
**
**	Note that QSF itself doesn't care much about the object root,
**	although it does use the lack of a root to mean that the object
**	is not yet completely constructed (and therefore can be considered
**	to be exclusively locked -- even if it isn't!)
**
** Inputs:
**      QSO_SETROOT                     Op code to qsf_call().
**      qsf_rb                          Request block.
**		.qsf_obj_id		Object id.
**			.qso_handle	The object's handle.
**		.qsf_root		The address to set as the root
**					address to this object.
**		.qsf_lk_id		The lock id QSF assigned to this object
**					when you locked it exclusively.
**
** Outputs:
**      qsf_rb                          Request block.
**		.qsf_error		Filled in with error if encountered.
**			.err_code	The QSF error that occurred.  One of:
**                              E_QS0000_OK
**				    Operation succeeded.
**                              E_QS000F_BAD_HANDLE
**				    Supplied handle does not refer to an object.
**				E_QS0010_NO_EXLOCK
**				    You don't have exclusive access to object.

**	    E_DB_WARN
**	    E_DB_ERROR

**
**	Exceptions:

**
** Side Effects:

**          object will now be given the new root address.
**
** History:
**	06-mar-86 (thurston)
**          Initial creation.
**	02-jun-86 (thurston)
**	    Corrected bug where routine always returned E_DB_ERROR even when

**	24-jun-86 (thurston)
**	    Modified code to comply with new SCF_CB.  This affected the call
**	    to SCU_WAIT and SCU_RELEASE.

/*{
** Name: QSO_GETHANDLE - Retrieve the handle for a named QSF object.
**
** Description:
**      This is the entry point to the QSF QSO_GETHANDLE routine. 
**      This opcode is used to retrieve the handle for a named QSF object
**	when all you know is that object's name.  The handle is the method of
**	telling all of the other QSF routines what object you are referring to.
**
**	In addition to retrieving the object handle, we'll lock the
**	object according to the lock type indicated by the caller.
**	This is necessary, as unlocked named objects are subject to
**	reclaim at any time by other sessions.  It would be unfortunate
**	to have the object vanish out from under the caller.
**	The correct lock type is always or nearly always QSO_SHLOCK,
**	asking for a shared lock.  (Exclusive locks on sharable QP
**	objects are not allowed, except when the object is being
**	created -- and that's not the case here.)
**
**	Note that a GETNEXT call with no initial object handle is equivalent
**	to a GETHANDLE call asking for a shared lock.
**
**	This routine does not wait for the shared QP to finish being
**	created.  I think we get away with this because if this isn't the
**	creating session, the only way another session is supposed to know
**	the object ID is through a translation, and both the the translating
**	entry points do a wait-for.  Kinda scary though. (schka24)
**
** Inputs:
**      QSO_GETHANDLE                   Op code to qsf_call().
**      qsf_rb                          Request block.
**		.qsf_obj_id		Object id.
**			.qso_type	The type of object to look for.
**					Must be one of the following:
**					    QSO_QTEXT_OBJ - query text
**					    QSO_QTREE_OBJ - query tree
**					    QSO_QP_OBJ    - query plan
**					    QSO_SQLDA_OBJ - SQLDA used for SQL's
**							    `describe' stmt.
**					(Although the above is correct in
**					theory, in practice only QP objects
**					are ever named.)
**			.qso_lname	Length in bytes of the object name
**					given in .qso_name.
**			.qso_name	Name for the object.
**                                      For named objects, the object id
**                                      must be unique and is defined by
**                                      the name and type of object.
**                                      Therefore, there can be up to
**                                      4 objects with the same name:
**                                      1 QTEXT, 1 QTREE, 1 QP, 1 SQLDA.
**		.qsf_lk_state		Type of lock being asked for.  One of:
**					    QSO_SHLOCK - Lock for sharing.
**					    QSO_EXLOCK - Lock exclusively.
**						(probably a Bad Idea)
**
** Outputs:
**      qsf_rb                          Request block.
**		.qsf_obj_id		Object id.
**			.qso_handle	The object's handle.
**		.qsf_root 		The root address for the locked object.
**		.qsf_lk_id		If object is being locked for shared
**                                      access, this will not be touched.  If
**					locking exclusively, this will be set to
**					the lock id QSF assigns to the object.
**					This will be required whenever any form
**                                      of object modification is done through
**                                      the QSF routines (e.g. QSO_PALLOC,
**                                      QSO_SETROOT, etc.).
**		.qsf_error		Filled in with error if encountered.
**			.err_code	The QSF error that occurred.  One of:
**                              E_QS0000_OK
**				    Operation succeeded.
**				E_QS0009_BAD_OBJTYPE

**	28-aug-1992 (rog)
**	    Change for(;;) to do/while(0) to silence compiler warning.
**	30-oct-1992 (rog)
**	    Added the owner to the semaphore, removed aliases, and added

**	30-mar-94 (rickh)
**	    Object usage counts were pointing at an uninitialized area.
**	22-Feb-2005 (schka24)

/*{
** Name: QSO_GETNEXT - Retrieve the handle for the next named QSF object.
**
** Description:
**
**      This is the entry point to the QSF QSO_GETNEXT function. 
**	This opcode takes as input the handle of the query plan that the
**	requestor is looking at and returns the next query plan related to
**	this query if it exists.  Otherwise, it returns a warning status
**	with the error code set to E_QS0019_UNKNOWN_OBJ.
**
**	If the handle is NULL, then QSO_GETNEXT returns the first query plan
**	with the given object type/name, using shared locking.
**
**	The object will be locked with a shared lock, and the root address
**	will be returned.  Objects that are exclusively locked or whose root
**	has not been set will be "invisible" to QSO_GETNEXT.
**	After the object to be returned is locked, the shared lock on the
**	previous object (whose handle was passed in) is released.  This order
**	is important to prevent objects from being deleted out from under
**	the requesting session.
**
**	Most named objects only have one object per name.  The exception case
**	is set-input database procedures, which can have multiple QP's
**	attached to the same master index object, all with the same name.
**
**	Note that we do a wait-for on the object to be returned.  This
**	is actually somewhat logical, if awkward.  Normally we only need
**	to wait-for an object when we first access it, via an alias
**	translation (trans-or-define or just-trans).  (That is why the
**	gethandle operation doesn't wait-for.)  Now, though, we're
**	going after the next QP in the list, and we haven't waited-for
**	that one yet.  So we had better do so.

/*{
** Name: QSO_TRANS_OR_DEFINE - Translate or define an alias to an object.
**
** Description:
**      This is the entry point to the QSF QSO_TRANS_OR_DEFINE routine. 
**      This opcode is used to either translate or define an alias to 
**	a QSF QP object in QSF's memory space to be shared by other facilities, 
**	and shared between sessions.  If an object with the given alias
**	already exists, we'll return the real object id.  If no such
**	object exists, we'll create one using the real object ID passed in.
**
**	An alias is not an object.  It's another name for a QSF object.
**	(It's not entirely clear to me why QSF callers need two names
**	for the same thing, but there you are.)
**	The QSO_ALIAS_OBJ object type never applies to a real object,
**	it's only used to distinguish alias ID's from real ID's.
**
**	If the caller does not pass a lock request (i.e. if QSO_FREE
**	is passed), and a translation is found (as opposed to a new
**	definition), be aware that the handle returned (if found) MAY NOT
**	be touched!  The *only* part of the returned info that is valid
**	on a successful QSO_FREE translation is the name info (type, lname,
**	and the name itself).  The QP object that the alias pointed to
**	may be fair game for reclamation, and might be gone even before
**	we make it out of this routine.
**
**	If we find a translation, and it looks like the object is still
**	being constructed, we'll wait for it to be available.
**
**	If a new object is defined, even if the caller indicates QSO_FREE,
**	we hack up the newly defined object so that it won't be reclaimed:
**	waiters is incremented, and the "exclusive owner" is set to us.
**	For this case, it is OK to use the returned object handle.
**	What will ultimately happen in the normal course of events is a
**	QSO_CREATE asking for the object ID;  create will find our defined
**	object and just hand it back, after marking its lock state EXCL.
**	Then, assuming all goes well, someone will QSO_UNLOCK the object
**	which is where the waiter count is decremented back to normal.
**	If something bad happens, the QSO_DESTROY routines know about this
**	weird object state (unlocked with nonzero waiter), and deal with
**	it properly.
**
** Inputs:
**	QSO_TRANS_OR_DEFINE             Op code to qsf_call().

**			.qso_name	Name for the object.
**                                      For named objects, the object id
**                                      must be unique and is defined by

** Side Effects:

**	    on the underlying QP.
**
** History:
**	18-jan-88 (eric)
**          Initial creation.
**	03-jan-90 (ralph)
**	    Corrected quantum bugs:
**		- Allow lock to be set if WASTRANSLATED returned
**		- Return WASDEFINED if object was translated but removed
**	28-aug-1992 (rog)
**	    Change for(;;) to do/while(0) to silence compiler warning.
**	30-oct-1992 (rog)
**	    Reworked aliases, and added the owner to the semaphores.  Added
**	    support for master objects.
**	03-mar-1994 (rog)
**	    If qso_wait_for() says that the object was destroyed, we need
**	    to recheck the hash table to look for the object in case someone
**	    is rebuilding the QP before we got a chance to.
**	16-may-1994 (rog)
**	    Attach new aliases to the MO structures and save the first QP's
**	    handle in the alias's QSO_OBID.
**	19-nov-1998 (somsa01)
**	    If we find the object, bump up it's wait status to let others
**	    know that this session is using it.  (Bug #94216)
**	03-dec-1998 (somsa01)
**	    Removed previous changes; they have been reworked for bug 94216.
**	31-oct-2007 (dougi)
**	    trans_or_define() also works on text objects (for cached dynamic).
**      28-Jun-2011 (horda03) b125488

/*{
** Name: QSO_JUST_TRANS - Translate an alias to an object (but don't define).
**
** Description:
**      This is the entry point to the QSF QSO_JUST_TRANS routine. 
**      This opcode is used to translate an alias to 
**	a QSF QP object in QSF's memory space to be shared by other facilities, 
**	and shared between sessions. If the alias does not exist, then
**	an error is returned rather than defining the alias.
**
**	An alias is not an object.  It's another name for a QSF object.
**	The QSO_ALIAS_OBJ object type never applies to a real object,
**	it's only used to distinguish alias ID's from real ID's.
**
**	If the caller does not pass a lock request (i.e. if QSO_FREE
**	is passed), be aware that the handle returned (if found) MAY NOT
**	be touched!  The *only* part of the returned info that is valid
**	on a successful QSO_FREE translation is the name info (type, lname,
**	and the name itself).  The QP object that the alias pointed to
**	may be fair game for reclamation, and might be gone even before
**	we make it out of this routine.
**
**	If we find a translation, and it looks like the object is still
**	being constructed, we'll wait for it to be available.
**
** Inputs:
**	QSO_JUST_TRANS			Op code to qsf_call().
**      qsf_rb                          Request block.
**		.qsf_feobj_id		The FE Object id to be used as the 
**					source of the translation.
**			.qso_type	The type of object this will be.
**					It must be:
**					    QSO_ALIAS_OBJ - An alias.
**			.qso_lname	Length in bytes of the object name
**					given in .qso_name.
**			.qso_name	Name for the object which consists of
**					a string and two i4's. The esql
**					compilier must ensure that this is
**					unique.
**		.qsf_lk_state		Type of lock being asked for.  One of:
**					    QSO_FREE   - No lock requested.
**					    QSO_SHLOCK - Lock for sharing.
**					    QSO_EXLOCK - Lock exclusively.
**					Note: The object is locked only if
**					WASTRANSLATED is returned.
**
** Outputs:
**      qsf_rb
**		.qsf_obj_id	If a translation for the qsf_feobj_id
**				exists then this will hold the destination
**				of the translation. If a translation needs to
**				be defined then this will remain unchanged. In
**				either case, qsf_obj_id will hold the DBMS id
**				that qsf_feobj_id translates to after this
**				operation is complete.

**					    QSO_QP_OBJ    - query plan
**			.qso_lname	Length in bytes of the object name

**			.qso_handle	The object's handle.  Valid only
**					if WASTRANSLATED is returned and
**					qsf_lk_state was not set to QSO_FREE.
**		.qsf_t_or_d		This tells the caller that a 
**					translation or happened.
**					It will hold QSO_WASTRANSLATED.

/*{
** Name: QSO_CHTYPE - Change type of a QSF object.
**
** Description:
**      This is the entry point to the QSF QSO_CHTYPE routine. 
**      This opcode is used to change the type of a QSF object.
**
**      This opcode will only be legal while the object is exclusively locked,
**	and the caller can supply the proper lock id.
**
**	The only (current) usage of this operation is to change a
**	QP object into a QTREE object, for CREATE TABLE AS SELECT and
**	the dgtt variant.  When CREATE parsing starts, the parser thinks
**	that a typical non-QP DDL statement is coming, but to allow the
**	subselect to be properly optimized, the parse result has to be
**	a QTREE object.  In no case do we change the type of a named object.
**
** Inputs:
**      QSO_CHTYPE			Op code to qsf_call().
**      qsf_rb                          Request block.
**		.qsf_obj_id		Object id.
**			.qso_handle	The object's handle.
**			.qso_type	The new type for the object; must
**					be one of the following:
**					    QSO_QTEXT_OBJ - query text
**					    QSO_QTREE_OBJ - query tree
**					    QSO_QP_OBJ    - query plan
**					    QSO_SQLDA_OBJ - SQLDA used for SQL's
**							    `describe' stmt.
**			.qso_lname	Length of the object name.  Must be
**					zero, as only unnamed objects may have
**					their type changed.
**		.qsf_lk_id		The lock id QSF assigned to this object
**					when you locked it exclusively.
**
** Outputs:
**      qsf_rb                          Request block.
**		.qsf_error		Filled in with error if encountered.
**			.err_code	The QSF error that occurred.  One of:
**                              E_QS0000_OK
**				    Operation succeeded.
**				E_QS0009_BAD_OBJTYPE
**				    Supplied object type is invalid.
**				E_QS000A_OBJ_ALREADY_EXISTS
**				    Object with spec'd name,type already exists.
**                              E_QS000F_BAD_HANDLE
**				    Supplied handle does not refer to an object.
**				E_QS0010_NO_EXLOCK
**				    You don't have exclusive access to object.
**
**	Returns:
**	    E_DB_OK

/*{
** Name: qso_rmvobj - Remove an object from QSF.
**
** Description:
**	Removes the object from QSF, and, if necessary, destroys the master
**	object that owns the object.
**
**	There are three slight call variants:
**	master_p == NULL - this is a call to delete a named or unnamed
**	object from the outside (qs0_clrmem) (currently, always a named
**	object).  Need to mutex the object master and make sure that the
**	object is still available for deleting.
**
**	master_p != NULL but *master_p == NULL - delete an unnamed object
**
**	master_p != NULL and *master_p != NULL - delete a named object,
**	we already hold the master mutex and it's OK to go ahead with the
**	deletion.  If the master doesn't disappear, the master mutex
**	remains held throughout and at exit.
**
**	If we remove a master, before releasing the master mutex,
**	the master header type is cleared so that qso_find won't see
**	this master after we release the mutex.  Also, if there's someone
**	in qso_find on the master's hash bucket, the actual delete
**	of the master will stall until the finder is out of qso_find.
**	These two precautions (actually, taken in qso_rmvindex) ensure
**	that there are no fatal find-vs delete races.
**
** Inputs:
**      qso_obj			Pointer to the QSO_OBJ_HDR.
**	master_p		QSO_MASTER_HDR **, pointer to master.
**				This is nulled out if we remove the master.
**	errcode			An output
**
** Outputs:
**	errcode			Detailed error code if any
**
**	Returns:
**	    E_DB_OK, E_DB_FATAL
**
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	    Removes the object from QSF, so all others will no longer see it.
**
** History:
**	29-apr-86 (thurston)
**          Initial creation.
**	05-jul-87 (thurston)
**	    Added code to check for server wide tracing before even attempting
**	    to look for a particular trace flag.
**	22-jan-88 (eric)
**	    Added support for QSO_TRANS_OR_DEFINE. This involved automatically
**	    destroying alias' when QP's are destroyed. Also, this routine now
**	    destroys the objects ULM memory stream.
**	08-jan-1992 (fred)
**	    Added support for destroying associated objects as part of
**	    destroying the base object.
**	30-oct-1992 (rog)
**	    Reworked support for aliases and simplified the function.  Also
**	    added support for master objects.
**	15-jan-1993 (rog)
**	    Make sure to remove all objects from the session's orphan list.
**	09-jul-1993 (rog)
**	    Call CSr_semaphore() to release object's the semaphore.
**	09-jan-1997(angusm)
**	    Diagnostic and other changes relating to bug 76278.
**	    Since AEO functionality is not used, prevent AEO cleanup
**	06-mar-1996 (nanpr01)
**	    Initialize the pointers to null after freeing the memory. 
**	03-dec-1998 (somsa01)
**	    If we are just removing the object from the list of objects
**	    attached to the master object, we need to also update the
**	    alias' pointer to the first object (if there is one).
**	    (Bug #94216)
**	21-Oct-2003 (jenjo02)
**	    When called externally from qs0_clrobj() (master_p == NULL),
**	    sanity check the object, recheck it for
**	    removability after acquiring Master's mutex.
**	24-Feb-2005 (schka24)
**	    Maintain object size stats here.
**	2-Mar-2005 (schka24)
**	    Avoid dereferencing an obsolete session list pointer, it can't
**	    be meaningful unless the object is private to the session.
**      13-apr-2005 (huazh01)
**          Modify the fix for b111006, INGSRV2535. After including the
**          fix for b112813, INGSRV2931, it is no longer necessary to 
**          request Qsr_scb->qsr_psem because its caller routine, 
**          qsf_clrmem(), already holds such mutex. 
**          This fixes b114290, INGSRV3245.
**      17-feb-09 (wanfr01) b121543
**          Remove the object from the appropriate IMA list as determined by
**	    the QSF object's qso_type
**	26-May-2010 (kschendel) b123814
**	    If a named object, see if it's on the session
**	    uncommitted list, if so take it off.

/**
** Name: qso_mkobj - Make an object and add it to the object list.
**
** Description:
**	This makes an object and adds it to the list of all objects in QSF, 
**	and increments the number of objects in that list.
**	The object is initialized into EXLOCK lock state, so that the
**	caller has exclusive control at the beginning.  (And, so that the
**	memory grabber won't reclaim it prematurely.)
**
**	There are various cases:
**	Creating an unnamed object: *hash is irrelevant, *master should
**	be null.
**
**	Creating a new named object (no existing master):  *hash should
**	be supplied, and hash bucket should be mutexed.  *master should
**	be null upon entry, will be supplied (and mutexed) at exit.
**
**	Adding another object to an existing master:  *hash should be null,
**	and *master should be supplied.  Master should be mutexed at entry.
**
**	If we had to reclaim memory, and we're creating a named object,
**	it may turn out that someone else created the object while we
**	were off doing the reclaim.  When this happens, we return E_DB_INFO
**	to notify the caller, who may need to take special action.
**	Aside from the E_DB_INFO, all the other returned stuff is as
**	normal (out_obj, master filled in, master mutex held).
**
** Inputs:
**	new_objid	This is the object id for the new object to be created.
**	blksz		block size for the QSF object to be created
**	hash		QSO_HASH_BKT ** pointer to hash bucket ptr where we'll
**			hang the object's master.  Only relevant if it's a
**			brand new named object (no existing master).
**	master		QSO_MASTER_OBJ ** pointer to master ptr for named
**			objects, see above.
** Outputs:
**	out_obj		This will hold the pointer to the new object.
**	err_code	If qso_mkobj() does not return E_DB_OK then err_code
**			will hold an error code for explaination. If qso_mkobj()
**			returns E_DB_OK then err_code will remain unchanged.
**
**	Returns:
**	    E_DB_OK, E_DB_INFO, E_DB_FATAL
**
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	    Adds the object to the object list, so all others will now see it.
**
** History:
**	18-jan-88 (eric)
**          Initial creation, stolen from qso_create actually.
**	29-jan-88 (thurston)
**	    Now clears the LRU bit on an object when it is locked.
**	08-Jan-1992 (fred)
**	    Added initialization of the qso_aeo_* fields.
**	30-nov-1992 (rog)
**	    Added support for master objects and the new accounting info.
**	08-mar-1993 (rog)
**	    Added the scb argument as passed in to qso_mkobj() for better 
**	    performance.
**	09-jul-1993 (rog)
**          Initialize semaphore by calling CSi_semaphore() instead of just
**	    zeroing out bytes.  Also, name the semaphore.
**	28-mar-1994 (rog)
**          Initialize qso_size.
**	22-Feb-2005 (schka24)
**	    Need to re-search after clrmem if named insert.  Deal with
**	    situation where mkindex had to clrmem and then found the
**	    desired object.  Don't set master's qsmo_type until after we
**	    get past all the clrmem poop and are safely holding the master
**	    mutex again.
**	26-May-2010 (kschendel) b123814
**	    Put named objects on a session list headed in the qsf-cb
**	    for easier / more accurate delete when the objects are
**	    rolled-back instead of committed.

**      counter would overflow, it is recycled to the lowest possible value.
**      Note that there is a chance that someone could get the same lock id, 
**      therefore, but even if this happens, all it means is that they could 
**      accidently unlock someone elses exclusively locked object.  Since 
**      choosing a random number could do the same thing, it is felt that this 
**      method is sufficient.
**
**
** Inputs:
**      none
**
** Outputs:
**      none
**
**	Returns:
**	    Returns a i4  which is the lock id.

/**
** Name: qso_mkindex - Create a new stub master header
**
** Description:
**	A new master index header is created and linked into the hash
**	chain.  The master is partially initialized, although the
**	standard header "type" is zeroed out.  The caller has to fix
**	qsmo_type eventually.  Reason:  the caller may have to do a
**	clrmem, necessitating dropping mutexes, and we don't want anyone
**	to find this master until the caller is ready.
**
**	The caller specifies the hash bucket to link the new master to,
**	and is holding the hash mutex.  If we need to reclaim memory,
**	we'll drop the hash mutex and reverify that the named master
**	still doesn't exist before trying again.  Upon exit, the
**	master mutex is locked.
**
**	If we have to reclaim memory, and someone else manages to create
**	the object ID that we were originally looking for, this
**	routine returns E_DB_INFO with the object handle filled into
**	the object id.  (and the master mutex held.)
**
** Inputs:
**	objid		Pointer to the object ID that we need a master for.
**			Can be an output.
**      scb		Session Control Block that is requesting the master.
**	hash		QSO_HASH_BKT ** pointer to ptr to hash
**			bucket where we will insert the master.
**			Must enter with hash mutex locked.
**			(Will drop the mutex.)
**
** Outputs:
**	objid		If E_DB_INFO is returned, the qso_handle points to
**			the object that was created while we were off
**			reclaiming memory
**	master		This will contain the master object that will
**			own any QP's created with the objid object id.
**			The master will be locked.
**	err_code	If qso_mkindex() returns E_DB_ERROR then
**			err_code will hold an error code for explaination.
**			If qso_mkindex() returns E_DB_OK then err_code will
**			remain unchanged.
**
**	Returns:
**	    E_DB_OK, E_DB_INFO, E_DB_ERROR/FATAL
**
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	    Adds the object to the object list for one of the hash buckets, so
**	    all others will now see it.
**
** History:
**	30-nov-1992 (rog)
**          Initial creation.
**	09-jul-1993 (rog)
**          Initialize semaphore by calling CSi_semaphore() instead of just
**	    zeroing out bytes.  Also, name the semaphore.
**	15-oct-1993 (rog)
**          Initialize qsmo_alias to NULL in case this is a master object with
**	    no aliases.
**	21-Oct-2003 (jenjo02)
**	    qso_find() may find index but no object attached to it yet;
**	    that counts as "already exists".
**	22-Feb-2005 (schka24)
**	    Don't fill in object ID here, caller may drop this master if
**	    clrmem needed.  Let caller do it.  Invent INFO return so caller
**	    can handle situation where the object appeared while we were
**	    reclaiming.

** Description:
**      This routine will return TRUE if a QSF object exists with the supplied
**      name and type (these are supplied in a QSO_OBID structure), and FALSE
**	if not.  If an object is found, the handle portion of the supplied
**	object id will be filled in.
**
**	If the object is not found, the caller can request that we
**	return the hash bucket pointer where the object ID hashes to,
**	along with holding the hash mutex.  This should be done if the
**	caller will create a new object if not found.  Callers that
**	are just searching should pass NULL for the hash_p argument.
**
** Inputs:
**      qso_obid                        Object id.
**		.qso_lname		Length in bytes of the object name
**					given in .qso_name.  If zero, this
**					is an un-named object, and thus will
**					not be found.
**		.qso_name		Name of object.
**		.qso_type		Type of object.
**					If the type is QSO_ALIAS_OBJ, we are
**					to match against the master alias ID.
**					For any other type, we match against
**					the master regular ID (qsmo_obid).
**	master_p			An output
**	hash_p				If NULL, tells qso_find to not try
**					to return any hash info (lookup
**					only, not going to create later).
**
** Outputs:
**      qso_obid                        Object id.
**		.qso_handle		Handle for the object, if an object
**					is found.
**	master_p			Master object for the QP, if one is
**					found.
**	hash_p				Where to put hash bucket pointer, if
**					no object is found;  hash mutex
**					will be held (if hash_p != NULL).
**					If object IS found, *hash_p is set
**					to NULL.

**	Returns:
**	    object address if found
**	    NULL if not found
**

**
** History:
**	29-apr-86 (thurston)
**          Initial creation
**	21-aug-87 (thurston)
**	    Speeded up the search by looking at first 8 bytes of name as two
**	    i4's.  This will avoid excessive calls to MEcmp().  
**	29-jan-88 (thurston)
**	    Modified to use the qso_hash() routine and the hash buckets, which
**	    have replaced the single object queue in QSF.
**	30-nov-1992 (rog)
**	    Reworked function to find master objects in the hash table and to
**	    find the object based on those master objects.
**	15-oct-1993 (rog)
**	    We should not find objects marked for deferred destruction.
**	21-Oct-2003 (jenjo02)
**	    Watch for masters in the process of being constructed which
**	    as yet have no objects to avoid SEGV.
**	29-Jan-2004 (jenjo02)
**	    Plug race conditions in which a Master was in the
**	    process of being deleted from the hash list while
**	    we are looking at it.
**	31-Mar-2004 (jenjo02)
**	    Skip master's which have no qsmo_obj_1st.
**	22-Feb-2005 (schka24)
**	    Alias is no longer a separate object, find alias in the
**	    master index header.  Be slightly pickier with hash mutexing.

/**
** Name: qso_lkset - Lock an object.
**
** Description:
**      This routine is the low level object locker.  If it's a
**	named object, the object's master's mutex should be held
**	by the caller to prevent conflicts.
**
** Inputs:
**      obj				Ptr to object header.
**	lock_req			Requested lock state.
**
** Outputs:
**      lock_id				Lock ID.
**      root				Root address of locked object.
**	err_code			The QSF error that occurred.  One of:
**				E_QS0000_OK
**				    Operation succeeded.
**                              E_QS000D_CORRUPT
**				    QSF's object store has been corrupted.
**                              E_QS000F_BAD_HANDLE
**				    Supplied handle does not refer to an object.
**                              E_QS0014_EXLOCK
**                                  Object is already locked exclusively.
**                              E_QS0015_SHLOCK
**                                  Object is already locked shared.
**                              E_QS0016_BAD_LOCKSTATE
**                                  Illegal lock state; must be QSO_EXLOCK or
**                                  QSO_SHLOCK.
**
**	Returns:
**	    E_DB_OK
**	    E_DB_WARN
**	    E_DB_ERROR
**	    E_DB_FATAL
**	    
**
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**          If locking an exclusively locked object, the object will be
**          taken out of the QSO_FREE state and placed in the QSO_EXLOCK state
**          so that no other clients will be able to get either shared or
**          exclusive locks on the object.  If locking an object for shared
**          access, the number of share locks on that object will be
**          incremented.  If this number had been zero, the object will be taken
**          out of the QSO_FREE state and placed in the QSO_SHLOCK state,
**          meaning that other clients can get share locks on the object, but
**          cannot get an exclusive lock. 
**
** History:
**	05-aug-87 (thurston)
**          Initial creation
**	28-aug-1992 (rog)
**	    Change for(;;) to do/while(0) to silence compiler warning.
**	30-oct-1992 (rog)
**	    No need to set the LRU bit anymore.

/**
** Name: qso_hash() - Returns ptr to appropriate hash bucket for an obj ID.
**
** Description:
**      This is the hashing function for QSF's hash table of objects.  It hashes
**	an object ID into one of the available QSF hash buckets.
**
**	Only named, master objects get entered into the hash table, so
**	qso_hash() should never be called with an lname == 0.
**	
**	It is essential that object ID's and object alias ID's hash to
**	the same hash bucket.  In order for this to work, we can only
**	hash a limited subset of the object name;  specifically, the
**	text part of the DB_CURSOR_ID part of the name.  That's the
**	only part of an object ID that is guaranteed to match its alias.
**
** Inputs:
**      objid				Object ID to be hashed.
**	    .qso_lname
**	    .qso_name
**
** Outputs:
**      none
**
**	Returns:
**	    Ptr to appropriate hash bucket.
**	    If an error is detected, it will return NULL.
**	    
**
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	    Initializes qsb_sem on first hash to bucket.
**
** History:
**	29-jan-88 (thurston)
**          Initial creation
**	30-nov-1992 (rog)
**          Allowed function to hash into bucket 0.
**	03-aug-1993 (rog)
**	    Replace the hash function with one that spreads things out more
**	    evenly.  (This new function is based on a function from the section
**	    on hashing in the red dragon compiler book.)
**	21-sep-1993 (rog)
**	    Add definitions for variables used inside some xDEBUG code.
**	13-may-1994 (rog)
**	    Speed up the hashing function by only hashing on the name.
**	09-may-1996 (kch)
**	    We now check for DB_MAXNAME (32) characters in the object name
**	    as well as the first blank, by incrementing the counter n each
**	    time name is incremented, and then checking that n is less
**	    than DB_MAXNAME. This change fixes bug 75638.
**	26-Sep-2003 (jenjo02)
**	    Hash using HSH_char(), the Ingres standard.
**	    On first use of hash bucket, init its semaphore.
