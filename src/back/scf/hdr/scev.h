/**
** Name: scev.h	- Event Handling Subsystem Internal Structures
**
** Naming Note:
** 	Note that the data structures in this file are prefixed with EV for
**	historical reasons (originally this was to be the EV module of the CL).
**	These data structures are now manipulated in sceshare.c.
**
** Description:
**      This file contains the internal structures used by the event subsystem
**	for managing active server events and server event notifications. The
**	structures described in this file are contained in shared memory for
**	use in notifying all servers on this installation of relevant events.
**
**	Vax note: Events raised on one node are transmitted to other nodes in 
**	the cluster through the CSP which cooperates in implementing cluster-
**	wide event notification.
**
** Change Note:
**	Because the data structures described in this file are all allocated
**	out of a single shared segment (shared by multiple servers) make sure
**	to synchronize modifications of the shared segment (ie, any change in
**	size or use of the structures). To avoid incompatible uses of the same
**	segment in a user installation make sure to increase evs_version - this
**	is checked at connect-time.  For developers, who do not want to create
**	a separate installation just to test modifications (and want to allow
**	other test servers to work) you can modify EV_SEGNAME (and bump the
**	suffix).
**
** Structure Description:
**	The basic structures used in the event subsystem are described below.
**	It is important to understand that all the data structures are
**	allocated out of raw memory in the shared event segment and thus
**	are pointed at by offsets (from the root) rather than pointers. 
**	Because of this, when increasing sizes confirm that all sizes are
**	aligned.  To dump the data structures in this file use:
**		SET TRACE POINT SC922		(call sce_edump)
**	Note that it is WRONG to ever store addresses in a shared memory
**	segment, as the addresses may actually be mapped out to individual
**	processes.
**
**	There are two main data structures described here.  The event
**	hash list (for servers registered for a particular event), and server
**	instance hash lists (for servers connected to EV, together with their
**	current event instances):
**
**	* A list of all events that have at least one server registered.
**	  An event may be registered by 1 or more servers.  The events
**	  are anchored to an event hash structure (EV_HASH).
**
**	EV_HASH[bkt]------->EV_REVENT---->EV_REVENT----->
**			        |	      |
**			        V	      V
**			    EV_RSERVER	  EV_RSERVER
**			        |
**			        V
**			    EV_RSERVER
**
**	* A list of currently connected servers (they are not necessarily
**	  registered for any events).  Each server has a list of outstanding
**	  event instances awaiting reception by its event thread.  These are
**	  anchored to a server hash structure (EV_SVRHASH).
**
**	EV_SVRHASH[bkt]---->EV_SVRENTRY--->EV_SVRENTRY---->
**				 |	        |
**				 V		V
**			    EV_INSTANCE	       NULL (no instances)
**			         |
**				 V
**			    EV_INSTANCE
**
**	* A server that is registered for all events (such as the CSP on a 
**	  VAXcluster) is never really physically registered for any events
**	  (through EV_HASH), but is attached to the list of all-event-servers.
**	  Its instance lists follow normal processing.
**
** Locking/Semaphores:
**	Note that all hash chains on both data structures are protected by
**	semaphores.  To protect against semaphore deadlocks, resources must
**	always be claimed in the order EV_HASH followed by EV_SVRHASH.  If
**	a semaphore is currently claimed on EV_SVRHASH, a semaphore may not
**	be claimed on EV_HASH.  The free space/global semaphore may be claimed
**	at any time but no additional semaphores may be acquired while this
**	semaphore is held.  Sempahore hierarchy:
**
**		  Event Hash	   Server Hash	     Global
**		ev_ehsemaphore -> ev_shsemaphore -> evs_gsemaphore
**
**	The all-event-registered server semaphore (evs_asemaphore) behaves
**	like the event registration semaphore (ev_ehsemaphore):
**
**		All/Event Reg	   Server Hash	     Global
**		ev_asemaphore  -> ev_shsemaphore -> evs_gsemaphore
**
**	Because the locks are shared among multiple processes take care NOT
**	to issue I/O calls while holding these locks.  Unlike single
**	process semaphores, multi-process semaphores causes "waiters" to
**	spin while waiting for the semaphore.  For example, error messages
**	should NOT be issued while holding the locks.  Trace messages, however,
**	are OK as their purpose it to debug.

** Description:
**	The events for which there are current server registrations are

**	determined when the event subsystem is initialized.  The entries are
**	variable length (DBMS alerts are actually fixed, but this allows
**	for variable length events) and are identified by their offset from
**	the beginning of the event space.  Each entry in a bucket (2 events
**	that hash to the same bucket) is singly linked to its successor.
**
**	The hash chain also contains a semaphore for manipulating the contents
**	of the chain.  The semaphore must be set whenever searching or
**	modifying anything on the chain.
