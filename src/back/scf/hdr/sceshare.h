/**
** Name: sceshare.h - Event Handling Subsystem Interface Structures
**
** Description:
**      This file contains the structures used to communicate with the event
**	handling subsystem. The following structures are defined:
**
** Defines:
**	SCEV_EVENT		- Structure describing a server event.
**	SCEV_DCL_MACRO 		- Macro to declare a varying length event.
**	SCEV_CONTEXT		- Event subsystem context block.
**
** History:
**      12-aug-89 (paul)
**	    First written to support Alerters
**	14-feb-90 (neil)
**	    Modified interfaces and completed base functionality.
**	10-jan-91 (neil)
**	    Increased default number of instances.
**	25-jan-91 (neil)
**	    1. Pass global server memory [de]allocator semaphore to context CB
**	       to serialize all calls to MEget_pages (et al).
**	    2. Added define of a trace line for sceadmin to track.
**	30-May-95 (jenjo02)
**	    Added function prototypes for sce_mlock, sce_munlock to
**	    consolidate CSp|v_semaphore macros and function calls.
**  19-Sep-97 (merja01)
**      Increased the size of the SCEV_BLOCK_MAX.  Due to the 
**      datatype size differences for 64 bit, local storage was getting
**      overlayed in sce_raise when running with multiple DBMS servers.
**
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**      01-apr-2010 (stial01)
**          Changes for Long IDs
**      14-May-2010 (stial01)
**          Increase SCEV_BLOCK_MAX for Long IDs

** Name: SCEV_EVENT - For communicating with the cross-server event subsystem.
**
** Description:
**	The server event subsystem distributes event notifications to servers
**	registered with it.  Event descriptions are communicated through this
**	data structure. The structure is used by servers to:
**	
**	1. Register a server to be notified when the event occurs.
**	2. Deregister a server event notification.
**	3. Signal the occurrence of an event to other servers.
**	4. Receive a signaled event.
**
**	Note that servers use the event subsystem in much the same way that
**	user sessions may use the server alert hash lists.
**
**	An event is defined by an event name.  An event may also have an
**	optional event data block associated with it.  Note that the ev_ldata
**	is zero for a register event call and can be non-zero, indicating an
**	event data block, for signal and receive calls.  If ev_ldata is zero,
**	there is no data block associated with the event.
**
**	The event subsystem is assumed to be used only by privileged servers
**	within the installation.  The use of this subsystem by any other
**	"processes" will result in security problems since the subsystem
**	does not enforce privileges on server events.  Applications will
**	the alerters mechanism implemented by the DBMS (on top of the event
**	subsystem) to communicate application event occurence.  Note that a
**	'server' requires extra privileges in order to use the event subsystem.
**	This should preclude non-privileged user applications from gaining
**	access to the subsystem.
**
** Event Names:
** 	Event names are variable length strings (not NULL terminated).  The
**	ev_lname field, defining the length of the event name, counts all
**	characters.  Event names must be unique.  The contents of event name is
** 	not interpreted by the EV subsystem and are only compared for byte
**	equality with other event names.  Typically, the event name consists of
**	the database name, event name and event owner (DB_ALERT_NAME).  This
**	combination uniquely identifies an alert in the DBMS.

**	    Modified interfaces and completed base functionality.

**          add ev_flags and EV_NOORIG value for indicating that an event
**          originating with a server should not be sent by the event
**          subsystem to that server

** Name: SCEV_CONTEXT	- Context structure for all access to EV.
**
** Description:
**	This control structure is used for all requests into EV.  This
**	structure includes system configuration values (used by EV).  The
**	context (once established by EV) may not be modified by the callers.
**
**	The caller will set the external context fields, such as the
**	caller id (process id), error and trace routines.
**
**	The configuration values will be used initialize EV (when the
**	first server establishes a connection - sce_einitialize).  EV 
**	contains "registrations" (requests from servers to be notified when
**	a particular event occurs) and "instances" (signaled events queued
**	waiting to be received by each server).  The caller configuration
** 	information establishes the number of registrations and instances the
** 	event subsystem can handle.  Registrations and instances are
**	maintained in hash structures.  Fields evc_rbuckets and evc_ibuckets
**	define the number of buckets in each structure.  The optimal values
**	for these parameters are enough buckets to provide separate buckets
**	for the expected number of concurrently outstanding registrations and
**	instances.  Fields evc_maxre and evc_maxei are the maximum number
**	of registrations and instances allowed in the server event subsystem.
**	The configuration values are left in the context for internal use.
