** Name: SCD_CRB - Connection Request Block
**
** Description:
**      This structure is used to request the creation and connection
**      to a session within the Ingres DBMS.  It contains information
**      supplied by the client program which describes the method used
**      to connect to the server, the database to which the user wishes
**      to be attached, the query language to be used (QUEL or SQL0),
**      datatype information (such as date/money format, decimal separator
**      character ($ 3.00 vs. $DM 3,00, etc.), and any other session specific
**      information which happens to be created.
**
**      This structure will have to be very closely tied with the IN and CS
**      portions of the CL.  Perhaps even in them...film at 11 (1986).
**
** History:
**     19-Jun-1986 (fred)
**          Created.
