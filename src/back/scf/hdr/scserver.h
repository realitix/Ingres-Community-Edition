** Name: SCSERVER.H - Overall internal server definitions
**
** Description:
**      This file contains the definitions for types and constants
**      which are used throughout SCF on a server level.  That is,
**      these items control the overall execution of the system,
**      but are visible at all levels.
**
** History: $Log-for RCS$
**      25-Jun-1986 (fred)
**          Created on Jupiter
**      10-dec-1986 (fred)
**          Added dbdb stuff
**      12-Apr-2004 (stial01)
**          Define db_length as SIZE_TYPE.
**	17-Nov-2010 (jonj) SIR 124738
**	    Add SCV_NODBMO_MASK to prevent making MO objects for
**	    database, typically when fetching iidbdb information.

** Name: SCV_LOC - DMF locations for a database
**
** Description:
**      This structure holds an array of DMC_LOC_ENTRIES for use by
**      SCF in adding and opening databases.  These entries are filled
**      in by the dbdb session on the first attempt to open (and therefore
**      add) the database.

** History:
**     2-Jul-1986 (fred)
**          Created on Jupiter.
**	30-jan-1992 (bonobo)
**	    Removed the redundant typedefs to quiesce the ANSI C 
**	    compiler warnings.

** Name: SCV_DBCB - Database control block
**
** Description:
**      This structure contains information about databases which
**      are "known" to SCF.  A known database is one which has been added
**      to DMF.  This structure is used to keep track of resource utilization
**      within the server.
**
**      A known database CB contains the database name, the locations at which
**      the database resides, the mode with which the database was opened,
**      and the count of the number of users accessing the database.
**
** History:
**     25-Jun-1986 (fred)
**          Created on Jupiter.
**     05-nov-1993 (smc)
**          Bug #58635
**          Made l_reserved & owner elements PTR for consistency with DM_SVCB.
