** Name: SCE_RSESSION - Description of session registered for an alert
**
** Description:
**      Each session registered for a specific alert has one of these
**	entries linked to the SCE_ALERT structure describing the alert.
**	For a particular alert there may be a number of sessions registered
**	(requiring a list of SCE_RSESSION nodes).
**
**	This node is attached to the alert structure when a REGISTER EVENT
**	is issued (sce_register) and removed on REMOVE EVENT (sce_remove)
**	or the end of a session.
**
** History:
**	08-sep-89 (paul)
**	    First written for Alerters.
**	14-feb-90 (neil)
**	    Modified for new interfaces and cleanup.
**	30-jan-1992 (bonobo)
**	    Removed the redundant typedefs to quiesce the ANSI C 
**	    compiler warnings.
**     05-nov-1993 (smc)
**          Bug #58635
**          Made l_reserved & owner elements PTR for consistency with DM_SVCB.

** Description:

**	session.  It contains the alert name and the user data associated with
**	the alert (time the alert occurred, user specified text, etc.)

**	event is received from the event subsystem.  It is removed from

** Name: SCE_HASH - Control structure for hash array of alert registrations
**
** Description:
**      This structure contain the root of the hash array. The actual size
**	of this structure is dependent on the number of hash buckets
**	requested at server initialization.
**
**	This structure also contains free lists for currently unused
**	alert entries, registration entries, and instance entries. This allows
**	us to allocate them as needed but not free them unless we are
**	collecting too many free entries (more than the default number
**	of buckets).  This is done to avoid memory fragmentation for the
**	relatively small nodes on alert lists.
**
**	The "context" of the multi-server event subsystem is also pointed at
**	by this structure so that each server (with the correct locks)
**	can access the shared event subsystem.
