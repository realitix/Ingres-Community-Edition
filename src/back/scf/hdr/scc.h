** History:

**          Created.
**	30-jan-1992 (bonobo)
**	    Removed the redundant typedef to quiesce the ANSI C 
**	    compiler warnings.
**      29-Apr-1992 (fred)
**	    Added support for large datatypes.  W/in this file, this is the
**	    addition of the SCG_INCOMPLETE_MASK bit for the SCC_GCMSG field,
**	    which indicates by its presence that the message is incomplete,
**	    and that, therefore, the end of data indicator in GCF should not be
**	    turned on.
**     05-nov-1993 (smc)
**          Bug #58635
**          Made l_reserved & owner elements PTR for consistency with DM_SVCB.
**       1-Feb-2011 (hanal04) Bug 124876
**          Add comment that qeucopy.c relies on scg_next being the first
**          element in this structure.
**	29-Mar-2011 (kschendel) b125204
**	    Add copy sequence, shrink mtype and mask so that structure doesn't
**	    balloon up with alignment padding.  Drop above comment, no longer
**	    applicable.

** Name: SCC_GCEV_MSG - Dummy event message (for allocation sizes)

** Description:
**	This structure is only defined to allocate a single GCA_EVENT message
**	which is variable length.  Because of the varying length fields the
**	structure includes the GCA_EV_DATA structure plus place holders for
**	the run-time determined values.  This is only allocated once in scdmain
**	so some extra space does not really impact anything, plus the
**	pre-allocation reduces CPU overhead.
**
**	It is important to put this in a structure so that when it is "picked"
**	out of a larger allocation (scdmain) it does not throw the alignment
**	off.

**      21-mar-90 (neil)
