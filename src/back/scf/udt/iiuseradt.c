/*{
** Name: IIudadt_register	- Default datatype registration function
**
** Description:
**      As mentioned above, this routine does absolutely nothing.  It simply
**	returns.  This is the default activity for a system in which there are
**	no user defined datatypes.  Note that on systems for which user defined
**	datatype support has not been purchased, this routine will not be called. 
**
** Inputs:
**      add_block                       Pointer to pointer to block to filled in
**					with the datatypes being defined.
**
** Outputs:
**      *add_block                      Were this function doing something, the
**					add block pointer would be filled with a
**					pointer to the datatypes to be defined.
**					However, since the intent of this
**					routine is to define NO datatypes, this
**					value is untouched -- that is, it
**					remains at zero.
**
**	Returns:
**	    0 -- indicating success.
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	    none
**
** History:
**      4-may-1989 (fred)
**          Created.
**	2-Jul-1993 (daveb)
**	    prototyped, added header inclusions for right types.
