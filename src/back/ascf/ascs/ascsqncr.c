/*
**  FLOW SUMMARY
**  ------------
**
**  When thinking of a client front-end and Frontier server, the following
**  scheme can help:
**
**      Client				    Server
**      ------				    ------
**
**      Work				    Nothing
**      				    Wait on Read (suspend thru CS)
**      Send Query to DBMS -------------->  Read  completes
**      				    +- Enter Sequencer -----+
**      				    |  Process	            | (loop)
**      				    |  Write to Client      |
**      Read Results       <--------------  +- CS suspend on Write -+
**
**
**  Within the server itself it is useful to understand the interface
**  between CS (the dispatcher), ASCS (the sequencer) and SCC (sequencer
**  communication support routines).  Typically, the session suspends
**  reading (after scc_recv), gets input and enters the sequencer, after
**  which it usually then writes everything it has to the user (and
**  suspends after each scc_send).  I say "usually" as the sequencer may
**  notice that it only read one small part of a large query and needs to
**  read more.  The following is a conceptual outline of the CS loop that
**  controls this flow (this is part of CS_setup elaborated for the
**  sequencer):
**
**      mode = CS_INPUT;
**      while (true) 				-- loop until termination
**      {
**          if (mode = CS_INPUT)
**          {
**      	status = scc_recv();		-- post read
**      	if (status == OK)
**      	    status = CSsuspend();
**      	check for termination;
**          }
**          ascs_sequencer(mode, &next_mode);
**          check for termination;
**          if (next_mode == CS_OUTPUT || CS_EXCHANGE)
**          {
**      	do
**      	{
**      	    status = scc_send();	-- post write
**      	    if (status == OK)
**      		status = CSsuspend();
**      	} while (status != OK);
**      	check for termination;
**          }
**          if (next_mode = CS_EXCHANGE)	-- just a short cut
**      	mode = CS_INPUT;
**          else
**      	mode = next_mode;
**      }
**
**  The CS_EXCHANGE mode is the "typical" mode that is returned when all
**  the user results have been queued for the session and we want CS to
**  cause all of them to be returned to the user.  The CS_OUTPUT mode
**  is used when, in order to complete the actual request, we must return
**  to the sequencer to continue processing (i.e. middle of a SELECT loop
**  or COPY statement).
**
**  With the above loop (and short explanation) in mind a lot of processing
**  can be understood.  In particular processing that involves multiple
**  messages and possible return to the sequencer (such as SELECT loops,
**  COPY processing, etc.) Alerts follow the above model but modify some of
**  the internal workings of various SCC routines (scc_send, in particular)
**  to allow clients to read data without having to issue a query (a key
**  requirement of this feature).
**
**  HIGH LEVEL FACT SUMMARY:
**  -----------------------
**
**  Given the description above the following is a summary of various
**  "facts" that must always be taken into account when thinking about the
**  "sending-of-alert-messages-to-user" problem.  None of these "facts"
**  assume a particular solution:
**
**  [F1] A session must be made interruptable (for alerts) so that it may
**       be woken up to process events.  This would occur when it is
**  sitting waiting for a query.  This is to allow alerts to be sent to a
**  program as soon as possible, in particular for programs that are just
**  reading alerts (GET EVENT), such as event monitors.
**
**  [F2] The session can be in a pending-read state (for a query) when it
**       is made runnable to process and "send" alerts.  It is exactly
**  during this time that various problems arise, described later.  And,
**  it is during this time when it is most common for alerts to be sent.
**
**  [F3] Alerts that the event thread attaches while the target thread is
**       processing a query are no problem.  These alerts are eventually
**  added as GCA messages that are sent to the client with the rest of the
**  query results, like trace messages but in front of query results (just
**  for faster availability).  Since these are no problem they are not
**  really discussed here.  In fact, if query results were the only time
**  we sent already queued alerts to the client this design note would not
**  be necessary.
**
**  [F4] GCA Alert messages, because of their size and nature, may not be sent
**       on the GCA expedited channel.  This was agreed upon during a
**  design review for "GCA alert message sending".
**
**  [F5] When the session is sending a GCA alert message to the client that
**       is not in the context of query (see [F3] above for *in* query
**  context), the session MUST NOT suspend after the send operation.  Why?
**  If we suspend waiting for the client to read the just-sent alert message,
**  we may cause a write/write deadlock with the client who is really trying
**  to send the DBMS a query to process.  Even though the client may intend to
**  turn around and read the alert message, we have to be able to read the
**  query first to allow them to read the alert (if the client is synchronous
**  this is even more critical).  The CS "write" routine (scc_send) return
**  status, E_CS001D_NO_MORE_WRITES, comes in handy for this "no-suspend" case.
**  This is all described later.  As mentioned above [F3] when alert messages
**  are sent in the context of query results we want to treat them like normal
**  data and they follow the regular query result processing.
**
**  [F6] When the sending of a GCA alert message (that is not in the
**       context of query results) completes, we always want to return to
**  the sequencer to send more (if there are any more alerts) and to clean
**  up (if there are no more alerts).  This return to the sequencer also
**  plays an important role in the modification of newly introduced session
**  alert state that each session has associated with alerts.  (This fact
**  is somewhat dependent on the solution below).
**
**  [F7] If an earlier sending of a GCA alert message completes while we
**       we are processing a query we must inhibit the GCA completion
**  routine for that alert (so as not to conflict with later CSsuspend
**  calls for other resources).  Why?  CSresume calls are sort of "queued"
**  and saved for a particlar thread - a subsequent CSsuspend to an orphan
**  CSresume notification will immediately resume.  Note that completion
**  routines associated with single GCA calls, and GCA_NO_ASYNC_EXIT flags
**  do not modify the solution.
**
**  [F8] When a session is invoked to process a query, an alert may already
**       be sent to the client (though may not necessarily have been read).
**  We make no attempt to flush all queued alerts to the client, as they
**  may not yet be ready to read them.  Any already queued alerts (and those
**  that are raised during this session's query processing) will eventually
**  be transmitted to the client with the GCA query results.  This was done
**  so as not to complicate the problem we already have.  Eventually this
**  may be modified as a performance enhancement.
**
**  [F9] Whenever possible we should try to get the alert to the client
**       without it being purged by GCA.  Consequently, between the time
**  that a user interrupt arrives and the time that the GCA_IACK message
**  is sent to the client, no queued alerts should be transformed into
**  GCA alert messages (they will be purged by SCC).  This is just a
**  performance enhancement, and references to GCA_IACK can be ignored
**  when trying to understand the total solution.
**
**  PROBLEMS TO DEAL WITH:
**  ---------------------
**
**  This section attempts to summarize the key problems that I am trying to
**  solve.  All of the problems arise from the requirement that we must
**  send the alert to the client outside of a query-result context.
**  Later in this note is an "alert state" description.  This state solves
**  these problems and more:
**
**  [P1] Concurrent sending of an alert message and the reading of a query
**       is a complex problem.  This is the key situation that we are trying
**  to resolve in this design note.  Typically, a client alert monitor will
**  be reading alerts and for each event will be issuing some kind of query.
**  While this query is running another alert may arrive.  The arrival of
**  the alert may be just before, during or after the processing of the
**  query in the sequencer.  Note that alerts that arrive during query
**  processing are no problem - they are sent off with the query results.
**
**  [P2] Concurrent writes by the DBMS must be avoided.  We have to make
**       sure not to send more than one message to the client.  This problem
**  must be avoided for multiple alerts (i.e. we must serialize sending each
**  individual alert to the client) and for alerts followed by query results
**  (an alert that is pending must make sure to complete before we can send
**  any query results).
**
**  [P3] Sending alerts to the client uses GCA (and its completion exit
**       scc_gcomplete).  Typically this completion routine resumes the
**  thread that was issuing the operation.  As mentioned above, we do not
**  suspend the thread on the send of the alert message when it is outside
**  of query result context.  Consequently, the CSresume normally driven by
**  the GCA completion exit (scc_gcomplete) may "land" us in unexpected
**  contexts if allowed to execute while we are inside the sequencer.  For
**  example, we may already have advanced into query processing when the
**  previous sending of the alert message completes.  We need to inhibit
**  the CSresume call to avoid leaving the CS "event done" flag set
**  (CS_EDONE_MASK) - this would cause the next CSsuspend to immediately
**  complete, probably without the necessary resource (i.e. a requested lock).
**  On the other hand, if no query is happening and the client does read
**  the alert, we would like to wake up the session so that it can continue
**  with the next alert (if there are any).
**
**  [P4] Most of the solution is based on a new session alert state field
**       (sscb_astate).  The modification of this field must be done under
**  strict control, and its various settings will guarantee that the session
**  is processing alerts as expected.  This state is synchronized with
**  the SCS query processing state, the GCA send & receive message buffer
**  states, and with the current queue of session-owned alerts.
