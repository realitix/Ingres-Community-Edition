** Name: ULHCTRL.H - Control Blocks and Def's used internally by ULH.
**
** Description:
**      This header file contains definitions of all data structures and
**	constants used internally by ULH.
**
** History:
**      08-jan-87 (puree)
**          initial version.
**	18-sep-87 (puree)
**	    Add user semaphores to hash objects.  Remove all other semaphores
**	    but the table semaphore to avoid unneccesary semaphore overhead.
**	02-nov-87 (puree)
**	    Added alias support.
**	04-apr-90 (andre)
**	    Defined a new structure, ULH_HALIAS, to represent an alias and moved
**	    several fields from ULH_HOBJ into it.  This was required to support
**	    multiple aliases.
**      14-aug-91 (jrb)
**          Changed ulh_usem to be a CS_SEMAPHORE instead of SCF_SEMAPHORE in
**          ULH_HOBJ.
**      07-apr-93 (smc)
**          Commented out text after ifdef.
**	03-jun-1996 (canor01)
**	    Change two char members of ULH_HOBJ to nats.  This structure in
**	    part overlaps with a ULH_OBJECT structure.  With the Solaris 4.0
**	    C compiler, the structures don't align with one another.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**      12-Apr-2004 (stial01)
**          Define tcb_length as SIZE_TYPE.

** Name: ULH_LINK - Queue Linker Strucutre
**
** Description:
**      In order to share common queue manipulation routines among various
**      ULH queues, a standard pointer structure, ULH_LINK, is implemented.
**      This structure is embedded in the data structure of each member of
**      a queue (or a list).  Members of a queue are linked together using
**      the ULH_LINK's.. Multiple ULH_LINK's are needed for a structure
**      that may become a member to multiple lists as the same time.
**
** History:
**      08-jan-87 (puree)
**          initial version.

** Name: ULH_UNIT - A Unit of A Queue/List Member
**
** Description:
**      This structure is embedded in every object or class header
**      block.  Its main purpose is to ensure the relative location
**	of object/class name string and the ULH_LINK within each 
**	object/class header.  This allows the use of a single search
**	routine for both the object and the class buckets.
**
**      Caution:
**	This structure overlays a portion of  the ULH_OBJECT structure 
**	in ULH.H.  Any 	changes in this structure must be manually copied 
**	to ULH_OBJECT.

**      to the object bucket array is kept in ULH_TCB.ulh_otab and the
**      pointer to the class bucket array is kept in ULH_TCB.ulh_ctab.

** Name: ULH_CHDR - A Class Header
**
** Description:
**      A class is a linked list of objects that bear certain relationship
**      to each other.  The class header block, ULH_CHDR, is used to
**      represent a class.  It contains the name string of the class and
**      a queue header to which member objects are linked together.
**      Classes that yield the same hash key are linked together to the
**      same hash bucket in the class table.
**
**	All class header blocks are allocated at the same time, and
**	from the same memory stream, as the class table (the class
**	bucket array).  The empty class headers are linked together
**	in the LIFO queue, ULH_TCB.ulh_chq.

**      08-jan-87 (puree)

/*}
** Name: ULH_HOBJ - Internal ULH Object Header
**
** Description:
**      This structure is the object header used internally by ULH.  It
**      contains all information pertaining to an object.  The structure
**      is created and destroyed together with the object it represents.
**      The data space for the structure is allocated in its owns memory
**      stream from the table memory pool.  The user-visible portion of
**      of the object header begins at .ulh_unit.ulh_link.object and
**      extends to the end of the structure.  When a user is granted
**      access to an object, the pointer to this structure is returned
**      in ULH_RCB.ulh_object->ulh_id.  This pointer is required for all
**      subsequent accesses to the object.
**
** History:
**      08-jan-87 (puree)
**          initial version.
**	02-nov-87 (puree)
**	    added back ptr for alias bucket
**	4-apr-90 (andre)
**	    To facilitate implementation of synonyms, we wil  (finally) start
**	    supporting multiple aliases.  As a result, the following fields
**	    will be moved from ULH_HOBJ into ULH_HALIAS:
**		ulh_ap, ulh_alink, ulh_alias_len, ulh_halias
**	    We also need to add a  queue structure to be used when we need to
**	    access the list of synonyms associated with this object
**      14-aug-91 (jrb)
**          Changed ulh_usem to be a CS_SEMAPHORE instead of SCF_SEMAPHORE.
**	29-may-92 (teresa)
**	    Added ulh_uniq_id for class support.

** Name: ULH_HALIAS - Internal ULH Object Alias structure
**
** Description:
**      This structure represents an alias defined for some object.

**	with a specific hash backet and the other - with the object for which it
**	was defined.  Each alias will also contain a pointer to the object for
**	which it was defined to facilitate access to the object (and all info
**	contained therein) once an alias has been located.
**
**	NOTE: if some changes are made to this structure or any structures
**	      therein, ULH_H_ALIAS_SIZE in ulh.h must be changed to reflect the

** Name: ULH_TCB - Hash Table Control Block
**
** Description:
**      This data strucuture is the primary control block for a (logical)

**      the table.  The strucuture is created when the table is created
