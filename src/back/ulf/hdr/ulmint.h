/**
** Name: ULMINT.H - Internal typedefs and defines needed by ULM.
**
** Description:
**      This file contains definitions of all of the structures and
**      symbolic constants needed by the Utility Library Memory
**      Management Module (ULM).  This file depends on the following
**	files already being #included:
**		dbms.h
**		cs.h	(for the CS_SEMAPHORE in ULM_PHEAD)
**
**      This file defines the following typedefs:
**	    ULM_NODE - Allocation node
**	    ULM_HEAD - Head for allocated and free node chains
**	    ULM_STREAM - Memory stream
**	    ULM_CHUNK - Memory stream chunk (large, contiguous section
**			of a memory pool)
**	    ULM_BLOCK - Memory stream block
**	    ULM_PHEAD - Memory pool header
**	    ULM_I_SMARK - Stream mark; internal representation.
**
** History: $Log-for RCS$
**	08-apr-86 (thurston)
**          Initial creation.  Some typedefs taken from Jeff Lichtman's
**          ULM.C file.
**	01-aug-86 (thurston)
**	    In the ULM_PHEAD typedef, I changed the name of member
**	    .ulm_psize_512 to be .ulm_psize_pag, since we are now using
**	    the constant SCU_MPAGESIZE instead of 512.
**	17-jul-87 (thurston)
**	    Added ULM_I_SMARK.
**	29-oct-87 (thurston)
**	    Added ULM_CHUNK, and associated constants, and fields in the
**	    ULM_PHEAD structure.
**      02-nov-87 (thurston)
**	    Added the standard structure header to the ULM_CHUNK typedef.
**	04-nov-87 (thurston)
**	    Added the .ulm_pchsize_pag field to the ULM_PHEAD typedef.
**	28-nov-87 (thurston)
**	    Changed the SCF_SEMAPHORE to a CS_SEMAPHORE in ULM_PHEAD typedef,
**	    to enable easier usage of CS{p,v}_semaphore() routines instead of
**	    going through SCF.
**	12-jan-88 (thurston)
**	    Added the .ulm_nprev pointer to the ULM_NODE typedef.
**	17-may-1993 (rog)
**	    Increase the default chunk size to 32K.
**	07-Aug-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Added ulm_self to ULM_PHEAD and ULM_STREAM so ULM can sanity
**	    check these structures.
**	14-Aug-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Added ulm_sblspa to ULM_STREAM to track first block with space.
**	15-Aug-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Introduced the notion of private and shareable streams. Private streams
**	    are assumed to be thread-safe while shareable streams are not. It
**	    is the stream creator's responsibility to define this characteristic
**	    when the stream is created by ulm_openstream(). Unless defined explicitly
**	    as ULM_PRIVATE_STREAM, all streams will be assumed to be shareable
**	    and will be mutex protected; private streams do not incur the overhead
**	    of mutex protection.
**	    For this, added ulm_ssem, ulm_flags to ULM_STREAM.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**      12-Apr-2004 (stial01)
**          Define ulm_length as SIZE_TYPE.
**	9-feb-2007 (kibro01) b113972
**	    Add ulm_stream_marker to detect a twice-closed stream without
**	    crashing.
**	11-feb-2008 (smeke01) b113972
**	    Backed out above change.

**	01-aug-86 (thurston)
**	    Changed the name of member .ulm_psize_512 to be .ulm_psize_pag,
**	    since we are now using the constant SCU_MPAGESIZE instead of 512.
**	29-oct-87 (thurston)
**	    Added the fields needed to support memory pools that do not get
**	    fully allocated at startup time; those dealing with "chunks":
**				.ulm_pages_alloced
**				.ulm_pchunks
**				.ulm_pch1st

**	04-nov-87 (thurston)

**	    of CS{p,v}_semaphore() routines instead of going through SCF.
**	07-Aug-1997 (jenjo02)
