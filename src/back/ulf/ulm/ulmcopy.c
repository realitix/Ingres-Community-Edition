/*{
** Name: ulm_copy	- Copy large amounts of memory.
**
** Description:
**
**	This routine is obsolete and should not be used.
**
**	This function copies large amounts of data from one memory location
**	to another by repeatedly calling MEcopy().  MEcopy() used to
**	only copy 64k bytes at a time, hence the need for this function.
**	We no longer port to 80286's and no current memcpy has a 64K limit.
**
** Inputs:
**	source				PTR to the memory to copy
**	nbytes				The number of bytes to copy
**
** Outputs:
**	dest				PTR to the memory to be written
**
** Returns:
**	None
**
** Exceptions:
**	None
**
** History:
**      13-oct-1993 (rog)
**          Created from code written by anitap in opcadf.c.
