/*{
** Name: psq_recreate	- Identifies procedure QP in memory or recreates
**			  the procedure tree.
**
** Description:
**	This module verifies that a procedure is define in the system
**	catalogs and tries to identify Query Execution Plan for the procedure
**	in QSF memory. If the plan is not present parser is invoked to 
**	recreate the procedure tree. The query mode returned for these two
**	cases is different, because the sequencer needs to take different
**	course of action for each one of the cases.
**
** Inputs:
**	psq_cb		    - query control block.
**	sess_cb		    - session control block.
**
** Outputs:
**	psq_cb
**	    .psq_mode	    - query mode
**
**	Returns:
**	    E_DB_OK status if succeeded, error otherwise.
**	Exceptions:
**	    None.
**
** Side Effects:
**	    Allocates QSF memory for the procedure tree if the QP cannot
**	    be located.
**
** History:
**      24-may-88
**	    Created.

**	    Improve recovery of resources.
**	03-aug-88 (andre)
**	    Modified the procedure to assure that under all conditions
**	    QSF object is released before returning.  Also made a change to
**	    ensure that RDF object is released as soon as it is no longer
**	    needed.
**	03-aug-88 (andre)
**	    Declare rdf_cb to pass to psy_gproc and psy_dbpproc
**	04-aug-88 (andre)
**	    Added a check to see if the user has permission to execute
**	    this procedure.
**	23-aug-88 (stec)
**	    pss_ruser -> pss_rusr.
**	27-sep-88 (stec)
**	    Use DB proc owner name from rdf_cb.rdf_rb.rdr_owner.
**	29-nov-88 (stec)
**	    Change code related to translate_or_define to reflect
**	    changes in the definition of QSO_OBID.
**	16-mar-89(andre)
**	    Make sure that pss_user contains the real user name before the
**	    psq_recreate() returns.  The following changes were made:  interface
**	    to psy_gproc was changes so that psy_gproc no longer sets any flags
**	    or switches owner names, instead it may set a ptr to the alternate
**	    name to be used.  PSQ_RECREATE() would set the flag and switch the
**	    names immediately before calling psq_parseqry() and would undo these
**	    changes immediately afterwards.
**	29-mar-89 (andre)
**	    Make sure that we always UNFIX the RDF object and DESTROY the QSF
**	    object containing the query text before leaving psq_recreate().

**	    Don't use group/role id's when compiling database procedures.
**	1-jun-90 (andre)
**	    interface for psy_gproc() has changed somewhat.
**	13-sep-90 (teresa)
**	    some flags have become bitmasks: PSS_RUSET and PSQ_ALIAS_SET and
**	    PSS_RASET and PSS_RGSET
**	27-sep-90 (ralph)
**	    Call psy_dbpperm even if user own procedure, so that procedure
**	    execution can be audited in one centralized place (bug 21243).
**	    Move auditing to psy_dbpperm.
**	20-feb-91 (andre)
**	    As a part of fix for bug #32457, pss_raset, pss_raplid, pss_rgset,
**	    and pss_rgroup have been removed from PSS_SESBLK.
**	    Also, interface to psy_dbpperm() has changed.
**	20-sep-91 (andre)
**	    set psq_mode to PSQ_EXEDBP before calling psy_dbpperm()
**	30-sep-91 (andre)
**	    before calling psq_parseqry(), set sess_cb->pss_dependencies_stream
**	    to &sess_cb->pss_ostream.
**	12-feb-92 (andre)
**	    rather than passing a flag field to indicate whether the user
**	    posessed required privilege, we will pass an address of a map
**	    describing privilege - if upon return it is non-zero, user lacked
**	    required privilege
**	19-may-92 (andre)
**	    if recreating a dbproc owned by the current user which is not marked
**	    as at least ACTIVE, we will invoke psy_dbp_status() to check whether
**	    it is, in fact, dormant.
**
**	    we should not have pss_dependencies_stream point at pss_ostream
**	    since if we need to call psy_dbp_status(), pss_dependencies_stream
**	    will point at a stream with a handle which has been zeroed out -
**	    instead, in pslsgram.yi, we will open a new stream and have
**	    pss_dependencies_stream point at it; after calling psq_parseqry(),
**	    this function will be responsible for closing the stream pointed to
**	    by pss_dependencies_stream before returning.
**	27-jun-92 (andre)
**	    If recreating a dbproc owned by the current user and
**	    IIPROCEDURE.dbp_mask1 indicated that it is not active and that
**	    IIDBDEPENDS/IIPRIV do not contain the independent object/privilege
**	    list for the dbproc, but one was built in the course of reparsing
**	    the dbproc, enter the list into appropriate catalogs and modify
**	    IIPROCEDURE.dbp_mask1 to indicate that the list exists before
**	    calling psy_dbp_status() to verify that the dbproc is active
**	09-sep-92 (andre)
**	    psy_dbp_status() no longer accepts or returns an indicator of
**	    whether cache had to be flushed in psy_dbp_priv_check()
**	29-sep-92 (andre)
**	    renamed RDR_2DBP_STATUS to RDR2_DBP_STATUS
**	07-nov-92 (andre)
**	    we will no longer be creating private and public aliases for dbproc
**	    QPs because we claim that a permit on a dbproc will be allowed to
**	    remain in existsnce only if the dbproc is grantable; fot the same
**	    reason we'll stop setting PSS_1DBP_MUSTBE_GRANTABLE in pss_dbp_flags
**	12-apr-93 (tam)
**	    In support of owner.procedure, if PSQ_OWNER_SET is set by SCF, 
**	    use psq_als_owner for the owner field.  Note that psq_als_owner
**	    is already used for another purpose (to bypass permission check
**	    in an internal recreate situation).  But should be ok to reuse.
**	28-jul-93 (andre)
**	    sess_cb->pss_indep_objs.psq_grantee was left uninitialized when
**	    calling RDF to enter independent object/privilege list - very bad
**	10-aug-93 (andre)
**	    fixed causes of compiler warnings
**	27-aug-93 (andre)
**		(fix for bug 54348)
**	    if an error occurs AFTER we call psq_parseqry() to reparse dbproc 
**	    definition, call psq_destr_dbp_qep() to destroy QEP object created 
**	    in create_dbproc: production
**	01-sep-93 (jhahn)
**	    Added support for multiple query plans for set input procedures.
**	01-sep-93 (andre)
**	    if the dbproc was marked dormant and now it appears to be active,
**	    sess_cb->pss_dbp_ubt_id may contain id of a base table (other than 
**	    a core catalog) on which this dbproc depends (if no such table was 
**	    found, sess_cb->pss_dbp_ubt_id will contain (0,0)).
**	    if the independent object/privilege list for it is non-empty, we 
**	    copy sess_cb->pss_dbp_ubt_id into proctuple.db_dbp_ubt_id to ensure
**	    that it gets stored in IIPROCEDURE tuple
**	12-jan-94 (andre)
**	    (fix for bug 58048)
**	    Here's my explanations of what caused the server to hang:
**	      - several sessions attempted to execute a database procedure P 
**		which for some reason (e.g. a table used in it got dropped and 
**		recreated) got marked dormant, but did not have a QP id, so 
**		they send INVPROC with a bogus id which brought us into 
**		psq_recreate()
**	      - since the QP object was yet to be created QSOJUST_TRANS call 
**		from psq_recreate() failed to locate an existing QP plan which 
**		resulted in all sessions proceeding to reparse the dbproc - 
**		side effect of this was that they all got a S lock on the page 
**		where the IIPROCEDURE tuple describing P resides (because when 
**		recreating a dbproc we tell RDF to ensure that we see no 
**		stale entries)
**	      - eventually all sessions finished reparsing the dbproc and tried 
**		to QSO_TRANS_OR_DEFINE a new QP object - since the object did 
**		not exist yet, one of the sessions created the object (and got 
**		an exclusive lock on it) while the others were left waiting on 
**		the lock (all the while holding a shared lock on IIPROCEDURE 
**		page)
**	      - the session that acquired exclusive lock on the QP object built
**		a list of objects and privileges on which the dbproc depends 
**		and tried to enter it into IIPRIV + to update IIPROCEDURE to 
**		indicate that the list exists and that the dbproc is no longer 
**		dormant; unfortunately, this required that it acquire an 
**		exclusive lock on an IIPROCEDURE page where P's description 
**		resided, and that it could not do because other sessions were 
**		holding shared lock on it
**
**	    To fix this bug, we will ensure that no two sessions (in a given 
**	    server) go through the motions of reparsing and recreating any 
**	    given dbproc.  The first session to get into psq_recreate() will 
**	    perform all work required to recreate a dbproc (including reparsing
**	    it and building an independent object/privilege list, if necessary)
**	    and the subsequent sessions will wait until the plan has been built
**	    and will never even try to repqrse the dbproc because they will 
**	    find the QP while still in psq_recreate().  This will have a 
**	    positive effect of fixing this bug and will help us avoid having 
**	    several sessions perform redundant work in the bargain.
**
**	    In order to ensure that no two sessions in a server attempt to 
**	    recreate the same dbproc at the same time, we will 
**	    QSO_TRANS_OR_DEFINE a QP object BEFORE (this is important) looking 
**	    up a dbproc definition.  This will ensure that the first session 
**	    to get into psq_recreate() will be the only session (if any) to go 
**	    through the full process of reparsing a dbproc and rebuilding and 
**	    updating (if necessary) its independent object/privilege list and 
**	    status.  Things get somewhat more complicated by the fact that we 
**	    may be given only the dbproc name and not the name of the schema in
**	    which it resides (this will happen if an ESQL application invokes 
**	    a dbproc without specifying name of the schema in which it resides.)
**
**	    In order to ensure that no two sessions go through the motions of 
**	    reparsing a dbproc, we will TRANS_OR_DEFINE a QP object BEFORE
**	    looking up definition of a dbproc by the current user, and 
**	    if unsuccessful, repeat the same for DBA and $INGRES.  If an 
**	    application invokes DBA's (or $ingres') dbproc without using 
**	    schema.object construct and the QP does not exist (or is not known 
**	    to the application), this will result in a slight increase in the 
**	    cost of executing the dbproc (since we may end up creating and 
**	    destroying QSF objects for QPs that turned out to not exist), but 
**	    assuming that in most cases user will be executing his own dbproc, 
**	    this change will result in no additional expense.  Furthermore, 
**	    because we will prevent multiple sessions from unnecessarily 
**	    reparsing the same dbproc, this will actually result in a saving 
**	    of CPU resources because only one session will go through the 
**	    reparsing process
**	13-jan-94 (andre)
**	    since now we may ask psy_gproc() whether the current user owns a 
**	    dbproc by a given name, then the DBA, and then $ingres, we no 
**	    longer want it to produce an error message if it does not find a 
**	    dbproc owned by a specified user - instead it will be up to the 
**	    caller to decide to issue an error message and which error message 
**	    to issue
**	04-mar-93 (andre)
**	    The original fix for bug 58048 was not as successful as I had hoped.
**	    While it has made some matters better, it has not completely 
**	    eliminated the cause of undetectable deadlocks (one session could 
**	    still end up holding a lock on a QSF object and attempt to acquire 
**	    X lock on a catalog page while other session(s) would be waiting 
**	    for a lock on QSF object all the while holding an S lock on the 
**	    catalog page of interest to the first session.)  The earlier fix 
**	    handled the situation described in the comment from (12-jan-94), but
**	    it was helpless against the scenario executed by our fine ITB 
**	    benchmark:
**	      briefly, ITB creates the relevant tables in the setup part but 
**	      also drops and recreates them before spanning the individual 
**	      sessions in the driver section.  As a result, after the first 
**	      invocation of the driver the following sequence of events 
**	      results in a hung server:
**		- ITB master drops and recreates a table used in the dbproc
**		- all sessions come into psq_recreate(), execute TRANS_OR_DEFINE
**		  and find the existing QP (no one knows yet that it was 
**		  rendered obsolete by destruction and recreation of a table 
**		  used in the dbproc)
**		- all sessions look up definition of the dbproc to make sure 
**		  they can execute it, acquiring in the process an S lock on 
**		  IIPROCEDURE page describing the dbproc
**		- QEF tries to execute the QP and discovers that it has become 
**		  obsolete - all sessions find themselves again in 
**		  psq_recreate()
**		- the first session to do TRANS_OR_DEFINE ends up DEFINing while
**		  the remaining sessions will wait on the QSF object,
**		- the first session will proceed to parse the text of the dbproc
**		  and attempt to update IIPROCEDURE tuple to indicate that the 
**		  dbproc is no longer dormant - unfortunately, the sessions 
**		  waiting for the QSF object are holding an S lock on 
**		  IIPROCEDURE page preventing the first session from updating 
**		  it - the server hangs.
**
**	    If we could guarantee that all sessions are connected to the 
**	    same server (or if we had a mechanism to syncronize QSF caches
**	    across servers in a given installation), it would suffice to alter 
**	    code in QEU that marks a dbproc dormant to also destroy its QP;
**
**	    However, given that we canNOT guarantee that all sessions will be
**	    connected to the same server AND we do NOT have a mechanism to 
**	    syncronize QSF caches across servers in a given installation, we 
**	    must settle for turning an undetectable deadlock into a 
**	    detectable one.  This will be accomplished by invoking 
**	    JUST_TRANS to determine whether a QP exists before diving into 
**	    psq_parseqry() and, failing that, parsing a dbproc and attempting 
**	    to update IIPROCEDURE (and IIDBDEPENDS/IIPRIV) before invoking
**	    TRANS_OR_DEFINE.
**
**	    Then, the scenario described above will result in multiple sessions 
**	    holding S locks on IIPROCEDURE page trying to update that page 
**	    resulting in a detectable deadlock.  DMF will rollback all but one 
**	    session which will succeed in updating the IIPROCEDURE page and 
**	    DEFINing the QP object.  The sessions which were rolled back in 
**	    the process of resolving the deadlock will come back into 
**	    psq_recreate(), wait for the lucky session to commit a transaction,
**	    and then discover that a QP for the dbproc already exists.

/*{
** Name: psq_dbpreg   - Identifies registered db procedure in QSF, in
**			support of execution of a registered dbproc in star.
**
** Description:
**	This function locates a registered dbproc in QSF.
**	If the dbproc is not found in QSF, it will be retrieved from 
**	the system catalog (through RDF).  An QSF QTREE object, containing
**	the ldb description of the actual procedure, will then
**	be created for the dbproc.  Since star doesn't care about the
**	query plan for the dbproc itself, a registered dbproc is more
**	like a registered table and there is no real parsing involved.
**
**	In searching the RDF cache, the user name, the dba
**	or $ingres are used as possible owner for the dbproc.
**
**	Note that psq_dbpreg() first consults with RDF to see if dbproc 
**	still exists in the system catalog.  More importantly, this will
**	find out the right procedure to use in case the dba also has a 
**	procedure with the same name defined.  This is like what the local
**	does in psy_gproc().
**	
**	Currently this function doesn't handle permission.
**	
**	Modelled after psq_recreate, psy_gproc and psl0_rngent.
**
** Inputs:
**	psq_cb		- query control block.
**	sess_cb		- session control block.
**
** Outputs:
**	psq_cb
**	    .psq_mode	- query mode 
**				. PSQ_QRYDEFED if query plan already in QSF. 
**				. PSQ_EXEDBP otherwise.	Then a QTREE object 
**				  and an empty QP_OBJ will be created for dbp. 
**
** Returns:
**	E_DB_OK status if dbproc is found, error otherwise.
**
** Side Effects:
**	Allocates QSF memory for the registered dbproc object
**	if it doesn't already exist.
**
** History:
**	01-dec-92 (tam)
**	    Created.
**	11-dec-92 (tam)
**	    Use QTREE for the QSF object.
**	08-mar-93 (tam)
**	    Change logic to first search RDF for the proper owner of the procedure.
**	12-apr-93 (tam)
**	    Reuse psq_als_owner to handle owner.procedure if PSQ_OWNER_SET is set.
**	03-mar-2008 (toumi01) BUG 120040
**	    Initialize pst_flags lest we make decisions based on random memory.
**	19-Jun-2010 (kiria01) b123951
**	    Add extra parameter to psl0_rngent for WITH support.

**	    Bug #64395
**	    it is dangerous to cast a (char *) into a (DB_CURSOR_ID *) and then
**	    dereference the resulting pointer because the char ptr may not be 
**	    pointing at memory not aligned on an appopriate boundary.  Instead,
**	    we will allocate a DB_CURSOR_ID structure on the stack, initialize 
**	    it and MEcopy() it into the char array
