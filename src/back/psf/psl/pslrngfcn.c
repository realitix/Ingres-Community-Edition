/**
**
**  Name: PSLRNGFCN.C - Functions for managing range variables
**
**  Description:
**      QUEL, unlike SQL, first looks for a table name owned by the current
**	user, then by the dba.  This file contains the functions that
**	implement the search path.
**
**          psl_rngent - Enter a range variable, looking first for a table
**			 owned by the current user, then for one owned by the
**			 dba, then for one owned by $ingres (system catalog).
**
**	    psl0_rngent - like above but doesn't report table not found errors.
**
**          psl_orngent - Enter a range variable, looking for a table owned by
**			  specified user.
**
**	    psl0_orngent - like above but doesn't report table not found errors.
**	    psl_swelem - locate table amongst with list elements in range table
**
**  	Static functions:
**	    psl_syn_id	- determine id of a synonym, given its name and owner
**
**  History:
**      18-may-86 (jeff)    
**          written
**	10-may-88 (stec)
**	    Added psl_orngent.
**	12-aug-88 (stec)
**	    Modified psl0_rngent to make sure the owner is the current user
**	    or the DBA or $ingres.
**	03-oct-88 (andre)
**	    modified psl_rngent to receive and pass query mode to psl0_rngent
**	12-jan-90 (andre)
**	    modiifed psl0_rngent() to not automatiacally check tables owned by
**	    user, then dba, then $ingres.  Instead user needs to specify whether
**	    tables owned by the user (PSS_USRTBL) and/or dba (PSS_DBATBL)
**	    and/or $ingres (PSS_INGTBL) are to be checked.
**	09-apr-90 (andre)
**	    psl_rngent(), psl_orngent(), psl0_rngent() and psl0_orngent() will
**	    notify the caller if the supplied name was that of a synonym.
**	    Additionally, psl[0]_rngent() will also indicate if the object or
**	    synonym retrieved is owned by the user, DBA, or $INGRES.
**	12-sep-90 (teresa)
**	    make the following booleans become bitflags in pss_ses_flag: 
**	    pss_fips_mode
**	14-jan-92 (barbara)
**	    Included ddb.h for Star.
**	21-apr-92 (barbara)
**	    Updated for Sybil.  Pass in mask to psl0_rngent for distributed
**	    thread.  Values will be mapped to RDF masks.
**	18-nov-92 (barbara)
**	    Changed interface to psl0_orngent to pass in Star-specific flags
**	    (same as psl0_rngent).
**	03-apr-93 (ralph)
**	    DELIM_IDENT:
**	    Use pss_cat_owner instead of "$ingres"
**      23-mar-93 (smc)
**          Fixed up prototyped function pointer declarations.
**	14-jul-93 (ed)
**	    replacing <dbms.h> by <gl.h> <sl.h> <iicommon.h> <dbdbms.h>
**	13-aug-93 (andre)
**	    fixed causes of ACC warnings
**	15-sep-93 (swm)
**	    Added cs.h include above other header files which need its
**	    definition of CS_SID.
**	21-oct-93 (andre)
**	    added psl_syn_id() and made changes to psl0_[o]rngent() to invoke it
**	    if a synonym reference has been encountered in the course of parsing
**	    a user-generated dbproc
**      02-mar-95 (harpa06)
**          Bug #66070 - Changed error returned to user from E_US0847_2119 to
**          E_US0845_2117 since this error message was confusing people when 
**          non-existent temporary tables were being referenced.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	19-Jun-2010 (kiria01) b123951
**	    Add extra parameter to psl0_rngent and psl_rngent to support WITH
**	    list elements for T121. pst_swelem have been moved into gere as a
**	    static function along with pst_swelem_clone that will handle the
**	    expansions required.
**	08-Nov-2010 (kiria01) SIR 124685
**	    Rationalise function prototypes
**	15-Dec-2010 (kiria01) b124842
**	    Correct scope handling in common table expressions
**       4-Jul-2011 (hanal04) SIR 125458
**          Add DB_ERROR support (__FILE__, __LINE__) to PSF and to user
**          error functions in SCF.
**      13-Jul-2011 (hanal04) SIR 125458
**          Update cs_elog calls inline with sc0e_putAsFcn changes.

/*{
** Name: psl_rngent	- Enter a range variable
**
** Description:
**      This function enters a range variable into the range table, first
**	looking for declared global session temporary tables, then
**	looking for tables owned by the current user, then for tables owned
**	by the dba, then by $ingres. For compability reasons the session
**	temporary table search is only done if the gtt_syntax_shortcut
**	switch in config.dat is set to ON.
**
** Inputs:
**      rngtable                        Pointer to the range table
**	scope				scope that range variable can be
**					found in.
**	varname				Name of range variable
**	tabname				Name of table to look up
**	cb				session control block
**	    pss_user			Current user name
**	    pss_dba			Name of DBA
**	    pss_sessid			Session id
**	    pss_dbid			Database id
**	    pss_lang			query language
**	tabonly				TRUE means don't get info about columns
**	rngvar				Place to put pointer to range var
**	err_blk				Filled in if an error happens
**
** Outputs:
**	rngvar				Filled in with pointer to range variable
**	err_blk				Filled in if an error happened
**	caller_info			Filled in with info which may be of
**					interest to the caller
**
**	Returns:
**	    E_DB_OK			Success
**	    E_DB_INFO			Success but session table found
**	    E_DB_ERROR			Non-catastrophic failure
**	    E_DB_FATAL			Catastrophic failure
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	    Can cause RDF to allocate memory
**
** History:
**	18-may-86 (jeff)
**          written
**	4-feb-87 (daved)
**	    call psl0_rngent
**	18-feb-87 (daved)
**	    add scope for SQL.
**	03-oct-88 (andre)
**	    modified to receive and pass query mode to psl0_rngent 
**	12-jan-90 (andre)
**	    modiifed psl0_rngent() to not automatiacally check tables owned by
**	    user, then dba, then $ingres.  Instead user needs to specify whether
**	    tables owned by the user (PSS_USRTBL) and/or dba (PSS_DBATBL)
**	    and/or $ingres (PSS_INGTBL) are to be checked.
**	09-apr-90 (andre)
**	    Added a new field, caller_info, to pass info back to the caller
**	12-sep-90 (teresa)
**	    pss_fips_mode becomes bitflag in pss_ses_flag instead of being
**	    a boolean.
**	21-apr-92 (barbara)
**	    For Sybil, new interface to psl0_rngent requires a mask.
**	    Pass in default of 0.
**	12-aug-93 (andre)
**	    replace TABLES_TO_CHECK() with PSS_USRTBL|PSS_DBATBL|PSS_INGTBL.
**	    TABLES_TO_CHECK() was being used because long time ago we made an
**	    assumption that 3-tier name space will not be used when processing 
**	    SQL queries while running in FIPS mode.  That assumption proved to 
**	    be incorrect and there is no longer a need to use this macro
**	23-may-06 (toumi01)
**	    Allow session temporary tables to be referenced without the
**	    "session." in DML. This eliminates the need for this Ingres-
**	    specific extension, which is a hinderance to app portability.
**	24-aug-06 (toumi01)
**	    Rewrite "session." optional change to clean up from Karl's
**	    changes, to allow perm and temp tables to have the same name, to
**	    make the feature conditional on a config.dat parameter to handle
**	    backward compatibility issues, and to minimize extra lookups.
**	31-aug-06 (toumi01)
**	    GTT syntax shortcut is now implicitly turned on when a dgtt
*	    command is parsed without "session." specified for the name.
**	    Thus, "old style" and "new style" applications can coexist
**	    in one installation with no need for a config.dat option.

**	12-jan-90 (andre)
**	    let user specify whether tables owned by the user and/or dba and/or
**	    $ingres are to be looked for.
**	11-apr-90 (andre)
**	    Added a new field, caller_info, to pass info back to the caller
**	    it will be used to indicate if the name
**	    supplied by the user was that of a synonym + indicate if the
**	    object or synonym whose name was specified by the caller was owned
**	    by the user, DBA, or $INGRES
**	26-jun-90 (andre)
**	    if a synonym is encountered in a QUEL query, we will act as if it
**	    was never seen unless we are checking for duplicate object names in
**	    CREATE/DEFINE VIEW/RETRIEVE INTO.
**	21-apr-92 (barbara)
**	    For Sybil, pass in mask of values to be mapped into RDF values.
**	    Also, pass in session control block to pst_sent and pst_rgent
**	    and eliminate session and user id parameters.
**	11-may-92 (andre)
**	    if a table could not be looked up in the course of parsing a dbproc
**	    definition, set PSS_MISSING_OBJ in cb->pss_dbp_flags
**	18-nov-92 (barbara)
**	    Reset err_code before looking up table; otherwise old error code
**	    stays around and may be used erroneously by caller.
**	21-oct-93 (andre)
**	    If the name specified by the caller was that of a synonym and we 
**	    are parsing a definition of a non-system generated dbproc, we will 
**	    invoke psl_syn_id() to determine id of the synonym - this id will 
**	    be stored in the dbproc's independent object list so that whenever 
**	    the synonym is dropped, the dbproc will be marked dormant
**	11-feb-94 (andre)
**	    fix for bug 59707:
**	    when checking whether the object was referenced through a synonym, 
**	    we must avoid mistaking a reference to the input set of a set-input
**	    dbproc for a reference to a synonym; we can detect an input set 
**	    reference by checking whether pss_rgtype is PST_SETINPUT
**	08-apr-94 (andre)
**	    the code in this function was making an (incorrect) assumption that
**	    caller would not ask us to look for $ingres' table without asking us
**	    to look for a table owned by the current use or by the DBA.  
**	    This assumption is violated when in the course of processing 
**	    CREATE TABLE we attempt to verify that a table with a given name 
**	    is not already owned by the current user or by $ingres 
**	    (WITHOUT CHECKING WHETHER IT IS OWNED BY THE DBA.)  As a result, 
**	    an attempt by to create a table iirelation by $ingres on a 
**	    database of which $ingres is a DBA (e.g. iidbdb) does get caught 
**	    in PSF and is instead caught in DMF.  
**	   
**	    To correct the problem, we will skip checking for existence of a 
**	    table owned by DBA if the current user is the DBA AND we have 
**	    already checked for existence of the table owned by the current 
**	    user.  Similarly, we will skip checking for existence of the table 
**	    owned by $ingres if the current user is $ingres AND we checked for 
**	    existence of the table owned by the current user or the DBA is $
**	    ingres AND we checked for existence of the table owned by the DBA
**	30-apr-02 (inkdo01)
**	    Added support for PSS_SESTBL flag to request access to SQL-generated
**	    global temporary tables.
**	24-aug-06 (toumi01)
**	    For "session." optional change to handle getting all four search
**	    flags set in one go, and return E_DB_INFO if we end up finding
**	    a session temporary table.
**	31-aug-06 (toumi01)
**	    For SIR 116264 fix E_DB_WARN s.b. E_DB_INFO typo.
**	26-sep-06 (toumi01)
**	    For GTT lookup changes fix init of err_code for USRTBL search.
**	29-dec-2006 (dougi)
**	    Call to new function psl_swelem() to potentially resolve table

**	    Make sure the owner is the current user or the DBA

**	10-mar-89 (andre)
**	    DBA may search for anyone's table providing he cb->pss_dba_drop_all
**	    is set.
**	22-may-89 (andre)
**	    Further modify the above change: DBA or $ingres may search for
**	    a table not in their name space providing query mode is PSQ_DESTROY
**	    and dba_drop_all is set.
**	01-nov-89 (andre)
**	    As a part of work to bring name space up to FIPS requirements, we
**	    will no longer insist that owner of the table is present user, DBA,
**	    or $INGRES.  As a result, we will no longer be claiming that table
**	    was not found without looking for it: anyone can access anyone's
**	    table.  For DROP user.tbl, drop_obj_spec: production has code to
**	    make sure that if the table i not owned by the user, than
**	    dba_drop-all must be set, and user must be DBA or $INGRES.
**	09-apr-90 (andre)
**	    Added a new field, caller_info, to pass info back to the caller
**	    it will be used to indicate if the name supplied by the user was
**	    that of a synonym.
**	    Also set (*rngvar)->pss_var_mask to PSS_EXPLICIT_QUAL to indicate
**	    that object name was explicitly qualified by the name of its owner.
**	21-apr-92 (barbara)
**	    Pass session control block to pst_sent/pst_rgent and eliminate
**	    session and user id parameters.
**	11-may-92 (andre)
**	    if a table could not be looked up in the course of parsing a dbproc
**	    definition, set PSS_MISSING_OBJ in cb->pss_dbp_flags
**	18-nov-92 (barbara)

/*{
** Name: psl_swelem_clone - clone tree of range tables for with list element
**
** Description:
**      This function clones a WITH element and any elements it needs for a
**	full, distinct clone. This was once a part of psl_swelem but is now
**	pulled out to handle the recursive nature of expansion.
**
**	The context block passed in will be global to the recursion and
**	contains the working areas to track the cloning. It is expected that
**	the caller initialize these and will have to perform a final fixup
**	based on that returned context.
**
**	When the WITH list is parsed it is done left to right and any 'table'
**	references can also 'seen' those that have been parsed to the left.
**	The complexities occur mainly with one or more levels of WITH element
**	refering to another. Such happening requires that a new range variable
**	copy be made for every variable refered to, recursivly, so that the new
**	reference may be instantiated. This might seem to suggest that several
**	levels of reference could require a deep bushy expansion but it doesn't
**	as each separate level of WITH element will already have had its own
**	nested references expanded thus each new reference replicates a flat
**	tree. This is important as it simplifies the tracking of the vno refs
**	and also the join ids.
**
**	Initially, given a query tree bearing range varaiable, we scan it for
**	its root nodes to determine the ranges we need to clone - which we do.
**	We also note the join ids in the tree and assign new values for the
**	post call fixup.
**	We then create the new entry and add this to the user range list.
**	Having created the range entry and knowing that all pre-requisite range
**	variables have been cloned, we can duplicate any tree fixing up refs as
**	calculated in the initial pass.
**	Then it just remains for the caller to do a single pass on the range
**	table to apply the inner and outer map fixups.
**
** Inputs:
**	orig			Range table entry to clone.
**	ctx			Pointer to control block shared by this and all
**				recursive calls. (PST_SWELEM_CLONE_CTX)
**	  .cb			Pointer to session control block
**	  .rngtable		Pointer to user range table.
**	  .qry_mode		Mode of query
**	  .pjoin_id		Pointer to the current max_join_id for
**			        assigning new join ids without clashing.
**	  .rng_vars		This is the address of a vector of pointers
**				to the entries in the user range table but
**				setup for ordinal access. Must be initialised
**				to index .rngtable on entry & this routine will
**				keep up to date with additions.
**	  .vno_map		Pending update map for cloning vno entries.
**				On external call, this must be set to -1s
**	  .jid_map		Pending update map for cloning joinids.
**				On external call, this must be set to -1s
**
** Outputs:
**	ctx			Pointer to control block shared by this and all
**				recursive calls. (PST_SWELEM_CLONE_CTX)
**	  .cb			Pointer to session control block. Memory stream
**				data will be updated
**	  .rngtable		Pointer to user range table will be updated
**				if clone occurs.
**	  .rngvar		Place to put pointer to new range
**	  .err_blk		DB_ERROR block for propagation	
**	  .pjoin_id		Pointer to the current max_join_id for
**			        assigning new join ids without clashing.
**	  .rng_vars		This is the address of a vector of pointers
**				to the entries in the user range table but
**				setup for ordinal access.
**	  .vno_map		Pending update map for cloning vno entries.
**				This map will be supplemented as additions are

**				entries and what they became.
**	  .jid_map		Pending update map for cloning joinids.
**				This map will be supplemented as additions are
**				made. On exit, this will reflect all the join id
**				changes *in progress*. Note that the inner and
