/**
**
**  Name: psyrules.c - Rule processor
**
**  Description:
**	This module contains the rule processor.  This processor modifies
**	the query to add rule firing statements.
**
**  Defines:
**	psy_rule 	- Apply rules to a statement.
**	psy_drule	- Define a rule.
**	psy_krule	- Destroy a rule.
**
**
**  History:
**	09-mar-89 (neil)
**	    Written for Terminator/rules.
**	18-apr-89 (jrb)
**	    Prec field cleanups and pst_node interface change for decimal
**	    project.
**	20-apr-89 (neil)
**	    Modified psy_rules for cursor support.
**	09-may-89 (neil)
**	    Added saving of rule name for tracing.
**	08-sep-89 (neil)
**	    PSY_CB field psy_rule is now  psy_tuple.psy_rule.
**	26-sep-89 (neil)
**	    Defined PSY_QUEL_RULES - allows rule application in QUEL.
**	05-dec-90 (ralph)
**	    copy rule owner name to pst_cprocstmt (b34531)
**	14-jan-92 (barbara)
**	    Included ddb.h for Star.
**	03-aug-92 (barbara)
**	    Initialize RDF_CB by calling pst_rdfcb_init before calling RDF.
**	30-jul-92 (rickh)
**	    FIPS CONSTRAINTS:  changed DBR_T_TABLE to DBR_T_ROW.
**	           also changed uses of dbr_column to dbr_columns; 
**                 it is now a bitmap instead of an i2.   (rblumer)
**	16-nov-92 (rblumer)
**	    Initialize upd_cols even for non-UPDATE statements, as now
**	    pst_ruledup always looks at its value when passed a non-zero filter.
**	08-dec-92 (anitap)
**	    Changed the order of #includes of header files for CREATE SCHEMA.
**	15-dec-92 (wolf) 
**	    ulf.h must be included before qsf.h
**	21-dec-92 (rblumer)
**	    In psy_drule, suppress text for system-generated rules
**	    (i.e., don't store text in iiqrytext catalog);
**	    in psy_rules, put statement-level rules on a separate rule list,
**	    and put system-generated rules at the end of each rule list.
**	17-mar-93 (rblumer)
**	    in psy_rules, attach the stmt-level rule list to the end of the
**	    row-level rule list, to simplify processing in OPC;
**	    added static function attach_rule_lists.
**	11-jun-93 (rblumer)
**	    in psy_drule, Store RDF_INVALIDATE return status in loc_status;
**	    otherwise we can overwrite the error status of an earlier call.
**	14-jul-93 (ed)
**	    replacing <dbms.h> by <gl.h> <sl.h> <iicommon.h> <dbdbms.h>
**	10-aug-93 (andre)
**	    fixed causes of compiler warnings
**      16-sep-93 (smc)
**          Added/moved <cs.h> for CS_SID. Added history_template so we
**          can automate this next time.
**	23-May-1997 (shero03)
**	    Save the rdr_info_blk after UNFIX
**	12-dec-2000 (somsa01)
**	    Changed references from STcasecmp() to STbcompare(), as the
**	    ST changes have not been crossed into the ingres25 code line.
**      01-Dec-2000 (hanal04) Bug 100680 INGSRV 1123
**          Updating rules fired by updates can loop indeterminately
**          if the update causes the row to move position in the table.
**          Flag the use of the prefetch solution unless it has been
**          disabled by setting the config parameter rule_upd_prefetch
**          to OFF. This change reworks inkdo01's change 448530.
**	10-Jan-2001 (jenjo02)
**	    Supply session's SID to QSF in qsf_sid.
**	    Added *PSS_SELBLK parm to psf_mopen(), psf_mlock(), psf_munlock(),
**	    psf_malloc(), psf_mclose(), psf_mroot(), psf_mchtyp(),
**	    pst_treedup().
**	04-Oct-2002 (gygro01) b108628 / ingsrv 1872
**	    Statement level rule with qualification and wihtout dbp
**	    parameters defined won't apply the qualification due to
**	    implementation of stmt-level-rules in qef.
**	    Flagging such rules as row level rules in order to
**	    get the qualification applied correctly (psy_rule()).
**	    Anyway does not make much sense to use a stmt-level-rule,
**	    if no params needs to be passed to the procedure.
**      22-feb-2006 (stial01)
**          psy_rules() Set flag if system generated rule (b115765)
**      30-aug-06 (thaju02)
**          In psy_rules(), if delete query and PSS_RULE_DEL_PREFETCH, 
**          then set PST_DEL_PREFETCH bit in the pst_pmask. (B116355)
**      01-apr-2010 (stial01)
**          Changes for Long IDs
**	08-Nov-2010 (kiria01) SIR 124685
**	    Rationalise function prototypes
**       4-Jul-2011 (hanal04) SIR 125458
**          Add DB_ERROR support (__FILE__, __LINE__) to PSF and to user
**          error functions in SCF.
**      13-Jul-2011 (hanal04) SIR 125458
**          Update cs_elog calls inline with sc0e_putAsFcn changes.

** Name: psy_drule	- Define a rule.
**
**  INTERNAL PSF call format: status = psy_drule(&psy_cb, &sess_cb);
**
**  EXTERNAL call format:     status = psy_call(PSY_DRULE, &psy_cb);
**
** Description:
**      This routine stores the definition of a table-type and time-type rule
**	in the system table iirule and iiqrytext.  If there's a tree
**	associated with the table-type rule (a parameter list and/or a
**	qualification) then the tree is stored in iitree.
**
**	The actual work of storing the rule is done by RDF and QEU.  Note
**	that the rule name is not yet validated within the user scope and
**	QEU may return a "duplicate rule" error.
**
** Inputs:
**      psy_cb
**	    .psy_tuple.psy_rule		Rule tuple to insert.  All
**					user-specified fields of this
**					parameter are filled in by the
**					grammar.  Internal fields (tree and
**					text ids) are filled in just before
**					storage in QEU when the ids are
**					constructed.  The owner of the rule
**					is filled in this routine from
**					pss_user before storing.
**          .psy_qrytext                Id of query text as stored in QSF.
**	    .psy_istree			TRUE if there is a tree.
**          .psy_intree                 Query tree representing parameter list
**					and/or qualification of rule if
**					psy_istree is set.
**					integrity if psy_istree is set.
**	sess_cb				Pointer to session control block.
**
** Outputs:
**      psy_cb
**	    .psy_error.err_code		Filled in if an error happens:
**		E_PS0D18_QSF_LOCK 	  Cannot lock text or tree.
**		E_PS0D19_QSF_INFO	  Cannot get information for text/tree.
**		E_PS0D1A_QSF_DESTROY	  Could not destroy text or tree.
**		E_PS0903_TAB_NOTFOUND	  Table not found.
**		Generally, the error code returned by RDF and QEU
**		qrymod processing routines are passed back to the caller.
**
**	Returns:
**	    E_DB_OK, E_DB_WARN, E_DB_ERROR, E_DB_FATAL
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	Stores query tree in iitree, query text in iiqrytext, rule tuple in
**	iirule identifying the rule.  Does a DMF alter table to indicate
**	that the table has rules on it.
**
** History:
**	09-mar-89 (neil)
**	   Written for Terminator/rules.
**	12-mar-90 (andre)
**	    set rdr_2types_mask to 0.
**      22-may-90 (teg)
**          init rdr_instr to RDF_NO_INSTR
**	03-aug-92 (barbara)
**	    Invalidate tableinfo from RDF's cache.
**	30-jul-92 (rickh)
**	    FIPS CONSTRAINTS:  changed DBR_T_TABLE to DBR_T_ROW.
**	16-nov-92 (rblumer)
**	    Initialize upd_cols even for non-UPDATE statements, as now
**	    pst_ruledup always looks at its value when passed a non-zero filter.
**	21-dec-92 (rblumer)
**	    Suppress text for system-generated rules
**	    (i.e., don't store text in iiqrytext catalog).
**	11-jun-93 (rblumer)
**	    Store RDF_INVALIDATE return status in loc_status, not status,
**	    otherwise we can overwrite the error status of an earlier call.
**	 7-jan-94 (swm)
**	    Bug #58635
**	    Added PTR cast for qsf_owner which has changed type to PTR.
**	18-jul-96 (inkdo01)
**	    Removed code which suppressed query text of system-generated
**	    rules. This syntax has now been externalized and is ok to 
**	    store on the catalog.

/*{
** Name: psy_rules	- Apply rules modifications to statement tree.
**
** Description:
**      This function applies rules processing to the current statement.
**	The statement is checked for valid rule-applicable statements and
**	rules that apply to the current statement are attached to one of the
**	lists maintained in sess_cb.  Rule processing is done as a part of
**	qrymod since rules can now be defined on views.
**
**	If rules can apply and the current table has the rules bit set
**	(DMT_RULE), rule tuples satisfying this statement are extracted from
**	RDF. "Satisfying" means the rule refers to the current table, the
**	rule statement is the same as the current statement, and, if 
**	specific column(s) were listed in the firing condition, then pne or more
**	of them are referenced in the target list of this statement.
**
**	Each rule tuple extracted may also have a condition and/or parameter
**	list associated with it.  These subordinate values are also extracted
**	from RDF via the tree pointed at within the rule tuple.
**
**	If the rule has conditions associated with it this routine does
**	not try to check the condition, as syntactic comparisons alone would
**	not be enough.  For example, fire rule R when C = 10; this routine
**	does not check if the expression C = 9+1 is or is not 10.
**
**	Even though procedure names (or aliases) are read out of the rule
**	tuple, this routine does not verify that the procedure does exist
**	or are loaded.  This would have too high an overhead for rules that
**	are not actually fired.  Mid-execution procedure recreation is
**	handled elsewhere.
**
**	After reading the rule tuple, a statement tree is built which may
**	check a run-time condition, and then call a procedure.  If more than
**	one rule can apply, another rule statement construct is added to
**	the appropriate list (see note below).  This routine "pushes" them
**	in order that they were read, thus they will probably be executed
**	in reverse order that they were returned from RDF.
**
**	Rule lists built by (possibly multiple) invocations of psy_rules() will
**	be coalesced (system-generated row-level rules will be appended to
**	user-defined ones and system-generated statement-level rules will be
**	appended to user-defined ones) in pst_header() or psl_init_dbp_stmt().
**	For prepared statements, row- and statement-level rule lists will be
**	coalesced in pst_execute(); otherwise they will be coalesced in
**	pst_header() or psl_init_dbp_stmt().  Before handing over a query tree
**	to OPF, pst_after_stmt will point at the list of row-level rules with
**	statement-level rules attached at the end, and pst_statementEndrules
**	will point at the beginning of the list of statement-level rules.
**
**	The trees extracted from RDF may reference OLD and/or NEW column
**	values (PST_BEFORE/PST_AFTER).  Even though OLD cannot apply
**	to an INSERT statement, and NEW cannot apply to a DELETE
**	statement, psy_rules will not traverse the tree to fix up the
**	node types, as OPC already handles these cases.
**	
**   Note:  Multiple rule lists
**
**      As mentioned above, we will distinguish four types of rules:
**	user-defined row-level, system-generated row-level, user-defined
**	statement-level and system-generated statement-level.  Separate lists
**	will be maintained in sess_cb until we are done with qrymod and are
**	building the statement node because rules now can be defined on views as
**	well as base tables.
**	before we return.
**
**   Cursor Note:
**
**	When processing cursor statements on the initial DELETE or UPDATE
**	statement we retrieve all rules and construct ALL the DELETE and
**	UPDATE statement trees (as described above).  Since they are all
**	built we tag each rule statement with the type (and optional column)
**	of the original rule.  This tag (allocated out of the cursor memory
**	stream) will allow us to later filter out unused rules, without having
**	to reaccess RDF.  All rules read during the initial invocation are
**	attached to the cursor CB (and the "rules checked" indicator is set).
**	After initial invocation all other cursor statements that access rules
**	will just duplicate the applicable rule statements by filtering out
**	the unused rules (via pst_ruledup).
**
** Restrictions:
**	1. Only SQL - this can be relaxed by not validating the language.
**	   This restriction is only applied if PSY_QUEL_RULES is undefined.
**	2. Only DELETE [CURSOR], INSERT and UPDATE [CURSOR] statements
**	   provide rules.
**
** Inputs:
**	sess_cb				Session control block.  Various fields
**					are used to fill in the RDF message
**					requests and for validating current
**					information.
**	    .pss_crsr			If a cursor then must be set.
**	qmode				Query mode of current query.  Current
**					checks are for:
**					    PSQ_APPEND, PSQ_DELETE, PSQ_UPDATE,
**					    PSQ_REPCURS, PSQ_DELCURS
**	root				Root of current query tree.  This
**					may be traversed.
** Outputs:
**	sess_cb				Session control block:
**	    .pss_row_lvl_usr_rules	user-defined row-level after rules 
**					will be	attached to this list
**	    .pss_row_lvl_sys_rules	system-generated row-level after rules 
**					will be	attached to this list
**	    .pss_stmt_lvl_usr_rules	user-defined statement-level after 
**					rules will be attached to this list
**	    .pss_stmt_lvl_sys_rules	system-generated statement-level after
**					rules will be attached to this list
**	    .pss_row_lvl_usr_before_rules user-defined row-level before rules 
**					will be	attached to this list
**	    .pss_row_lvl_sys_before_rules system-generated row-level before
**					rules will be attached to this list
**	    .pss_stmt_lvl_usr_before_rules user-defined statement-level before
**					rules will be attached to this list
**	    .pss_stmt_lvl_sys_before_rules system-generated statement-level 
**					before rules will be attached to this 
**					list
**	err_blk.err_code		Filled in if an error happened:
**		E_RD0002_UNKNOWN_TBL	  RDF error for table not found.
**		E_PS0903_TAB_NOTFOUND	  Table's gone (concurrent activity)
**	        E_PS0D33_RULE_PARAM	  Param count/list mismatch
**		Errors from RDF & other PSF utilities
**
**	Returns:
**	    E_DB_OK			Success
**	    E_DB_ERROR			Failure
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	Allocate rule trees and attach to cursor CB.
**
** History:
**	08-mar-89 (neil)
**	    Written for Terminator/rules.
**	18-apr-89 (neil)
**	    Modified to support rules applied to cursors.
**	09-may-89 (neil)
**	    Added saving of rule name for tracing.
**	26-sep-89 (neil)
**	    Allow conditional rule application in QUEL.
**	12-mar-90 (andre)
**	    set rdr_2types_mask to 0.
**      22-may-90 (teg)
**          init rdr_instr to RDF_NO_INSTR
**	12-jun-90 (andre)
**	    if dbproc is owned by the creator of the rule, we will allow
**	    referring to the dbproc using private alias (i.e. regardless of
**	    whether the dbproc is "grantable").  If, on the other hand, the
**	    dbproc is not owned by the creator of the rule, we will inssit that
**	    it must be grantable by specifying public alias.
**	05-dec-90 (ralph)
**	    copy rule owner name to pst_cprocstmt (b34531)
**	29-sep-92 (andre)
**	    RDF may choose to allocate a new info block and return its address
**	    in rdf_info_blk - we need to copy it over to pss_rdrinfo to avoid
**	    memory leak and other assorted unpleasantries
**	30-jul-92 (rblumer)
**	    changed uses of dbr_column to dbr_columns; 
**          it is now a bitmap instead of an i2.
**	07-nov-92 (andre)
**	    we will no longer be creating private aliases for dbproc QPs
**	    FIX_ME: when recreating a dbproc fired by a rule, we need to verify
**	    that the creator of the rule may grant EXECUTE on the dbproc; this
**	    requires that PSF be told who owns the rule, and then a few assorted
**	    changes in PSF to take care of privilege checking (quite similar to
**	    what happens now if a user is trying to grant EXECUTE on a dbproc)
**	09-nov-92 (rblumer)
**	    Initialize new PST_STATEMENT nodes to all zeros (thereby setting
**	    new pst_statementEndRules field (and other fields) to NULL)
**	21-dec-92 (rblumer)
**	    put statement-level rules on a separate rule list,
**	    and put system-generated rules at the end of each rule list.
**	04-jan-93 (andre)
**	    If processing DELETE/UPDATE WHERE CURRENT OF, sess_cb->pss_rules
**	    will be set to point to the list of applicable rules;
**	    As a result of adding support for rules on views, for
**	    DELETE/INSERT/UPDATE on a view, it may already be pointing at
**	    rules which were defined on that view or on some of its underlying
**	    views;
**	    notice that pss_rules gets reset to NULL before processing any
**	    statement that may take us here (i.e. to psy_rules())
**	10-Feb-93 (Teresa)
**	    Changed RDF_GETINFO to RDF_READTUPLES for new RDF I/F
**	03-mar-93 (andre)
**	    For statement-level rules, we need to obtain a copy of an 
**	    IIPROCEDURE tuple describing the dbproc and set 
**	    pst_callproc->pst_tuple to point at it
**	17-mar-93 (rblumer)
**	    attach the stmt-level rule list to the end of the row-level
**	    rule list, to simplify processing in OPC.
**	07-apr-93 (andre)
**	    Rules for cursor UPDATE/DELETE will no longer be attached to the
**	    cursor CB proper.  Instead, they will be attached to elements of a
**	    list of PSC_TBL_DESCRs based on the table/view on which they are
**	    defined
**
**	    For cursor UPDATE/REPLACE, we will search for PSC_TBL_DESCR with id
**	    matching that in sess_cb->pss_resrng; for cursor DELETE, we will
**	    simply point at the first entry in the list (which must correspond
**	    to the table/view on which the permit was defined and whose
**	    description was read in by psq_dlcsrrow()).  For cursor DELETE, we
**	    will loop through all entries in the list looking for applicable
**	    rules.  For cursor UPDATE/REPLACE, we will search only rules
**	    hanging off the current PSC_TBL_DESCR entry.  For all other queries,
**	    we will ask RDF for rules defined on the table/view whose
**	    description is pointed at by pss_resrng.
**
**	    Another minor change is that during the first pass through
**	    psy_rules() for an updatable cursor, we will allocate statement
**	    nodes using cursor's memory stream which should save us the expense
**	    of calling pst_ruledup() to copy them from ostream into cursor's
**	    stream and then recursively calling psy_rules() to copy them from
**	    cursor stream back into ostream.
**	08-apr-93 (andre)
**	    psy_rules() will no longer be in business of coalescing rule lists.
**	    This is done for two reasons:
**		- rules can now be defined on views, so coaleascing rule lists
**		  before we have attached all of them will result in rule lists
**		  not being built correctly
**		- when processing PREPARE, we must avoid coalescing row- and
**		  statement-level rules because in pst_execute() we will call
**		  pst_ruledup() to duplicate rule lists and coalescing the
**		  original lists will result in a row-level rule list containing
**		  both row-level and statement-level rules which will probably
**		  confuse the hell out of OPF
**	26-jun-93 (andre)
**	    if in the process of scanning rules that apply to a view we come
**	    across one that was created to enforce CASCADED CHECK OPTION, we
**	    will attach it to the query tree ONLY IF another rule enforcing
**	    CASCADED CHECK OPTION on a view for which the current view is a
**	    generally underlying view has not been attached to the query tree.
**	    Once a rule enforcing CASCADED CHECK OPTION has been attached to the
**	    tree, we will set PSS_ATTACHED_CASC_CHECK_OPT_RULE in pss_var_mask
**	    of the range variable representing the view to ensure that rules
**	    enforcing CASCADED CHECK OPTION on this view's underlying views do
**	    not get attached to the query tree
**	23-May-1997 (shero03)
**	    Save the rdf_info_blk after UNFIX
**	02-Jun-1997 (shero03)
**	    Update the pss_rdrinfo after calling rdf
**	17-nov-00 (inkdo01)
**	    Changed pst_ptype to pst_pmask and check for rule update prefetch

**      01-Dec-2000 (hanal04) Bug 100680 INGSRV 1123
**          Changed pst_ptype to pst_pmask and set rule update prefetch
