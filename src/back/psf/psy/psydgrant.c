/**
**
**  Name: PSYDGRANT.C - Function used to define a grant of a privilege
**			on a database object.
**
**  Description:
**      This file contains functions necessary to define a grant of
**	a privilege on a table.
**
**          psy_dgrant		-   Grant a privilege.
**	    psy_permit_ok	-   Check if a user may grant permit on
**				    a table
**	    psy_dbp_priv_check	-   Reparse a dbproc owned by the current user
**				    to determine if he may grant permit on it
**	    psy_tbl_grant_check -   Determine if the user may grant specified
**				    privileges on a given table or view
**	    psy_prvmap_to_str	-   Convert a privilege map into a string
**	    psy_init_rel_map	-   Initialize a structure holding a map of
**				    relations
**	    psy_attmap_to_str	-   conmvert a map of attribute into an
**				    attribute list
**
**	This file also contains the following static functions:
**
**	    psy_tbl_to_col_priv -   translate table-wide privilege on a view
**				    into column-specific privilege on the
**				    underlying table
**	    psy_colpriv_xlate	-   translate column-specific privilege on a
**				    view into column-specific privilege on the
**				    underlying table
**	    psy_dbp_ev_seq_perm	-   complete the actions required to insert
**				    permits granting specified privilege on a
**				    dbevent or a dbproc to all grantees
**	    psy_mark_sublist	-   mark beginning of sublists of independent
**				    objects/privileges by inserting sublist
**				    headers into the lists
**	    psy_recursive_chain -   determine if a dbproc is being invoked
**				    recursively; this is required to avoid
**				    getting trapped in an infinite loop when
**				    processing dbprocs involved in recursive
**				    call chains + to enable us to correctly
**				    determine whether dbprocs involved in
**				    recursive call chains are grantable
**	    psy_dupl_dbp	-   determine if a descriptor for a given dbproc
**				    has already been created and if so, massage
**				    the tree to ensure that it never contains
**				    more than one descriptor for a given dbproc
**	    psy_prvtxt		-   build query text for a permit conveying a
**                        	    column-specific privilege
**	    psy_pr_cs_privs	-   print description of a column-specific
**                                  privilege
**
**  History:
**      30-apr-87 (stec)
**          written
**	05-aug-88 (andre)
**	    modified to handle granting permit on a database procedure
**	06-feb-89 (ralph)
**	    modified to use DB_COL_WORDS when resetting all dbp_domset bits
**	    modified to use DB_COL_BITS  when   setting all dbp_domset bits
**	05-mar-89 (ralph)
**	    GRANT Enhancements, Phase 1:
**	    Copy grantee type from psy_gtype into dbp_gtype.
**	08-may-89 (ralph)
**	    Initialize reserved field to blanks (was \0)
**	04-jun-89 (ralph)
**	    Initialize dbp_fill1 to zero
**	    Corrected unix portability problems
**	01-nov-89 (ralph)
**	    Correct problem with CREATE SECURITY_ALARM:  If all/select
**	    and public specified, this was mistaken here as grant all/select
**	    to public.
**	02-nov-89 (neil)
**	    Alerters: Allow privileges for events.
**	06-feb-90 (andre)
**	    Added psy_permit_ok(), psy_dbp_grant_check(), and
**	    psy_view_grant_check().
**	18-jun-90 (andre)
**	    Unfix RDF cache entries in psy_view_grant_check().
**	08-aug-90 (ralph)
**	    Initialize new fields in iiprotect tuple
**	14-sep-90 (teresa)
**	    pss_catupd becomes bitflag in pss_ses_flag instead of a boolean.
**	14-jan-92 (barbara)
**	    Included ddb.h for Star.
**	15-jun-92 (barbara)
**	    Changed interface to pst_sent; set rdr_r1_distrib flag.
**	28-oct-92 (robf)
**	    When a SECURITY ALARM is created on a user, handling (non)
**	    quoting of user name, also make sure when BY PUBLIC is
**          specified any IF/WHEN clauses are preserved appropriately.
**	06-nov-1992 (rog)
**	    Include <ulf.h> before <qsf.h>.
**	16-nov-1992 (pholman)
**	    C2: replace obsolete calls to qeu_audit with psy_secaudit 
**	    and include <sxf.h>.
**	18-mar-93 (rblumer)
**	    Made psy_check_privs non-static, changed grant_all parameter into
**	    a flags field, and added no-grant-option flag & no-error flag.
**	    All this is to allow the function to be used for checking
**	    REFERENCES privilege for referential constraints.
**	05-apr-93 (anitap)
**	    Added a check for CREATE SCHEMA. If an user issues a GRANT 
**	    statement for issuing permits on a bunch of tables and if he 
**	    doesn't have sufficient privilege on one of the tables, psy_dgrant()
**	    continues processing the permits for the next table in the list.
**	    For CREATE SCHEMA, we want to return an error and abort the 
**	    statement.  
**	03-apr-1993 (ralph)
**	    DELIM_IDENT: Use pss_cat_owner instead of "$ingres"
**	17-jun-93 (andre)
**	    undo Anita's change from (05-apr-93).  If a user cannot grant some
**	    privilege, we return a warning - not an error - thus CREATE SCHEMA
**	    should not be rolled back if one or more GRANTs inside of it fail
**	    because the usser lacks needed privileges
**	14-jul-93 (ed)
**	    replacing <dbms.h> by <gl.h> <sl.h> <iicommon.h> <dbdbms.h>
**	10-aug-93 (andre)
**	    fixed causes of compiler warnings
**      16-sep-93 (smc)
**          Added/moved <cs.h> for CS_SID. Added history_template so we
**          can automate this next time.
**	18-nov-93 (stephenb)
**	    Include psyaudit.h for prototyping.
**	11-oct-93 (swm)
**	    Bug #56448
**	    Made psf_display() portable. The old psf_display() took a variable
**	    number of variable-sized arguments. It could not be re-written as
**	    a varargs function as this practice is outlawed in main line code.
**	    The problem was solved by invoking a varargs function, TRformat,
**	    directly.
**	    The psf_display() function has now been deleted, but for flexibilty
**	    psf_display has been #defined to TRformat to accomodate future
**	    change.
**	    All calls to psf_display() changed to pass additional arguments
**	    required by TRformat:
**	        psf_display(psf_scctrace, 0, trbuf, sizeof(trbuf) - 1, ...)
**	    this emulates the behaviour of the old psf_display() except that
**	    the trbuf must be supplied.
**	11-feb-94 (swm)
**	    Bug #59614
**	    My previous integration (bug #56448) erroneously introduced a
**	    block of code during integrate merging. This had the side-effect
**	    of failing the WGO runall test because US088E is issued instead
**	    of PS055[12] when a user specifies some privileges which they
**	    may not grant.
**	10-Jan-2001 (jenjo02)
**	    Supply session's SID to QSF in qsf_sid.
**	    Added *PSS_SELBLK parm to psf_mopen(), psf_mlock(), psf_munlock(),
**	    psf_malloc(), psf_mclose(), psf_mroot(), psf_mchtyp(),
**	    psl_rptqry_tblids(), psl_cons_text(), psl_gen_alter_text(),
**	    psq_tmulti_out(), psq_1rptqry_out(), psq_tout(), psy_mark_sublist().
**	17-Jan-2001 (jenjo02)
**	    Short-circuit calls to psy_secaudit() if not C2SECURE.
**      13-Mar-2003 (hanal04) Bug 109786 INGSRV 2122
**          Prevent invalid privileges being set on VIEWs when a GRANT ALL
**          is issued.
**      01-apr-2010 (stial01)
**          Changes for Long IDs
**      01-oct-2010 (stial01) (SIR 121123 Long Ids)
**          Store blank trimmed names in DMT_ATT_ENTRY
**	21-Oct-2010 (kiria01) b124629
**	    Use the macro symbol with ult_check_macro instead of literal.
**	08-Nov-2010 (kiria01) SIR 124685
**	    Rationalise function prototypes
**       4-Jul-2011 (hanal04) SIR 125458
**          Add DB_ERROR support (__FILE__, __LINE__) to PSF and to user
**          error functions in SCF.
**      13-Jul-2011 (hanal04) SIR 125458
**          Update cs_elog calls inline with sc0e_putAsFcn changes.

/*{
** Name: psy_dgrant	- Execute GRANT.
**
**  INTERNAL PSF call format: status psy_dgrant(&psy_cb, sess_cb);
**
** Description:
**	Given all of the parameters necessary to define a grant on a data-
**	base object (table, dbevent, or a database procedure), psy_dgrant()
**	will store the permission in the system tables.
**	This will include storing the query tree in the tree table,
**	storing the text of the query in the iiqrytext table (really done by
**	the QSM), storing a row in the protect table, and issuing an "alter
**	table" operation to DMF to indicate that there are permissions on the
**	given object.
**	Note the processing for dbprocs & events is different from that needed
**	for tables, so each is done as an autonomous block inside psy_dgrant().
**	This procedure is called for SQL language only.
**
** Inputs:
**      psy_cb
**	    .psy_qrytext		Id of query text as stored in QSM.
**          .psy_opctl			Bit map of defined   operations
**          .psy_opmap                  Bit map of permitted operations
**          .psy_terminal               Terminal at which permission is given
**					(blank if none specified)
**          .psy_timbgn                 Time of day at which the permission
**					begins (minutes since 00:00)
**          .psy_timend                 Time of day at which the permission ends
**					(minutes since 00:00)
**          .psy_daybgn                 Day of week at which the permission
**					begins (0 = Sunday)
**          .psy_dayend                 Day of week at which the permission ends
**					(0 = Sunday)
**	    .psy_grant			PSY_TGRANT if GRANT on a table,
**					PSY_PGRANT if grant on a dbproc,
**					PSY_SQGRANT if grant on a sequence,
**					PSY_EVGRANT if grant on an event,
**					PSY_LGRANT if grant on a location (code
**					is yet to be written)
**	    .psy_gtype			Grantee type:
**					DBGR_USER if users (and/or PUBLIC) were
**					specified
**					DBGR_GROUP if groups were specified
**					DBGR_APLID if application ids were
**					specified
**	    .psy_tblq			head of table queue
**	    .psy_colq			head of column queue
**	    .psy_usrq			head of user (or applid/group) queue
**	    .psy_u_numcols		number of elements in the list of
**					attribute ids of columns to which UPDATE
**					privilege will/will not apply
**	    .psy_u_col_offset		offset into the list of attribute ids
**					associated with a given PSY_TBL entry of
**					the first element associated with UPDATE
**					privilege
**	    .psy_i_numcols		number of elements in the list of
**					attribute ids of columns to which INSERT
**					privilege will/will not apply
**	    .psy_i_col_offset		offset into the list of attribute ids
**					associated with a given PSY_TBL entry of
**					the first element associated with INSERT
**					privilege
**	    .psy_r_numcols		number of elements in the list of
**					attribute ids of columns to which
**					REFERENCES privilege will/will not apply
**	    .psy_r_col_offset		offset into the list of attribute ids
**					associated with a given PSY_TBL entry of
**					the first element associated with
**					REFERENCES privilege
**	    .psy_noncol_qlen		length of first iiqrytext
**	    .psy_flags
**	  PSY_EXCLUDE_UPDATE_COLUMNS	attribute ids associated with UPDATE
**					privilege indicate to which columns
**					UPDATE privilege will not apply
**	  PSY_EXCLUDE_INSERT_COLUMNS	attribute ids associated with INSERT
**					privilege indicate to which columns
**					INSERT privilege will not apply
**	PSY_EXCLUDE_REFERENCES_COLUMNS	attribute ids associated with REFERENCES
**					privilege indicate to which columns
**					REFERENCES privilege will not apply
**	PSY_PUBLIC			privilege(s) being granted to PUBLIC
**					(possibly, in addition to other users)
**	PSY_ALL_PRIVS			GRANT ALL [PRIVILEGES] was specified,
**					i.e. privileges being granted were not
**					named explicitly
**	sess_cb				Pointer to session control block
**					(Can be NULL)
**
** Outputs:
**      psy_cb
**          .psy_txtid                  Id of query text as stored in the
**					iiqrytext system relation.
**	    .psy_error			Filled in if error happens
**	Returns:
**	    E_DB_OK			Function completed normally.
**	    E_DB_WARN			Function completed with warning(s);
**	    E_DB_ERROR			Function failed; non-catastrophic error
**	    E_DB_FATAL			Function failed; catastrophic error
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	    Stores text of query in iiqrytext relation, query tree in tree
**	    relation, row in protect relation identifying the permit.  Does
**	    an alter table DMF operation to indicate that there are permissions
**	    on the object.
**
** History:
**	29-apr-87 (stec)
**          written
**	05-aug-88 (andre)
**	    modified to handle granting permit on a database procedure.
**	06-feb-89 (ralph)
**	    modified to use DB_COL_WORDS when resetting all dbp_domset bits
**	    modified to use DB_COL_BITS  when   setting all dbp_domset bits

**	    Initialize reserved field to blanks (was \0)
**	04-jun-89 (ralph)
**	    Initialize dbp_fill1 to zero

**	01-nov-89 (ralph)
**	    Correct problem with CREATE SECURITY_ALARM:  If all/select

**	    to public.
**	02-nov-89 (neil)
**	    Alerters: Allow privileges for events.
**	12-mar-90 (andre)
**	    set rdr_2types_mask to 0.
**      22-may-90 (teg)
**          init rdr_instr to RDF_NO_INSTR
**	08-aug-90 (ralph)
**	    Initialize new fields in iiprotect tuple
**	17-jun-91 (andre)
**	    A number of changes were made to beautify the
**	    GRANT/CREATE SECURITY_ALARM query text stored in IIQRYTEXT.  In
**	    particular, we will do away with blank padding for names of users,
**	    objects and columns.
**	24-jun-91 (andre)
**	    IIPROTECT tuples for table permits will contain exactly one
**	    privilege.  IIQRYTEXT template built for table-wide privileges
**	    contains a placeholder for a privilege name which will be filled in
**	    with each of the table-wide privileges being granted, one at a time.
**	    PSY_CB.psy_opmap will be set to correspond with privilege name
**	    stored in the IIQRYTEXT permit.
**	25-jun-91 (andre)
**	    we will start storing IIPROTECT and IIQRYTEXT tuples for
**	    ALL/RETRIEVE_TO_ALL permits on tables.
**	    ALL_TO_ALL will result in four tuples while RETRIEVE_TO_ALL will
**	    result in one tuple.  In both cases, we will continue setting the
**	    ALL_TO_ALL and RETRIEVE_TO_ALL bits in IIRELATION.
**	17-jul-91 (andre)
**	    If a permit specifies more than one privilege (possibly WGO), set
**	    RDF_SPLIT_PERM in rdr_instr to instruct qeu_cprot() to create
**	    multiple permit tuples.
**	06-aug-91 (andre)
**	    The following now applies to GRANT on tables and views:
**		unless the object on which a permit is being granted is a base
**		table owned by the current user (can grant any permit) or this
**		is an object to which a kludge described below applies, we will
**		verify that the user can, indeed, grant privileges on the given
**		object.
**		KLUDGE: for the time being we allow a user with CATUPD to grant
**			permits on catalogs and a user who is a DBA to grant
**			permits on extended catalogs.
**	25-sep-91 (andre)
**	    when processing a grant on a dbproc owned by another user, we need
**	    to open a memory stream since pst_dbpshow() will try to allocate a
**	    PSS_DBPINFO structure.
**	30-sep-91 (andre)
**	    when processing a grant on a dbproc owned by the current user, we
**	    need to verify that the dbproc is grantable.  Depending on the
**	    information found in IIPRIV and IIPROCEDURE this may be
**	    accomplished as follows:
**		- (once (if) we start storing in IIPROCEDURE an indicator of
**		  whether the dbproc is grantable,) if IIPROCEDURE indicates
**		  that the dbproc is grantable, we are done
**		- else (once we start storing a list of independent objects for
**		  a dbproc in IIPRIV) if IIPRIV contains a list of independent
**		  objects for this dbproc, if the user can grant access on all
**		  of dbproc's independent objects, we are done
**		else reparse the dbproc to determine if it is grantable.
**	    As of now (9/30/91) the only option open to us is to reparse the
**	    dbproc, but this is likely (no, no, it IS GOING) to change soon.
**	07-oct-91 (andre)
**	    if a dbproc has been parsed successfully, insert a
**	    PSQ_DBPLIST_HEADER elements into the lists of independent objects
**	    and privileges; otherwise insert a PSQ_INFOLIST_HEADER element to
**	    indicate that the following sublist does not describe independent
**	    objects for a dbproc but may contain useful information.
**	10-oct-91 (andre)
**	    Two more changes for processing of GRANT ON PROCEDURE:
**		- until now we have not been checking if the dbprocs owned by
**		  the current user which were used inside the dbprocs which were
**		  reparsed were themselves grantable;  descriptions of these
**		  dbprocs will be removed from the independent object list and
**		  moved (temporarily) into the internal list of dbprocs
**		  grantability of which must be verified;
**		- once it is known that a dbproc is (or is not) grantable, an
**		  entry will be placed into the privilege list to avoid trying
**		  to rediscover this information again; if the dbproc was
**		  mentioned in the GRANT statement, a corresponding privilege
**		  entry will be placed into the special INFOLIST at the end of
**		  the privilege list, while for dbprocs whose descriptors were
**		  removed from the independent object list for some dbproc P,
**		  will be inserted into the independent privilege list for P
**		  (I am going to think more about this last point, since if we
**		  decide to store the dependency information immediately after
**		  successful reparsing of a dbproc, nothing will be gained by
**		  storing the privilege descriptor into the corresponding
**		  privilege sublist, instead we may choose to store it into the
**		  INFOLIST sublist mentioned above.)
**	28-feb-92 (andre)
**	    permits being created on dbevents will be handled separately from
**	    those being created on dbprocs because
**		- we will be splitting dbevent perms specifying more than one
**		  privilege and
**		- we will verify here that the user may, indeed, grant the
**		  specified privilege(s) (we no longer insist that only the
**		  owner of the event may grant privileges on it.)
**	07-jul-92 (andre)
**	    if granting one or more of DELETE/INSERT/UPDATE on a view and
**	    psy_tbl_grant_check() indicates that privileges being granted depend
**	    on privileges on an underlying table or view, populate structures
**	    representing independent privilege list and pass them along to
**	    qeu_cperm().
**	07-jul-92 (andre)
**	    DB_PROTECTION tuple will contain an indicator of how the permit was
**	    created, i.e. whether it was created using SQL or QUEL and if the
**	    former, then whether it was created using GRANT statement.  Having
**	    this information will facilitate merging similar and identical
**	    permit tuples.
**	14-jul-92 (andre)
**	    semantics of GRANT ALL [PRIVILEGES] is different from that of
**	    CREATE PERMIT ALL in that the former (as dictated by SQL92) means
**	    "grant all privileges which the current auth id posesses WGO"
**	    whereas the latter (as is presently interpreted) means "grant all
**	    privileges that can be defined on the object" which in case of
**	    tables and views means SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE.
**	    psy_tbl_grant_check() (function responsible for determining whether
**	    a user may grant specified privilege on a specified table or view)
**	    will have to be notified whether we are processing GRANT ALL.  Its
**	    behaviour will change as follows:
**	      - if processing GRANT ALL and psy_tbl_grant_check() determines
**	        that the user does not possess some (but not all) of the
**		privileges passed to it by the caller it will not treat it as an
**		error, but will instead inform the caller of privileges that the
**		user does not posess,
**	      - if processing GRANT ALL and psy_tbl_grant_check() determines
**	        that the user does not possess any of the privileges passed to
**		it by the caller it will treat it as an error
**	      - if processing a statement other than GRANT ALL and
**	        psy_tbl_grant_check() determines that the user does not possess
**		some of the privileges passed to it by the caller it will treat
**		it as an error
**	15-jul-92 (andre)
**	    if user specified GRANT ALL [PRIVILEGES], psy_tbl_grant_check() may
**	    reduce the set of privileges being granted.  we will pass 
**	    psy_tbl_grant_check() the address of tbl_wide_privs instead of
**	    psy_tbl_grant_check itself and use the value returned to us as the
**	    map of all privileges which we will grant, i.e. under some
**	    circumstances psy_opmap may contain more privileges than we are
**	    going to grant on a given table
**	18-jul-92 (andre)
**	    we will no longer tell qeu_cprot() (through rdf_update()) that a
**	    user is creating ALL/SELECT TO PUBLIC.  qeu_scan_perms() (a fucntion
**	    invoked by qeu_cprot()) will determine whether the combination of
**	    existing permits and the permits being created give PUBLIC a SELECT
**	    (DMT_RETRIEVE_PRO) or SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE (DMT_ALL_PROT).
**	19-jul-92 (andre)
**	    if user specified PUBLIC as a grantee (or in CREATE SECURITY_ALARM
**	    statement), psy_gtype will no longer be set to DBGR_PUBLIC.
**	    Instead, PSY_CB.psy_flags will have PSY_PUBLIC set
**	21-jul-92 (andre)
**	    make changes to support EXCLUDING clause in GRANT statement
**	13-aug-92 (andre)
**	    a further refinement of GRANT ALL [PRIVILEGES] processing: if a user
**	    can only GRANT UPDATE on some columns of specified table or view,
**	    he will be allowed to do so.
**	15-aug-92 (barbara)
**	    For table grants, invalidate base object's infoblk from the RDF
**	    cache.
**	16-sep-92 (andre)
**	    privilege map gets built using bitwise operators, so care should be
**	    exercised when accessing privilege maps using BTnext(), BTset(),
**	    BTclear() and the like.  The safest bet is probably to NOT DO IT.
**	28-oct-92 (robf)
**	    When a SECURITY ALARM is created on a user, handle (non)quoting
**	    of user name 
**	07-dec-92 (andre)
**	    added support for GRANT REFERENCES
**	11-dec-92 (andre)
**	    A number of PSY_CB elements have been renamed to improve readability
**	    of code.
**	05-apr-93 (anitap)
**	    Added a check for CREATE SCHEMA. If an user issues a GRANT 
**	    statement for issuing permits on a bunch of tables and if he 
**	    doesn't have sufficient privilege on one of the tables, psy_dgrant()
**	    continues processing the permits for the next table in the list.
**	    For CREATE SCHEMA, we want to return an error and abort the 
**	    statement.  
**	17-jun-93 (andre)
**	    undo Anita's change from (05-apr-93).  If a user cannot grant some
**	    privilege, we return a warning - not an error - thus CREATE SCHEMA
**	    should not be rolled back if one or more GRANTs inside of it fail
**	    because the usser lacks needed privileges
**	17-jun-93 (andre)
**	    changed interface of psy_secaudit() to accept PSS_SESBLK
**	5-jul-93 (robf)
**	    Pass security label to psy_secaudit
**	17-aug-93 (andre)
**	    identifier placeholders are now of length DB_MAX_DELIMID.  
**	    Names of schemas, objects and grantees will be expressed using 
**	    regular identifier if that's how they were expressed by the user - 
** 	    otherwise they will be expressed using delimited identifiers
**	11-oct-93 (swm)
**	    Bug #56448
**	    Declared trbuf for psf_display() to pass to TRformat.
**	    TRformat removes `\n' chars, so to ensure that psf_scctrace()
**	    outputs a logical line (which it is supposed to do), we allocate
**	    a buffer with one extra char for NL and will hide it from TRformat
**	    by specifying length of 1 byte less. The NL char will be inserted
**	    at the end of the message by psf_scctrace().
**	24-nov-93 (robf)
**         Removed xORANGE block, now handled consistently in B1/C2 modes
**	 7-jan-94 (swm)
**	    Bug #58635
**	    Added PTR cast for qsf_owner which has changed type to PTR.
**	28-jan-94 (andre)
**	    set object type (T or V) in IIPROTECT tuples describing 
**	    security_alarms
**	10-may-02 (inkdo01)
**	    Add code for sequence privileges.
**	24-feb-03 (inkdo01)
**	    Add mask parm to psy_gsequence call.
**      13-Mar-2003 (hanal04) Bug 109786 INGSRV 2122
**          A GRANT ALL will set DB_COPY_INTO and DB_COPY_OUT privileges
**          but these are not valid for a VIEW. Ensure these flags are 
**          turn off in  tbl_wide_privs if the object is a VIEW.
**	11-nov-2004 (gupsh01)
**	    If grant all privilages is added on a view then fixed the flags
**	    added to remove the COPY_INTO and COPY_FROM privileges on a view.
**	16-nov-2004 (gupsh01)
**	    Rollback previous change to remove COPY_INTO and COPY_FROM.

** Name: psy_permit_ok - determine if the user may GRANT/CREATE/DEFINE a permit
**			 on a table/view
**
** Description:
**	This function will return TRUE if present user may GRANT/CREATE/DEFINE a
**	permit and FALSE otherwise.  As described below, a permit may be
**	granted/created if at least one of the following holds:
**	    1) Object is catalog or an extended catalog, and user has catalog
**	       update priviledge;
**	    2) Object is an extended catalog, and user is a DBA
**	    3) Object is owned by the user.
**	For DEFINE PERMIT (3) in the above restriction is changed to
**	    3) Object is owned by the user WHO IS THE DBA
**
** Input:
**	obj_mask		mask describing the object
**	    DMT_CATALOG		object is a catalog
**	    DMT_EXTENDED_CAT	object is an extended catalog
**	    otherwise		object is a regular table/view
**
**	cb			PSF session CB
**	    pss_lang		language of the query
**	    pss_ses_flag	flag describing session attributes
**		PSS_CATUPD	session posesses catalog update privilege
**	    pss_user		current DBMS session user identifier
**	    pss_dba		dba identifier
**
**	obj_owner		identifier of the owner of the object
**
** Output:
**	none
**
** Returns:
**	TRUE if the user may GRANT/CREATE/DEFINE a permit on the object; FALSE
**	otherwise
**
** Side effects:
**	none
**	
** History:
**
**	29-jul-91 (andre)
**	    this function will no longer be called for GRANT.  Eventually, it
**	    will be phased out since all DDL statements (except for GRANT) will
**	    be disallowed on objects not owned by the current user.
**	20-feb-92 (andre)
**	    this function can now be called during processing of DEFINE PERMIT
**	    the difference between CREATE PERMIT and DEFINE PERMIT is that
**	    unless the object is a catalog and the session posesses CATUPD, the
**	    user MUST be the DBA.

    **	    D = user is a DBA

    **	    CU= user has catalog update privilege
    **	    + = LOGICAL OR
    **	    * = LOGICAL AND
    **	Presently, in order issue GRANT the following must hold:
    **	    (E+C) * CU + E * (D+I) + (T+C) * O * (D+I)
    **	We will change it making sure that semantics of
    **	accessing catalogs is not altered, i.e.
    **	(E+C) * CU + E * (D+I) + C * O * (D+I) + T * O
    **	Note that we eased the restriction on non-catalogs.
    **	Further note that C * O * (D+I) <==> C * O since
    **	catalogues are owned by $ingres.  Finally,
    **	E * (D+I) <==> E * (O+D) since extended catalogues are
    **	owned by $ingres.
    **	So the final restriction is:
    **	(E+C) * CU + E * (O+D) + C * O + T * O =
    **	(E+C) * CU + E * D + O * (C+E+T) =
    **	(E+C) * CU + E * D + O
    **	since all objects are either E or C or T,
    **	i.e. C+E+T == TRUE.
    **
    **	if called when processing a QUEL query (DEFINE PERMIT), the restriction
    **	is slightly modified since in QUEL only the DBA may define a permit
    **	unless the object is a catalog and the session posesses CATUPD,
    **	hence for QUEL the restriction is:
    **	    (E+C) * CU + D * (E * D + O) = (E+C) * CU + D * (E + O)

**	building IIQRYTEXT text for this object and for each grantee named in
**	the statement.  That done, it will invoke RDF_UPDATE to actually insert

**
** Input:
**	rdf_cb			RDF control block

**		rdr_querytxt	beginning of IIQRYTEXT template
**	psy_cb			PSY control block
**	    psy_grant		type of object on which privileges are being
**				granted
**		PSY_PGRANT	granting dbproc privileges
**		PSY_EVGRANT	granting dbevent privileges
**	    psy_noncol_qlen	length of IIQRYTEXT template;
**				note that the text passed to QEU is likely to be
**				shorter since we trim trailing blanks off object
**				and user names
**	    psy_noncol_obj_name_off
**				offset into IIQRYTEXT template where

**	    psy_noncol_grantee_off
**				offset into the original template where
**				'grantee_name' is to be written
**	    psy_opmap		map of privileges being granted
**		DB_GRANT_OPTION	privileges are being granted WGO
**	    psy_user		if grant_to_public, default grantee name will be
**				found here
**	    psy_usrq		if granting privilege(s) to groups, roles, or
**				individual users (possibly in addition to
**				PUBLIC) this will point to a list of grantees
**	psy_tbl			entry describing the object permits on which are
**				being granted
**	    psy_tabnm		name of the dbproc/dbevent privilege(s) on
**				which are being granted
**	    psy_owner		owner of the dbproc/dbevent privilege(s) on
**				which are being granted
**	    psy_tabid		id of the dbproc/dbevent privilege(s) on which

**	protup			DB_PROTECTION tuple to be completed and passed
**				to QEU
**	buf			text to be inserted between the name of the

** Outputs:

** Name: psy_recursive_chain - determine if the dbproc invocation represents a
**			       recursive call and build/massage lists
**			       representing recursive call chains
**
** Description:
**	Starting at the current node in the list of dbproc headers ("cur_node"),
**	search its ancestors to determine if the dbproc being considered is
**	called recursively. If so, dbproc headers asociated with dbprocs
**	involved in the recursive call chain will be linked together (if they
**	are not already linked.)  This is done to facilitate determining when we
**	can claim that a dbproc involved in a recursive call chain is, in fact,
**	active or grantable.
**
**	Note that within a "family" of headers for the dbproc named in the GRANT
**	statement and all dbprocs invoked (directly or indirectly) by it, there
**	may be multiple recursive chains some of which may be disjoint while
**	others may intersect or contain each other.  All nodes (inclusively)
**	lying between the "cur_node" and the highest node (i.e. such node that
**	all other nodes in the recursive call chain are its descendants) H in
**	this recursive call chain must be linked together for the purposes of
**	determining whether dbprocs with which they are associated are
**	grantable.  A case when the newly discovered recursion chain is disjoint
**	from any other recursion chain discovered so far is uninteresting (we
**	will simply link together all nodes between "cur_node" and H.)  If two
**	chains are not disjoint, we will merge them to produce a single chain
**	with its root node being the highest of root nodes of chains being
**	merged.
**
** Input:
**	cur_node		dbproc header associated with a dbproc whoich
**				invokes a dbproc for which we are trying to
**				determine if is called recursively
**	dbpid			id of the dbproc for which we are trying to
**				determine if is called recursively
**
** Output:
**	none
**
** Side effects:
**	if the dbproc is being called recursively, will manipulate recurisive
**	call chain list(s)
**
** Returns:
**	TRUE if the dbproc is being called recursively; FALSE otherwise

/*
** Name:    psy_dbp_status  - given a list of objects on which the dbproc
**			      depends, determine if its owner posesses
**			      privileges required for the specified operation
**
** Description:
**	This function may be invoked to verify that the user may grant
**	privilege(s) on a given dbproc owned by him (i.e. verify that the dbproc
**	is grantable) or to verify that the user may execute a dbproc owned by
**	him or to create a new dbproc (i.e. verify that the dbproc is active.) 
**
**	If the user is attempting to GRANT privilege(s) on his own dbproc, we
**	will verify that he may grant privileges required to execute every
**	statement of the dbproc.  This is fairly straightorward for privileges
**	on tables, views, dbevents, and dbprocs owned by other users.  For
**	dbprocs owned by the current user which are invoked (directly or
**	indirectly) by the dbproc on which privilege(s) are being granted,
**	however, this means establishing that they are "grantable".  In the best
**	case, this can be determined by examining IIPROCEDURE.db_mask[0].
**	Failing that, we will be forced to either reparse the dbproc (if no
**	independent object/privilege list can be found in IIDBDEPENDS/IIPRIV),
**	or to verify that the user may grant every privilege found in the
**	dbproc's independent privilege list + that every dbproc owned by the
**	current user which was found in the dbproc's independent object list is
**	grantable.
**
**	If user is attempting to execute a dbproc owned by him which is not
**	marked as active or to create a new dbproc, we must establish that he
**	posesses privileges required to execute every statement in that dbproc.
**	This is fairly straightorward for privileges on tables, views, dbevents,
**	and dbprocs owned by other users.  For dbprocs owned by the current user
**	which are invoked (directly or indirectly) by the dbproc which user is
**	attempting to create or execute, however, this means establishing that
**	they are at least "active".  In the best case, this can be determined by
**	examining IIPROCEDURE.db_mask[0].  Failing that, we will be forced to
**	either reparse the dbproc (if no independent object/privilege list can
**	be found in IIDBDEPENDS/IIPRIV), or to verify that the user posesses
**	every privilege found in the dbproc's independent privilege list + that
**	every dbproc owned by the current user which was found in the dbproc's
**	independent object list is active
**
**	Information obtained in the course of processing dbproc definitions
**	(i.e. the independent object/privilege lists) will be inserted in
**	IIDBDEPENDS and IIPRIV to avoid having to rediscover this information in
**	the future.  Information obtained in the course of processing dbprocs'
**	independent object/privilege lists (i.e. whether the dbproc is active or
**	grantable) will be entered into IIPROCEDURE to avoid having to
**	rediscover this information in the future.
**	
**	Special care will be exercised in dealing with recursive dbproc
**	invocations (expecially recursive call chains) to avoid getting stuck in
**	infinite loop or to incorrectly declare a given dbproc active or
**	grantable.  Comments in the body of this function describe problems
**	posed by recursive call chains and how we will go about dealing with
**	them.
**
** Input:
**	dbp_descr		description of the dbproc for which we need to
**				determine whether it is active and/or grantable
**	    psy_tabid		dbproc id
**	    psy_tabnm		dbproc name
**	sess_cb			PSF session block
**	    pss_indep_objs
**		psq_objs	if processing [re]CREATE PROCEDURE, will point
**				to the list of independent objects for the
**				dbproc being [re]created; NULL otherwise
**		psq_objprivs	if processing [re]CREATE PROCEDURE, will point
**				to the list of independent object-wide
**				privileges for the dbproc being [re]created;
**				NULL otherwise
**		psq_colprivs	if processing [re]CREATE PROCEDURE, will point
**				to the list of independent column-specific
**				privileges for the dbproc being [re]created;
**				NULL otherwise
**	grant_dbprocs		if qmode==PSQ_GRANT, will point to the first
**				element in the list of dbprocs mentioned in
**				GRANT statement; NULL otherwise
**	qmode			mode of the query beinbg processed
**	    PSQ_GRANT		GRANT ON PROCEDURE - must establish that the
**				dbproc is grantable
**	    PSQ_CREDBP		CREATE PROCEDURE - must establish that the
**				dbproc is at least active
**	    PSQ_EXEDBP		recreate dbproc for execution by its owner -
**				must establish that the dbproc is at least
**				active
**
** Output:
**	dbp_mask		mask describing whether a dbproc is active or
**				grantable
**	    0			we cannot guarantee that the user posesses
**				privilege(s) required for the operation
**	    DB_ACTIVE_DBP	we are [re]creating a dbproc and it is ACTIVE
**	    DB_ACTIVE_DBP |
**	    DB_DBPGRANT_OK	we are processing GRANT and user posesses all
**				requried privileges
**
**	err_blk			filled in if an error occurs
**
** Return:
**	E_DB_{OK,ERROR}
**
** Side effects:
**	allocates memory, then releases it before exiting
**
** History:
**
**	19-mar-92 (andre)
**	    segregated from psy_dgrant() to enable reuse of the code when
**	    processing dbproc [re]creation.
**	03-may-92 (andre)
**	    Added support for trace point ps133.
**	19-may-92 (andre)
**	    removed psy_cb from the parameter list, added grant_dbprocs and
**	    err_blk;
**	    PSQ_CB will be allocated on stack and initialized before calling 
**	    psy_dbp_priv_check().
**	21-may-92 (andre)
**	    if we are processing GRANT ON PROCEDURE and the current dbproc, P1,
**	    was not marked as grantable in IIPROCEDURE but we have determined
**	    that it is, in fact, grantable, we must set PSY_DBPROC_IS_GRANTABLE
**	    bit in PST_TBL.psy_mask describing P1.  This is necessary since the
**	    user may have specified multiple dbprocs in this GRANT statement,
**	    and some subsequent dbproc, say P2, may involve P1.  If we fail to
**	    set PSY_DBPROC_IS_GRANTABLE in PST_TBL.psy_mask describing P1, we
**	    will mistakenly claim that P2 is ungrantable (because we build a
**	    list of dbprocs "known to be grantable/ungrantable" based on
**	    PSY_TBL entries for dbprocs which have already been processed)
**	25-jun-92 (andre)
**	    if there is an independent object/privilege list for the dbproc
**	    bneing [re]created, turn on DB_DBP_INDEP_LIST in dbp_mask[0]
**	26-jun-92 (andre)
**	    If IIPROCEDURE.dbp_mask1 indicated that the user may lack some
**	    required privileges on the dbproc but we have established that
**	    he/she posesses them, call RDF_UPDATE to modify
**	    IIPROCEDURE.dbp_mask1
**	09-sep-92 (andre)
**	    removed cache_flushed from the interface - psy_dbp_priv_check()
**	    always gets "fresh" cache entries
**	29-sep-92 (andre)
**	    RDR_2* masks over rdr_2types_mask got renamed to RDR2_*
**	17-jun-93 (andre)
**	    changed interface of psy_secaudit() to accept PSS_SESBLK
**	11-oct-93 (swm)
**	    Bug #56448
**	    Declared trbuf for psf_display() to pass to TRformat.
**	    TRformat removes `\n' chars, so to ensure that psf_scctrace()
**	    outputs a logical line (which it is supposed to do), we allocate
**	    a buffer with one extra char for NL and will hide it from TRformat
**	    by specifying length of 1 byte less. The NL char will be inserted
**	    at the end of the message by psf_scctrace().
**	30-jul-96 (inkdo01)
**	    Changed to resurrect "setinput" bit for db_mask[0] which got lost
**	    in all this other turmoil - needed for temptable proc parms.
**	19-june-06 (dougi)
**	    Same deal for DBP_DATA_CHANGE, used to validate BEFORE triggers.
**	29-march-2008 (dougi)
**	    And once more for ROW_PROC flag.

		**
		**	In the interest of efficiency, I would like to ensure

		**	this may not come at the expense of loosing information.
		**	Below you may find a description of the algorithm which
		**	will be used to accomplish this task and an informal
		**	justification of why it will not break everything.
		**
		**	Let DBP be the dbproc for which we were asked to
		**	determine whether it is grantable/active (i.e. the
		**	dbproc pointed to by root_dbp).
		**	Let DBP1 and DBP2 be two different dbprocs in the tree
		**	rooted in DBP (note that it is possible that one of
		**	DBP1, DBP2 may be DBP.)
		**	Let DBP3 be a dbproc invoked by both DBP1 and DBP2
		**	Suppose DBP1 was encounterd before DBP2 in the course of
		**	traversing the tree rooted in DBP.
		**	
		**	If by the time we encounter DBP3 in the independent
		**	object list associated with DBP2 it has not been
		**	determined whether he posesses required privileges on
		**	DBP3, one of the following must be true:
		**	
		**	  (1) the first node representing DBP3 (i.e. the node
		**	      which is the child of DBP1) has not been
		**	      processed yet - this implies that DBP3's parent
		**	      (i.e. DBP1) is also DBP2's ancestor or
		**	  (2) DBP3 is involved in a recursive call chain
		**	      root of which is DBP2's ancestor (otherwise the
		**	      recursive call chain involving DBP3 would have
		**	      been processed by now) and is either DBP1 or
		**	      DBP1's ancestor
		**
		**	If (1) is true, I claim that we can safely move DBP3
		**	from DBP1's children list to DBP2's children list
		**	without introducing any errors into the algorithm used
		**	to determine when a given dbproc is grantable/active:
		**
		**	  - if DBP3 in not involved in any recursive call
		**	    chains, its ancestors will continue to depend on it
		**	    because they depend on DBP2; if it turns out that
		**	    DBP3 recursively invokes any of DBP2's ancestors
		**	    (possibly DBP1 itself), recursive call chain will
		**	    correctly represent dependencies existing between
		**	    the recursively called dbprocs
		**
		**	If (2) is true, I claim that we can simply build a
		**	recursive call chain from DBP2 to the root of the chain
		**	to which DBP3 belonged.  This will ensure that we will
		**	not try to make conclusions about DBP2's being
		**	grantable/active until all nodes in the recursive call
		**	chain in which DBP3 was involved are processed
		**
		**	(I hope you are convinced ... now, could you please
		**	convince me?)  
		**
		**	By the way, the case described in the beginning of this
		**	diatribe (archaic: prolonged discourse) falls under
		**	category (1), so the tree will be transformed to look as
		**	follows:
		**	
		**	    P1

**	14-oct-91 (andre)
**	    written
**	04-mar-92 (andre)
**	    before unfixing RDF object check the II_PROCEDURE tuple to see
**	    whether the dbproc is marked as grantable and/or active:
**		if it is marked as grantable,
**		    we will set PSS_DBPGRANT_OK in sess_cb->pss_dbp_flags to
**		    indicate to psy_dgrant() that the dbproc is grantable and no
**		    further checking will be required
**		else if it is marked as active,
**		    we will build the independent object/privilege list based on
**		    info in IIDBDEPENDS and IIPRIV and verify that the user
**		    posesses all required privileges WGO
**		else
**		    we will reparse the dbproc to determ,ine whether itis
**		    grantable and insert the independent object/privilege
**		    information into IIDBDEPENDS and IIPRIV and mark the dbproc
**		    as ACTIVE and, if upon completing reparsing PSS_DBPGRANT_OK
**		    is set in sess_cb->pss_dbp_flags, as grantable
**	20-mar-92 (andre)
**	    changed function to enable its use to determine if a user may
**	    [re]CREATE PROCEDURE owned by him as well as GRANT ON PROCEDURE
**	    owned by him
**	21-may-92 (andre)
**	    must reset sess_cb->pss_retry to PSS_REPORT_MSGS after the first
**	    attempt at psq_parseqry() to ensure that subsequent error messages
**	    are reported to the user
**	26-jun-92 (andre)
**	    having assembled a list of independent objects and privileges, call
**	    RDF to have QEF insert the list into IIDBDEPENDS/IIPRIV and update
**	    IIPROCEDURE.dbp_mask1 to indicate that catalogs contain a list of
**	    independent objects and privileges for the dbproc
**	30-jun-92 (andre)
**	    if IIPROCEDURE.dbp_mask1 indicates that the dbproc is dormant but
**	    there is an independent object/privilege list associated with it,
**	    call RDF to get the privilege list and verify that the user posesses
**	    them (WGO, if necessary); then call RDF to obtain the dbprocs on
**	    which the current dbproc depends and enter them into independent
**	    object list which will be returned to the caller
**	10-aug-92 (andre)
**	    when passing independent object/privilege list to qeu_dbp_status(),
**	    make sure that only descriptors pertaining to this dbproc are
**	    passed, i.e. if save_tail indicates that there independent
**	    object/privilege lists contain elements in addition to those
**	    pertaining to the current dbproc, we will temporarily separate these
**	    other elements from the list
**	09-sep-92 (andre)
**	    (1) before calling psq_parseqry() we will ensure that
**	        PSS_REFRESH_CACHE is set in pss_retry, thus allowing us to
**		remove code that retries psq_parseqry() with fresh cache
**	    (2) remove cache_flushed from the interface since it is no longer
**	        useful (as a side-effect of (1))
**	    (3) before calling psq_parseqry() ensure that PSS_REPORT_MSGS is
**	        reset, so that errors (if any) which occur during reparsing of
**		the dbproc will be placed into the error log but not displayed
**		on the screen
**	01-sep-93 (andre)
**	    if after parsing a dbproc which was marked dormant but now appears 
**	    to be active we have a list of independent objects/privileges to be
**	    inserted into IIPRIV, we must also pass to qeu_dbp_status() id of 
**	    a base table (if any) on which the dbproc depends
**	15-nov-93 (andre)
**	    init sess_cb->pss_flattening_flags to 0 before calling 
**	    psq_parseqry() to reparse a dbproc definition
**	13-jan-94 (andre)
**	    psy_gproc() will no longer issue an error message if the dbproc is 
**	    not found - instead it will become the responsibility of the caller
**	    to decide whether and which message needs to be issued
**	11-oct-93 (swm)
**	    Bug #56448
**	    Declared trbuf for psf_display() to pass to TRformat.
**	    TRformat removes `\n' chars, so to ensure that psf_scctrace()
**	    outputs a logical line (which it is supposed to do), we allocate
**	    a buffer with one extra char for NL and will hide it from TRformat
**	    by specifying length of 1 byte less. The NL char will be inserted
**	    at the end of the message by psf_scctrace().
**      20-Nov-08 (wanfr01)
**          Bug 121252
**          Use new PSS_PARSING_GRANT flag to indicate to the parser that
**          the 'RECREATE' has no input set because it is run via a grant
**          statement

**	 (1) - X is a base table owned by U1, or
**	 (2) - X is a view owned by U1 which was determined to be

**	 (3) - X is a view owned by U1 which was determined to be
**	       "always grantable" and updateable (updateable is meant in a very
**	       narrow sence, i.e. single-relation view with no UNION,
**	       aggregates, or DISTINCT) at creation time (for the time being
**	       we will not store an indicator of whether a view is updateable,
**	       so this is a moot point) and ACT is INSERT, DELETE, or UPDATE, or
**	 (4) - X is a view owned by U1 and ACT is SELECT and U1 may grant SELECT
**	       privilege on every object used in the view definition, or
**	 (5) - X is a view owned by U1 and ACT is INSERT or UPDATE and for every
**	       updateable column named in the GRANT/CREATE PERMIT statement U1 
**	       may grant ACT on the underlying column of the underlying object
**	       Y, or
**	 (6) - X is a view owned by U1 and ACT is DELETE and U1 may grant
**	       DELETE on the underlying object of X, or
**	 (7) - X is an object (table or view) owned by another user U2 and U1
**	       was given privilege specifying <action> ACT on X WGO
**
**	For (1) and (2) no processing besides obtaining object description from
**	RDF will be required.
**	
**	For (3) we need to unravel the view definition to verify that it is,
**	indeed, updateable.
**
**	For (4) we will obtain a list of independent privileges for the view
**	(thay are stored in IIPRIV at view creation time) and verify that the
**	user may grant all of them
**
**	For (5) we will unravel view definition (only underlying views will be
**	unravelled, i.e. we will not pay any attention to the objects used
**	outside of the outermost from-list of the view definition) and verify
**	that the user may grant privileges on all specified columns which are
**	updateable.
**
**	For (6) we will unravel view definition (only underlying views will be
**	unravelled, i.e. we will not pay any attention to the objects used
**	outside of the outermost from-list of the view definition) and verify
**	that the user may GRANT DELETE on the view's underlying table.
**
**	For (7) we will verify that the user may grant specified privileges on
**	the specified object

** History:
**	03-jul-92 (andre)
**	    rewrote once more to take advantage of the view's independent
**	    privilege list stored in IIPRIV if a user is attempting to
**	    grant select on hiw view which is not marked "always grantable"
**	    (case (4) above) + made changes so that privileges required for
**	    INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE would agree with SQL92.
**	14-jul-92 (andre)
**	    if user specified ALL [PRIVILEGES], we will determine which
**	    of the privileges the user may grant and prevent him from granting
**	    the rest of the privileges; only if the user may not grant any of
**	    the privileges, we will generate an error.  This is how SQL92
**	    defines semantics of ALL PRIVILEGES, so if you don't like it, take
**	    it up with X3H2.  As a part of the change, tbl_wide_privs was
**	    changed from (i4) to (i4 *)
**	13-aug-92 (andre)
**	    if the user specified ALL [PRIVILEGES], UPDATE privilege may need
**	    to be trnasferred into the column-specific privilege map if it turns
**	    out that the user may GRANT UPDATE on a subset of columns
**	29-sep-92 (andre)
**	    RDF may choose to allocate a new info block and return its address
**	    in rdf_info_blk - we need to copy it over to pss_rdrinfo to avoid
**	    memory leak and other assorted unpleasantries
**	10-Feb-93 (Teresa)
**	    Changed RDF_GETINFO to RDF_READTUPLES for new RDF I/F
**	13-aug-93 (andre)
**	    instead of using vtree_pst_agintree which is TRUE if a view 
**	    definition involves an aggregate ANYWHERE in the definition, we will
**	    check whether PST_AGG_IN_OUTERMOST_SUBSEL is set in 
**	    vtree->pst_mask1.  As a result we will no longer prevent users from
**	    granting DELETE,INSERT,UPDATE on views involving aggregates OUTSIDE
**	    of outermost subselect of the view definition
** 	03-nov-93 (andre)
**	    if processing GRANT which was issued inside CREATE SCHEMA statement,
**	    pass that bit of information to psy_check_privs() which will then 
**	    return an error (rather than just issuing a message) if the user 
**	    issuing GRANT statement inside CREATE SCHEMA on a table or view 
**	    possesses no privileges whatsoever on that object.  This agrees 
**	    with our new and improved reading of SQL92 that considers such 
**	    condition an "Access Rule violation."  
**	
**	    My rationale for handling user errors while processing GRANT in 
**          different manner depending on whether GRANT statement was issued 
**          inside CREATE SCHEMA follows.
**
**	    If processing GRANT statement issued outside of CREATE SCHEMA, I 
**	    propose that we do NOT return an error:
**	      -	ability to grant privilege on multiple objects using a single 
**		GRANT statement is our extension; traditionally, if a user was 
**		unable to grant a privilege on some object, we would issue and 
**		error message and try to proceed on to the next one.  
**
**		Since ability to grant privileges on other users' objects was 
**	  	not available until 6.5, out actions are not, strictly speaking,
**		constrained by the ubiquitous backward compatibility, but I 
**		feel that there is no harm in keeping behaviour of GRANT 
**		statement consistent with previous releases insofar as 
**		contunuing processing even if privilege cannot be granted on 
**		some object is concerned.  
**
**		If a user used SQL92-compliant syntax (i.e. specifying 
**		privileges to be granted on exactly one object), then our 
**		behaviour will be perfectly compliant with SQL92 (i.e. SQLSTATE
**		will be set to 42000 and no privilege will be granted).  If, on 
**		the other hand, user took advantage of our extension and 
**		specified multiple objects on which privileges are to be 
**		granted, we will continue the current policy of granting 
**		privileges on those objects on which the current user may grant
**		them and issuing error messages for the rest.
**
**	    On the other hand, not aborting a CREATE SCHEMA statement containing
**	    GRANT statement(s) attempting to grant privileges on objects in 
**	    other schemas which either do not exist or on which the current 
**	    user possesses no privileges whatsoever, is clearly non-compliant 
**	    with SQL92 and may at some point result in a failure to pass a NIST
**	    test.  Therefore, user errors while processing GRANT statement 
**	    issued inside CREATE SCHEMA will result in an error being returned 
**	    to the caller which will lead to rollback of the entire CREATE 
**	    SCHEMA statement
**	11-oct-93 (swm)
**	    Bug #56448
**	    Declared trbuf for psf_display() to pass to TRformat.
**	    TRformat removes `\n' chars, so to ensure that psf_scctrace()
**	    outputs a logical line (which it is supposed to do), we allocate
**	    a buffer with one extra char for NL and will hide it from TRformat
**	    by specifying length of 1 byte less. The NL char will be inserted
**	    at the end of the message by psf_scctrace().

/*
** Name: psy_check_privs - verify that the user posesses required
**			   privileges
** Description:
**    
**    Given a range table entry describing an object and a map of
**    table wide privileges required on the object and a structure
**    describing column-specific privileges and columns on which they
**    are required, this function will scan IIPROTECT to verify that
**    the user possesses the specified privileges WGO.
**
** Input:
**     rngvar			range table entry describing the
**     				table/view in question
**     privs_to_find		address of a map of required privileges
**     indep_tbl_wide_privs	map of required table-wide privileges
**     indep_col_specific_privs	structure descring required
**     				column-specific privileges
**     sess_cb			PSF session CB
**     ps131			an indicator of whether trace point
**     				ps131 has been set
**     grant_obj_id		id of the object named by user (e.g.
**     				the table/view on which a user wishes to 
**				grant privilege(s))
**     flags			one of:
**	    PSY_PRIVS_GRANT_ALL 
**				set if processing GRANT and the user specified 
**				ALL [PRIVILEGES];
**     				   
**     	    PSY_PRIVS_NO_GRANT_OPTION
**     			        set if WITH GRANT OPTION is not required
**     			        for these privileges (used for checking
**     			        REFERENCES priv for referential constraints)
**     				   
**	    PSY_PRIVS_DONT_PRINT_ERROR
**     			        don't print out grant-specific errors
**     			        (used when checking REFERENCES priv for
**     			        referential constraints) 
**
**	    PSY_GRANT_ISSUED_IN_CRT_SCHEMA
**				processing GRANT issued inside CREATE SCHEMA 
**				statement; if a user attempting to grant 
**				privilege(s) possesses no privileges on the 
**				object (which, in SQL92 vernacular, constitutes
**				"Access Rule violation"), status of E_DB_ERROR 
**				will be returned which will cause the 
**				CREATE SCHEMA statement to be rolled back
** Output:
**     
**     privs_to_find		0 if user posesses all required
**     				privileges; map of privileges which the 
**				user does not posess otherwise
**     fully_satisfied          map of privileges which were fully satisfied;
**				this is only relevant when we are processing 
**				GRANT ALL and want to find out which privileges 
**				were fully satisfied (privileges such as UPDATE
**				and soon - INSERT and REFERENCES could
**				be partially satisfied)
**     err_blk			filled in if an error occurs
**
** Side effects:
**     causes IIPROTECT to be opened, reads tuples, and closes it
** 
** Returns:
**	E_DB_{OK,ERROR}
**
** History:
**
**	04-jul-92 (andre)	
**	    written
**	15-jul-92 (andre)
**	    added grant_all to the interface
**	14-aug-92 (andre)
**	    added fully_satisfied to the interface
**
**	    if while processing GRANT ALL it turns out that a privilege such as
**	    UPDATE was only partially satisfied, we will store a map of
**	    attributes on which a user possesses UPDATE WGO in the
**	    indep_col_specific_privs and set DB_REPLACE in
**	    indep_col_specific_privs->psy_col_privs
**	29-sep-92 (andre)
**	    RDF may choose to allocate a new info block and return its address
**	    in rdf_info_blk - we need to copy it over to pss_rdrinfo to avoid
**	    memory leak and other assorted unpleasantries
**	08-dec-92 (andre)
**	    made changes associated with adding support for REFERENCES privilege
**	10-Feb-93 (Teresa)
**	    Changed RDF_GETINFO to RDF_READTUPLES for new RDF I/F
**	18-mar-93 (rblumer)
**	    Changed grant_all parameter into a flags field,
**	    and added no-grant-option flag & no-error flag.
**	02-nov-93 (andre)
**	    if the user attempting to grant a privilege on object X possesses 
**	    no privileges whatsoever on X, rather than issuing a message saying
**	    that he cannot grant some privilege(s) on X, we will issue a message
**	    saying that EITHER X does not exist OR the user may not access it.
**	03-nov-93 (andre)
**	    a new bit - PSY_GRANT_ISSUED_IN_CRT_SCHEMA - may be set in flags to
**	    notify us that the GRANT statement was issued inside CREATE SCHEMA 
**	    in which case if a user possesses no privileges whatsoever on the 
**	    object named in CREATE SCHEMA statement, in addition to issuing the
**	    E_US088E error message, we will return a status of E_DB_ERROR which
**	    will lead to rollback of CREATE SCHEMA statement (which is what 
**	    should happen since, according to SQL92, this constitutes an 
**	    "Access Rule violation".
**	11-oct-93 (swm)
**	    Bug #56448
**	    Declared trbuf for psf_display() to pass to TRformat.
**	    TRformat removes `\n' chars, so to ensure that psf_scctrace()
**	    outputs a logical line (which it is supposed to do), we allocate
**	    a buffer with one extra char for NL and will hide it from TRformat
**	    by specifying length of 1 byte less. The NL char will be inserted
**	    at the end of the message by psf_scctrace().
**	11-feb-94 (swm)
**	    Bug #59614
**	    My previous integration (bug #56448) erroneously introduced a
**	    block of code during integrate merging. This had the side-effect
**	    of failing the WGO runall test because US088E is issued instead
**	    of PS055[12] when a user specifies some privileges which they
**	    may not grant.

/*
** Name:	psy_pr_cs_privs	- print description of a column-specific 
**				  privilege
**
** Description:
**	Given a privilege, a bit map of attributes to which a privilege applies
**	(or does not apply), and a list of attribute descriptors, this function 
**	will generate text describing the column specific privilege
**
** Input:
**	priv			privilege type (one of DB_APPEND, DB_REPLACE, or
**				DB_REFERENCES)
**	col_priv_attmap		map describing to which attributes a privilege 
**				denoted by priv must (or must not apply)
**	att_list		address of a list of attribute descriptors
**
** Output:
**	none
**
** Side effects:
**	none
**
** Returns:
**	none
**
** History:
**	09-dec-92 (andre)
**	    written
**	11-oct-93 (swm)
**	    Bug #56448
**	    Declared trbuf for psf_display() to pass to TRformat.
**	    TRformat removes `\n' chars, so to ensure that psf_scctrace()
**	    outputs a logical line (which it is supposed to do), we allocate
**	    a buffer with one extra char for NL and will hide it from TRformat
**	    by specifying length of 1 byte less. The NL char will be inserted
**	    at the end of the message by psf_scctrace().
