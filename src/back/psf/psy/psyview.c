/**
**
**  Name: PSYVIEW.C - View processing functions
**
**  Description:
**	This module does the view processing.  Basically, it operates
**	by detecting all references to views and replacing them by
**	references to real relations.  There are a number of cases
**	when it cannot do this, to whit:
**
**	Syntactic problems:  the view may have a domain defined as
**	a non-simple value (that is, not a simple attribute), which
**	is then required to take on a value.  For example, if the
**	view is defined as
**		range of x is baserel
**		define v (d = x.a / 3)
**	and then referenced as
**		append to v (d = 7)
**	would result after query modification as
**		range of x is baserel
**		append to baserel (a / 3 = 7)
**	which is not acceptable.  Of course, there is a range of cases
**	where this can be fixed, but (for the time being) we will just
**	throw them all out.
**
**	Disappearing tuple anomaly:  the implicit qualification on
**	a view allows tuples to disappear even when not a duplicate.
**	For example, take a view defined as:
**		range of x is baserel
**		define v (d = x.a) where x.a = 4
**	and issue the query
**		append to v (d = 5)
**	The tuple will be inserted into the base relation, but will not
**	be included in the view.  To solve that problem, we disallow
**	updates to domains included in the qualification of the query.
**	Note that this includes implicit updates, that is, an append
**	with the domain missing (which implicitly appends a zero or
**	blank domain).
**
**	Cross product problem:  a view which is defined as a cross
**	product of two relations has several update anomalies.  For
**	example, take R1 and R2 as:
**              R1 | a | b      R2 | b | c
**              ---|---|---     ---|---|---
**                 | 7 | 0         | 0 | 3
**                 | 8 | 0         | 0 | 4
**	and issue the view definition
**		range of m is R1
**		range of n is R2
**		define v (m.a, m.b, n.c) where m.b = n.b
**	which will define a view which looks like
**              view | a | b | c
**              -----|---|---|---
**                   | 7 | 0 | 3
**                   | 7 | 0 | 4
**                   | 8 | 0 | 3
**                   | 8 | 0 | 4
**	Now try issuing
**		range of v is v
**		delete v where v.a = 8 and v.c = 4
**	which will try to give a view which looks like:
**              view | a | b | c
**              -----|---|---|---
**                   | 7 | 0 | 3
**                   | 7 | 0 | 4
**                   | 8 | 0 | 3
**	which is of course unexpressible in R1 and R2.
**
**	Multiple query problem:  certain updates will require gener-
**	ating multiple queries to satisfy the update on the view.
**	Although this can be made to work, it won't now.  Cases are
**	replaces where the target list contains more than one
**	relation, and appends to a view over more than one relation.
**
**	To solve these problems, we dissallow the following cases:
**
**	I.  In a REPLACE or APPEND statement, if a 'v.d' appears
**		on the LHS in the target list of the query and
**		the a-fcn for 'v.d' is not a simple attribute.
**	II.  In REPLACE or APPEND statements, if a 'v.d' appears
**		on the LHS in a target list of the query and in
**		the qualification of the view.
**	III.  In a DELETE or APPEND statement, if the view ranges
**		over more than one relation.
**
** III above should include REPLACE, I think (vrscan already checks this
** anyhow). I do not understand what IV is for.  It makes the query
** replace tmp(att=someview.att) illegal. So we will take IV out.
**
**	IV.  In a REPLACE statement, if the query resulting after
**		modification of the tree, but before appending the
**		view qualification Qv, has more than one variable.
**	NOTE: RESTRICTION NUMBER IV HAS BEEN REMOVED.
**	V.  In any update, if an aggregate or aggregate function
**		appears anywhere in the target list of the view.
**
**	Note the assumption that the definition of a consistent update
**	is:
**		"An update is consistent if the result of
**		 performing the update on the view and then
**		 materializing that view is the same as the
**		 result of materializing the view and then
**		 performing the update."

**	29-oct-87 (stec)
**	    Fix bit maps by executing psy_fixmap; add psy_fixmap.
**	11-may-88 (stec)
**	    Modify for db procs.
**	22-july-88 (andre)
**	    reset emode to PSQ_RETRIEVE for non-target range vars in
**          DELETE/INSERT/UPDATE staatements
**	30-aug-88 (stec)
**	    Translate E_PS903 into user class error.
**	31-aug-88 (stec)
**	    The fix above had a bug.
**	06-sep-88 (stec)
**	    Change view_rngvar to view_rgvar (lint).
**	    Call psy_subsvars with view_rgvar and not its address.
**	07-oct-88 (stec)
**	    Fix bugs resulting in wrong number of rows returned.
**	04-nov-88 (stec)
**	    Fix processing for case where cb->pss_resrng turns out
**	    to represent no real variables.
**	23-nov-88 (stec)
**	    Change psy_vrscan to modify pst_ntargno.
**	05-apr-89 (andre)
**	    Since psy_subsvars() now takes care of ALL maps, we remove the call
**	    to psy_fixmap() as well as the procedure itself.  As it were,
**	    psy_fixmap() was called with a wrong parameter.  It was supposed to
**	    be called with pst_tvrm of the root node of the view tree so that
**	    every reference to the view would be replaced with references to the
**	    tables used in the definition of the view (from_list only);
**	    however, passing viewmask resluted in every reference to the view
**	    being replaced with reference to ALL tables used in definition of
**	    the view (even the tables being used in the qualification of the
**	    view.)
**	16-aug-89 (nancy)
**	    Fix bug #7461 where error results if result var for append is view
**	    and target of subselect is also a view.  Since emode is reset,
**	    use query_mode when checking for special result range var.
**	14-sep-90 (teresa)
**	    the following booleans have changed to bit flags: PSS_AGINTREE and 
**	    PSS_CATUPD
**	20-jan-92 (andre)
**	    defined psy_add_indep_obj()
**	4-may-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Added support for PSQ_DGTT_AS_SELECT for temporary tables.
**	3-apr-93 (markg)
**	    Moved the doaudit() routine from psypermit.c to this file and
**	    modifed psy_view() to call doaudit() while unravelling view
**	    definitions in the range table. This means that in C2 servers 
**	    the auditing data structures are built as each view is unravelled,
**	    and will now contain the correct data.
**	14-jul-93 (ed)
**	    replacing <dbms.h> by <gl.h> <sl.h> <iicommon.h> <dbdbms.h>
**	10-sep-93 (tam)
**	    In star, if local schema of the underlying tables has changed, as 
**	    detected by pst_showtab, change psy_view() to report error (b54663).
**      16-sep-93 (smc)
**          Added/moved <cs.h> for CS_SID. Added history_template so we
**          can automate this next time.
**	21-oct-93 (andre)
**	    added obj_type to psy_add_indep_obj() interface since this function
** 	    will now also be used to accumulate ids of synonyms used in dbproc's
** 	    definition
**	21-oct-93 (stephenb)
**	    INSERT statement is not being audited, altered code so that a range
**	    table will be built for this instance.
**	16-nov-93 (stephenb)
**	    Altered routines so that UPDATE WHERE CURRENT OF CURSOR is audited.
**	2-dec-93 (robf)
**          Renamed doaudit() to psy_build_audit_info()
**	1-feb-94 (stephenb)
**	    Backed out INSERT fixes for 21-oct, and made 16-nov fix for
**	    update cursor more efficient.
**      31-jul-97 (stial01)
**          psy_view() Copy vtree->pst_rangetab[rgno]->pst_rngvar to pass
**          to pst_rgrent(). RDF_UNFIX in pst_rgrent frees this memory.
**	10-Jan-2001 (jenjo02)
**	    Added *PSS_SELBLK parm to psf_mopen(), psf_mlock(), psf_munlock(),
**	    psf_malloc(), psf_mclose(), psf_mroot(), psf_mchtyp(),
**	    pst_treedup().
**	06-Jul-06 (kiria01) b116230
**	    psl_print becomes PSL_RS_PRINT bit in new field psl_rsflags
**	    to allow for extra flags in PST_RSDM_NODE
**	13-May-2009 (kschendel) b122041

/*{
** Name: psy_view	- Driver for view processing
**
** Description:
**	This routine does the view processing portion of qrymod.
**	Since the 'tree' catalog can contain relations which are
**	themselves views, it iterates over itself until no views
**	are found.  Presumably this cannot result in an infinite
**	loop.
**
**	For each range variable declared, it is checked whether
**	that variable is a view.  If not, it is ignored.
**	Then the tree which defines
**	this view is fetched from the "tree" catalog by psy_gettree().
**	which also defines any variables required by this tree
**	and adjusts the tree so that the varno's contained in the
**	tree correspond to the varno's in the range table.
**
**	'psy_subsvars' and 'psy_vrscan' really do it.  Given the root of the
**	tree to be modified, the variable number to be eliminated, and the
**	target list for a replacement tree, they actually do the
**	tacking of 'new tree' onto 'old tree'.  After it is done,
**	there should be no references to the old variable at all
**	in the tree.
**	'psy_vrscan' scans the left hand branch of the tree (the RESDOM
**	nodes) and substitutes them.
**	'psy_subsvars' scans for VAR nodes (which are
**	retrieve-only, and hence are always alright);
**	it also determines which root nodes (ROOTs and AGHEADs)
**	to which the view qualification will have to be appended;
**	psy_subsvars calls 'psy_apql' to actually append the view
**	qualification (if any) where appropriate.  Finally, the variable for
**	the view (which had all references to it eliminated by 'subsvars') is
**	un-defined, so that that slot in the range table can be re-
**	used by later scans.
**
** Inputs:
**	mstream				psf memory stream control block
**      root                            root node of query tree
**	rngtab				The range table
**	qmode				query mode --  Valid expected modes are:
** 					    PSQ_RETRIEVE, PSQ_RETINTO, 
**					    PSQ_APPEND, PSQ_DELETE, PSQ_REPLACE,
**					    PSQ_DEFCURS, PSQ_VIEW, PSQ_RULE, and
**					    PSQ_DGTT_AS_SELECT.
** 					All other modes cause silent return 
**					(no error)
**	sess_cb				PSF session control block
**	num_joins			Ptr to a var containing number of joins
**					found in the tree so far
**	resp_mask			pointer to a preinitiaslized (0L) mask
**					which may be populated with useful info
**					discovered by psy_view()
**	
** Outputs:
**      root                            Can be modified by view definition
**	err_blk				Filled in if an error happened
**	*num_joins			Will be incremented by the number of
**					joins found in the views referenced
**					by the query
**	*resp_mask			may contain useful information for the
**					caller
**	Returns:
**	    E_DB_OK			Success
**	    E_DB_ERROR			Failure
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	    The range table is updated to delete any views and add any base
**	    relations needed to support them.
**	    Catalog I/O to get query trees.
**
** History:
**	19-jun-86 (jeff)
**          written
**	1-oct-86 (daved)
**	    modified to handle special result range var the way all range
**	    vars are handled. Reduce code space by combining two almost
**	    identical sections. Fix what appear to be certain bugs related
**	    to special result range vars and other potential bugs found while
**	    reading the code.
**	9-oct-86 (daved)
**	    don't request qrytext information when processing the view from
**	    RDF.
**	19-feb-87 (daved)
**	    save result range var copy for error handling in psy_vrscan
**	2-apr-87 (daved)
**	    set a pss_permit flag in the range table for each used entry.
**	    psy_permit will clear this flag. Psy_view will set this flag
**	    in all range entries that are derived from a table that still has
**	    this flag set, else it will clear this flag for new entries.
**	    We will then call psy_permit again, to catch all the new entries.
**	27-aug-87 (stec)
**	    Remember if PSQ_DEFCURS mode for psy_vrscan.
**	30-dec-87 (stec)
**	    Validate mode with a switch statement rather than an if stmnt.
**	    Change code to reflect  changes in psy_vcount i/f.
**	    Define and use PST_VRMAP variable rather than a i4  for
**	    variable bitmap operations. 
**	11-may-88 (stec)
**	    Modify for db procs.
**	22-july-88 (andre)
**	    Reset emode to PSQ_RETRIEVE for non-target range vars in
**          DELETE/INSERT/UPDATE staatements.  This is necessary because
**	    we should not insist that a view which appears in a subselect
**	    of a DELETE/UPDATE/INSERT statement is updatable.
**	03-aug-88 (andre)
**	    Instead of checking value of emode (which may have been reset to
**	    PSQ_RETRIEVE while processing the previous view), the above fix
**	    must involve checking query_mode, which would contain a true
**	    query mode.
**	30-aug-88 (stec)
**	    Translate E_PS903 into user class error on pst_rgent call to fix
**	    2644.
**	31-aug-88 (stec)
**	    The fix above had a bug.
**	06-sep-88 (stec)
**	    Change view_rngvar to view_rgvar (lint).
**	    Call psy_subsvars with view_rgvar and not its address.
**	03-sep-88 (andre)
**	    Modify call to pst_rgent and pst_rgrent to pass 0 as a query mode
**	    since it is clearly not PSQ_DESTROY.
**	23-may-89 (andre)
**	        Consider the following situation:DBA owns table T and a view V
**	    defined on it.  DBA grants user Andre retrieve eprmit on V, but not
**	    T.  Under present model, psy_protect() is called by psy_qrymod()
**	    twice: before psy_view() and after psy_integ().
**	        We will modify this model as follows:  check_perms will be
**	    used to indicate if there are any entries in the range table which
**	    must be presented to psy_protect() before we try to qrymod them.
**	    check_perms will be set to FALSE in the beginning of each scan
**	    through the range table.
**	        Every potential candidate for qrymod will be checked to make
**	    sure that it doesn't have to be presented to psy_protect() first;
**	    if so, qrymod will be aplied to it during the next scan.
**	        At the end of the scan, if check_perms is TRUE, psy_protect()
**	    will be invoked.
**	30-may-89 (andre)
**	    until now, psy_view was given both ptr to the root of the tree
**	    (root) and address of the ptr to the root of the query tree
**	    (result).  At the end, if everything went OK, *result was set to r.
**	    Unfortunately, depending on whether or not the last view considered
**	    by psy_view() was a parent of a non-mergeable view, r could be
**	    pointing to the tree representing the non-mergeable view, rather
**	    than the query tree.  As a result of this, psy_integ() and
**	    psy_permit() would be modifying a wrong tree (consider the following
**	    example: create table t1 (i i);
**	             create view vv1 as select * from t1;
**		     create view v1 as select distinct * from vv1;
**		     insert into t1 values (5);
**		     create integrity on t1 is i>0;
**		     update t1 set i=-1; * (0 rows) *
**		     update t1 from v1 set i=-1; * (1 rows) *
**	    ) The reason for this is that psy_integ() would apply qualification
**	    (i>0) to the tree fro v1 as opposed to the query tree.
**	    The solution was to remove assignment to *result, and, since that
**	    was the only place where result was referenced, to not pass address
**	    of the ptr to the root as an argument to psy_view().
**	02-jun-89 (andre)
**	    Use pst_dup_viewtree() to duplicate view tree + check for AGHEAD
**	    nodes with BYHEAD for a left child.  If such combination is found in
**	    the outermost SELECT of the view definition, view will be considered
**	    non-mergeable.
**	16-jun-89 (andre)
**	    Rather than call psy_sqlview(), use the info that we obtain anyway
**	    to tell if this is a SQL view.
**	16-aug-89 (nancy)
**	    Fix bug #7461 where error results if result var for append is view
**	    and target of subselect is also a view.  Since emode is reset,
**	    use query_mode when checking for special result range var.
**	08-sep-89 (andre)
**	    Accept ptr to a var containign number of joins found in the query so
**	    far.  If we find a view which involves joins, we need to increment
**	    group_id field in all operator nodes which have a valid group_id by
**	    the number of joins found so far.  We will also need to reset
**	    outer_rel masks in the range table entry(ies) for the table(s) used
**	    in the definition of the view.
**	13-sep-89 (andre)
**	    Since pst_dup_viewtree() has been collapsed into all new and
**	    improved pst_treedup(), we will be using pst_treedup() again.
**	    Note: pst_treedup()'s interface has changed.
**	09-nov-89 (andre)
**	    Multivariable view will be treated as unmergeable.  This is done to
**	    fix bug 8160.  OPF will handle it better, and the
**	    "duplicate semantics" will not be lost.
**	02-feb-90 (andre)
**	    ALL distinct views will be deemed unmergeable.  Until now distinct
**	    views woould be declared unmergeable if they were used in a
**	    non-distinct query.  This is done to fix bug 9520.
**	    Views involved in outer join will be marked as unmergeable.
**	12-mar-90 (andre)
**	    set rdr_2types_mask to 0.
**      22-may-90 (teg)
**          init rdr_instr to RDF_NO_INSTR
**	12-sep-90 (andre)
**	    as a part of fix for bug# (forgot the number), we will declare 
**	    array of pointers to structures used to collect additional 
**    	    info about views.  To avoid fetching view tree more than 
**	    once for the sole purpose of determining if the view is an 
**	    SQL view , new structure will include a bit which will allow 
**	    us to save this info.  The primary reason for this change, 
**	    however, is to fix bug (forgot the number):
**		for non-mergerable view V s.t. for relations R1, R2, ... Rn used
**		in definition of V we need to check if the current user may
**		access them, we will build a map of the attributes of the
**		view which are used in the main query; this info will be used by
**		psy_protect().
**	    NOTE: as a result of one of the changes introduced with this fix,
**	    caller of psy_view() has no reason to call psy_protect() after
**	    psy_view(), since psy_view() will call psy_protect() if there are
**	    any tables (not just views) whose permissions need to be checked.
**	14-sep-90 (teresa)
**	    the following booleans have changed to bit flags: PSS_AGINTREE and 
**	    PSS_CATUPD
**	19-mar-91 (andre)
**	    pst_rgrent() unfixes the RDF cache entry, so, once we have replaced
**	    the description of the result view with that of the relation on
**	    which it is defined, we may not access the view tree.  Therefore
**	    we need to save all information from the view tree which
**	    [information, that is] we need after calling pst_rgrent().  To
**	    reduce the amount of information which must be saved, we will
**	    replace the description of the result view with that of the relation
**	    on which it was defined after we have entered into PSF range table
**	    description of all other relations used in the definition of the
**	    view.
**	07-aug-91 (andre)
**	    psy_view() can be called by psy_dview() (via psy_qrymod()) to
**	    ascertain that the new view is not abandoned.  psy_qrymod() used to
**	    translate PSQ_VIEW into PSQ_RETRIEVE before calling psy_view(), but
**	    now psy_view() may be expected to perform special actions if the
**	    tree is that of a view, so the translation will no longer take
**	    place, i.e. psy_view() will now "know" how to deal when qmode is set
**	    to PSQ_VIEW
**
**	    Added resp_mask to the argument list.  This new field will be used
**	    to communicate all sorts of useful info to the caller of the
**	    function.  Initially, it will be used when the function is called in
**	    the course of processing CREATE/DEFINE VIEW to notify caller whether
**	    the view is grantable and/or updateable.
**	08-aug-91 (andre)
**	    if psy_view() was called to determine if the view being created is
**	    abandoned, and the view definition is updateable (as far as we can
**	    tell from the definition alone), sess_cb->pss_resrng will point at
**	    the relation in the outermost subselect of the view definition
**	11-sep-91 (andre)
**	    If processing CREATE/DEFINE VIEW, build a list of independent
**	    objects; this list will consist of tables and views owned by the
**	    current user and QUEL views owned by other users which appear in the
**	    definition of the view
**
**	    A user is guaranteed to be able to retrieve data from tables and
**	    views owned by him (I am sort of jumping the gun since we do not
**	    enforce destruction of abandoned objects, YET), so when processing
**	    CREATE/DEFINE VIEW we can avoid expanding views owned by the current
**	    user.  Furthermore, once it is established that a user can access a
**	    given view, we do not need to expand it any further since the
**	    purpose of calling psy_view() when creating a new view is to
**	    establish that a user can select data from it.
**	12-sep-91 (andre)
**	    (RE: 07-aug-91 and 08-aug-91 (andre))
**	    psy_view() will not be responsible for determining if a view is
**	    updateable.  We decided that we should not be recording if a view is
**	    updateable since the criteria for determining it may change and
**	    recording it now would result in a big conversion effort later.
**	24-sep-91 (andre)
**	    If processing CREATE PROCEDURE, build a list of independent
**	    objects; this list will consist of tables and views owned by the
**	    current user and QUEL views owned by other users which appear in the
**	    definition of the procedure; note that unlike CREATE/DEFINE VIEW
**	    case, we will not assume that views owned by the current user can be
**	    accesed in the prescribed manner (i.e. we will not reset pss_permit
**	    for that range variable.)
**	30-sep-91 (andre)
**	    use sess_cb->pss_dependencies_stream to allocate elements of the
**	    independent object lists
**	04-oct-91 (andre)
**	    when building the list of independent objects in the course of
**	    parsing a dbproc, look for duplicates only in the current sublist
**	    (i.e. until hit a PSQ_DBPLIST_HEADER or a PSQ_INFOLIST_HEADER or
**	    NULL)
**	17-oct-91 (andre)
**	    if processing CREATE/DEFINE VIEW we will avoid expanding views owned
**	    by the current user, however, before deciding to ignore such views,
**	    we must check their grantability status as it may affect
**	    grantability of the view being created.
**	11-nov-91 (rblumer)
**	  merged from 6.4:  26-feb-91 (andre)
**	    PST_QTREE was changed to store the range table as an array of
**	    pointers to PST_RNGENTRY structure.
**	20-jan-92 (andre)
**	    defined a new function - psy_add_indep_obj();  it will be
**	    responsible for checking if a given object needs to be inserted into
**	    an independent object list;
**
**	    while at it, I fixed a (maybe not so minor) bug: when processing
**	    dbprocs, new id could have been added to a wrong list which implied
**	    that we could/would be trashing memory
**	18-mar-92 (andre)
**	    forgot to copy join maps from view tree range entry to the new range
**	    table entry when unraveling view definitions.
**	4-may-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Added support for PSQ_DGTT_AS_SELECT for temporary tables.
**	02-jun-92 (andre)
**	    Until now if in the course of processing CREATE/DEFINE VIEW we came
**	    across a view owned by the current user, we would automatically
**	    decide to not expand it further being satisfied that the view being
**	    created/defined will not be abandoned since the underlying view
**	    would only exist if it were not abandoned.
**	    
**	    Unfortunately, this assumption introduced one real problem + it has
**	    a potential to complicate processing of certain cases of REVOKE
**	    GRANT OPTION FOR SELECT on some of the view's underlying tables
**	    owned by other users and GRANT SELECT on the view itself:
**	    
**          consider the following scenario:
**
**		U1: create T (i=i)
**		    define permit retrieve on T(i) to U2
**		U2: define view QV (T.all)
**		    create view SV as select * from QV
**		    
**	      - SV above would be created even though it is abandoned (i.e. its
**	        owner would not be able to select from it); this is possible
**		because the privileges required to select from the new view will
**		constitute a proper superset of those required to retrieve from
**		the underlying QUEL view;
**	      - when processing REVOKE GRANT OPTION FOR SELECT ON U1.T from U2,
**	        we would be forced to repeatedly scan IIDBDEPENDS to find all
**		SQL views owned by U2 which depend on SELECT privilege on U1.T
**		on which SELECT PRIVILEGE may have been granted
**	      - when processing GRANT SELECT ON U2.SV we would have to unravel
**	        the entire view tree (for privileges other than SELECT we need
**		to unravel only view trees associated with underlying views as
**		opposed to all views involved in the view's <query expression>)
**
**	    Consequently, I am going to change the algorithm as follows:
**
**	      - if in the course of processing DEFINE VIEW we encounter an
**	        object (table or view) owned by the current user, we will not
**		process this object any further; this will not cause problems
**		described above because privileges required for a new QUEL view
**		to not be abandoned are guaranteed to be a subset of those
**		required for its underlying (QUEL or SQL) views to not be
**		abandoned and one may not grant privileges on QUEL views;
**	      - if in the course of processing CREATE VIEW we encounter a table
**	        or an always-grantable view owned by the current user, we will
**		not process this object any further; this will not cause
**		problems because no one can revoke current user's privileges on
**		that table or view
**	15-jun-92 (barbara)
**	    For Sybil change interface to pst_rgent and pst_rgrent.  Set
**	    rdr_r1_distrib.
**	29-sep-92 (andre)
**	    RDF may choose to allocate a new info block and return its address
**	    in rdf_info_blk - we need to copy it over to pss_rdrinfo to avoid
**	    memory leak and other assorted unpleasantries
**	30-sep-92 (andre)
**	    pst_treedup() will return PSS_GROUP_BY_IN_TREE instead of
**	    PST_3GROUP_BY in dup_rb.pss_tree_info if the outermost subselect
**	    immediately contained an AGGHEAD with a BYHEAD for a left child
**
**	    if a view tree contained a singleton subselect, pst_treedup() would
**	    set PSS_SINGLETON_SUBSEL_IN_TREE in dup_rb.pss_tree_info in which
**	    case we will set PSS_SINGLETON_SUBSELECT in sess_cb->pss_stmt_flags
**	25-nov-92 (andre)
**	    psy_view() will do some special processing when handling trees for
**	    SQL views being defined WITH CHECK OPTION (HINT: this processing
**	    will be similar to processing for rules defined on views when/if we
**	    get around to supporing them.)  In particular, if an underlying view
**	    of the new view is not updatable, we will specify the reason using
**	    resp_mask and return error.
**
**	    Another change that was made in passing but will probably have a
**	    more significant impact is that rather than relying on pst_agintree
**	    as an indication that a view is not updatable, we will instruct
**	    pst_treedup() to look for aggregates in the target list of the view
**	    whose tree is being copied, and only if one is found, will we claim
**	    that a view is not updatable
**	29-dec-92 (andre)
**	    (this overrides the last sentense of the first paragraph under
**	     25-nov-92 (andre))
**	     
**	    if processing a view definition and we were asked to determine
**	    whether WITH CHECK OPTION may be specified for the view and it turns
**	    out that the view is not updatable, continue processing and return
**	    an indicator of why the view is not updatable to the caller.  Rather
**	    than treating it as an error, we will return a warning to the user
**	    and proceed to create a view WITHOUT CHECK OPTION
**	30-dec-92 (andre)
**	    pst_treedup() will not have to look for aggregates in the gtarget
**	    list of the outermost subselect of the view's definition.  Instead
**	    this information will be available inside PST_QTREE.pst_mask1
**
**	    psy_view() will learn to process a view tree as a part of
**	    CREATE RULE ON view processing
**	31-dec-92 (andre)
**	    we will no longer expect pst_treedup() to look for singleton
**	    subselects inside view trees.  Instead, if a view involved a
**	    singleton subselect, PST_SINGLETON_SUBSEL will be set inside
**	    pst_mask1 of the view tree header
**	04-jan-93 (andre)
**	    if a view which is a target of DELETE, INSERT, or UPDATE has rules
**	    defined on it, check if any of them apply before unravelling the
**	    view
**
**	    if a table which is a target of DELETE, INSERT, or UPDATE has rules
**	    defined on it, check if any of them apply before leaving the
**	    function
**	11-feb-93 (andre)
**	    if a query contained a reference(s) to TID of a base table T through
**	    a view V, V must be updatable; if not, user will be treated to an
**	    error message
**	31-mar-93 (andre)
**	    fix for bugs 50823 & 50825
**
**	    Briefly, these bugs were caused by the fact that
**	    UPDATE WHERE CURRENT OF were not going through qrymod a consequence
**	    of which was that
**		1) references to view's columns were not translated into
**		   references to the columns of the underlying base table which
**		   meant that RESDOM numbers were not changed and wrong columns
**		   were updated, and
**		2) rules defined on base tables were never attached to the query
**		   tree
**		   
**	    To fix this, we will implement the following changes:
**
**	      - during processing of DEFINE/DECLARE CURSOR, psy_view() will
**	        build PSC_TBL_DESCR structure for every view or table over which
**		the cursor is defined; these elements will be used to build
**		lists of rules pertaining to each of the cursor's underlying
**		table/views
**
**	      - psy_view() will NOT ALWAYS return E_DB_OK upon being
**	        presented with PSQ_REPCURS
**		
**	      - if (qmode == PSQ_REPCURS)
**		{
**		  if (   cursor was defined in SQL
**		      || at DECLARE CURSOR time we determined that the user
**		         possesses unconditional RETRIEVE privilege on every
**			 attribute of the table or view over which the QUEL
**			 cursor is defined
**		     )
**		  {
**		    if (   cursor was defined over a view
**			or some rules were defined over the table/view over
**			   which the cursor was defined)
**		    {
**		      we need to unravel the view referenced in the UPDATE
**		      statement, but we should skip permit checking since it was
**		      done at DECLARE CURSOR time; we may also have to invoke
**		      psy_rules() to establish whether any rules defined on the
**		      cursor's underlying table/views apply to this query
**		    }
**		    else
**		    {
**		      skip qrymod - there are no views to unravel, privileges to
**		      check, or rules to attach
**		    }
**		  }
**		  else
**		  {
**		    // cursor was defined in QUEL over another user's table,
**		    // and at DECLARE CURSOR time we were unable to verify that
**		    // the user possesses unconditional RETRIEVE on every
**		    // column of the table or view on which this cursor was
**		    // defined
**		    go through the usual algorithm - psy_protect() will
**		    verify that the user may RETRIEVE columns which appear on
**		    the RHS of assignment; psy_rules() will determine whether
**		    any rules defined on the cursor's underlying table/views
**		    apply to this query
**		  }
**		}
**
**	      - having obtained a view tree, we will immediately get rid of the
**		view's qualification since we are not at all interested in
**		dealing with it and any range variables that may be found in it
**
**	    NOTE: bug 50825 also applies to DELETE CURSOR.  However, because
**		  with DELETE CURSOR there is no need to translate references to
**		  view attributes, the fix will be made in psq_dlcsrrow()
**	12-apr-93 (andre)
**	    do NOT add elements to the independent object list if parsing a
**	    system-generated dbproc.  System-generated dbprocs are created to
**	    enforce constraints or CHECK OPTION and QEF will record their
**	    dependence on a constraint or a view, respectively
**	31-mar-93 (andre)
**	    (PSF part of fix for bug 49513)
**	    Sometime ago we changed things to avoid merging multi-variable views
**	    into the query tree.  Now we go one step further, and stop merging
**	    into the query tree 0-variable (i.e. constant) views
**	3-apr-93 (markg)
**	    Moodified this routine to call doaudit() for range table
**	    entries as views are being unravelled in C2 servers.
**	19-may-93 (andre)
**	    when unravelling a view, contents of parent's rngvar->pss_var_mask
**	    should not be automatically passed on to the child's
**	    rngvar->pss_var_mask.
**	    In particular, it makes little sense to copy PSS_EXPLICIT_QUAL and
**	    PSS_EXPLICIT_CORR_NAME.
**	    PSS_RULE_RNG_VAR and PSS_TID_REFERENCE should only be copied if the
**	    child is the parents underlying table/view. This means that only
**	    PSS_IN_INDEP_OBJ_LIST should be copied from the parent's
**	    rngvar->pss_var_mask to that of all of its children.
**	10-aug-93 (andre)
**	    fixed a cause of a compiler warning
**	14-aug-93 (andre)
**	    move code block incorrectly placed in the middle of existing 
**	    IF...ELSE
**
**	    in addition to recording ids of QUEL views owned by other users
**	    when processing definitions of views and dbprocs, we must also
**	    record ids of indices owned by other users which are directly 
**	    referenced in the view definition; this will ensure that destruction
**	    of the index will result in destruction of the view or in dbproc
**	    being marked dormant
**	20-aug-93 (andre)
**	    When processing definition of a view, we need to remember id of some
**	    base table (other than a core catalog) used in its definition.  It
**	    will be used to ensure that if the view is destroyed, QEPs for 
**	    queries and dbprocs involving this view are invalidated.  
**	    
**	    The underlying base table id (ubt_id) for the new view V will be 
**	    determined as follows:
**		- during regular qrymod processing when considering 
**		  some object X:
**		  if (    ubt_id has not yet been determined
**		      and X is a table or index
**		      and X is NOT a core catalog)
**		  {
**		      set V's ubt_id to id of X
**		  }
**		- during regular qrymod processing, upon retrieving query tree
**		  for view X
**		  if (    ubt_id has not yet been determined
**		      and underlying base table id has been determined when X 
**	   	          was first created)
**		  {
**		      set V's ubt_id to ubt_id of X
**		  }
**		- if ubt_id could not be determined during the regular qrymod
**		  processing then we will scan the range table one last time
**		  looking for an entry describing a view whose ubt_id has 
**		  been determined when it was created; if such view V1 is found,
**		  V's ubt_id will be set to that of V1
**	01-sep-93 (andre)
**	    if we are parsing a dbproc definition, and 
**	    sess_cb->pss_dbp_ubt_id.db_tab_base is 0, we are still looking for
**	    an id of a base table on which a dbproc being parsed depends, so we
**	    will set ubt_id to &sess_cb->pss_dbp_ubt_id and utilize code 
**	    previously added for determining ubt_id of a view to determine 
**	    ubt_id of a dbproc
**	10-sep-93 (tam)
**	    In star, if local schema of the underlying tables has changed,
**	    as detected by pst_showtab, report error (b54663).
**	21-oct-93 (andre)
**	    When processing definition of a dbproc, we need to store ids of 
**	    synonyms used in the dbproc definition
**	21-oct-93 (stephenb)
**	    Make sure we set build_audit TRUE even though rngtab->pss_rgno = -1
**	    because we need to audit INSERT.
**	15-nov-93 (andre)
**	    PSS_SINGLETON_SUBSELECT got moved from pss_stmt_flags to
**	    pss_flattening_flags
**	16-nov-93 (andre)
**	    Avoid recording id of any catalog (although we absolutely need to 
**	    do it for S_CONCUR catalogs and IIPROTECT, IIPROCEDURE, IISYNONYM, 
**	    IICOMMENT, and IIRULE) catalogs as the UBT_ID.  This is done in 
**	    order to avoid a situation where we alter a timestamp of a catalog 
**	    (which causes it to be opened in exclusive mode) and later try to 
**	    update that catalog which results in an unfriendly message from DMF.
**	    I feel that the number of cases where we would fail to force 
**	    invalidation of timestamps as a result of these change will be very
**	    small whereas having to deal with an irate customer unable to 
**	    destroy his object or privilege can be much more traumatic
**	16-nov-93 (stephenb)
**	    Altered so that we do continue on PSQ_REPCURS, because we need to
**	    audit this.
**	17-nov-93 (andre)
**	    if PST_CORR_AGGR/PST_SUBSEL_IN_OR_TREE/PST_ALL_IN_TREE/
**	    PST_MULT_CORR_ATTRS bits are set in vtree->pst_mask1, set
**	    PSS_CORR_AGGR/PSS_SUBSEL_IN_OR_TREE/PSS_ALL_IN_TREE/
**	    PSS_MULT_CORR_ATTRS in sess_cb->pss_flattening_flags
**	1-feb-94 (stephenb)
**	    Backed out INSERT fixes for 21-oct, and made 16-nov fix for

**	23-may-97 (inkdo01)
**	    Don't use global temp tables for UBT of dbproc.
**      31-jul-97 (stial01)
**          psy_view() Copy vtree->pst_rangetab[rgno]->pst_rngvar to pass
**          to pst_rgrent(). RDF_UNFIX in pst_rgrent frees this memory.
**	17-jul-00 (hayke02)
**	    Set PSS_INNER_OJ in pss_stmt_flags if PST_INNER_OJ is set in
**	    pst_mask1.
**	27-nov-02 (inkdo01)
**	    Range table expansion.
**	15-june-06 (dougi)
**	    Add support for "before" triggers.
**	18-july-06 (dougi)
**	    Changes to handle expansion of views with derived table refs and

**	12-dec-2006 (dougi)
**	    Changes to the above to assure all derived tables are handled.
**	10-dec-2007 (smeke01) b118405
**	    Added code to reconstitute sess_cb pss_flattening_flags for 
**	    PSS_IFNULL_AGHEAD_MULTI, PSS_IFNULL_AGHEAD and PSS_AGHEAD_MULTI.
**	13-Dec-2008 (kiria01)
**	    Initialise build_indep_obj_list lest it mislead.
**      9-jun-2010 (huazh01)
**          Search for possible nested derived table after adding derived 
**          tables into a view's range table. (b123615)
**	28-Feb-2011 (kiria01) b123951
**	    Further WETREE entry missing from CTE processing.
**      28-Feb-2011 (coomi01) b125059
**          Move PSS_DERTAB_INQ into pss_stmt_flags2 for auto init.
**	9-Mar-2011 (kschendel) m1586
**	    For INSERT, post-process away unused vars if any (they would
**	    represent unused view where-clause components).  Also, if a
**	    view is the result table of an insert, a derived table in the
**	    query does not affect mergeability, since the derived table is
**	    necessarily elsewhere (ie not in the result-view itself).
**	    Declaring the result view non-mergeable in this situation causes
**	    a segv in the optimizer.
**	20-Apr-2011 (kschendel) b125294 m1897
**	    If a mergeable view was used in a subselect (ie derived table)
**	    in a FROM clause of a view, things went haywire most likely
**	    resulting in PS0002 from pst_proc_rgentry() and E_SC0206 from scf.
**	    If we process a mergeable view, make sure it's merged into all
**	    with- and derived- elements of the view parent, whether that is
**	    everything or some parent non-mergeable view.
**	18-May-2011 (smeke01) b125357
**	    During view substitution, if we have any table procs, run
**	    psy_subsvars() on each table proc parameter list in case
**	    any columns from the view are referenced.

/*{
** Name: psy_vrscan	- scan query tree and replace RESDOM nodes
**
** Description:
**	The query tree issued is scanned and RESDOM nodes are
**	converted to conform to the underlying base relations.
**	There are many checks in here, and things can fail
**	easily.
**
**	For all queries except DELETE and OPEN CURSOR, the target list 
**	of the query submitted is scanned down the left hand side (the 
**	RESDOM list). For each RESDOM, that variable is looked up in 
**	the view definition.  If the definition of it is not a simple
**	attribute, the query is aborted.
**
**	Then, if the variable appears anywhere in the qualification
**	of the view, the query is aborted.
**
**	Finally, we make sure that the result range variable doesn't change
**	into two range variables (e.g. the user is trying to update a two-
**	variable view).
**
**	And as the last step, we actually change the 'pst_resno' and
**	'pst_ntargno' for this RESDOM.
**
**	Notice that there are a number of overly restrictive
**	conditions on runability.  Notably, there are large classes
**	of queries which can run consistently but which violate
**	either the not-in-qualification condition or the aggregate-
**	free condition.

**	14-apr-92 (andre)
**	    fix bug 43640: at the time I wrote this function I have mistakenly
**	    assumed that ROOT's pst_tvrm reflects all range variables used in
**	    the query tree.  while this is true in QUEL, in SQL it is patently
**	    false.  Instead of looking at ROOT's pst_tvrm, we will scan the tree
**	    until we find a ROOT or PST_SUBSEL node with pst_tvrm indicating
**	    that a given range var was used in the tree rooted in the node
**	11-aug-92 (andre)
**	    one good bug deserves another - fix for bug 43640 introduced another
**	    bug - will I ever learn?..
**	    If a relation is used in a subselect inside of view's
**	    qualification, we should search that subselect's tree as a 
**	    whole as opposed to searching its (i.e. subselect tree's)
**	    qualification and then trying to map its target list which quite
**	    likely has nothing to do with the target list of the view tree
**	11-jun-93 (andre)
**	    OK, let's see if I get it right this time: until now this function
**	    failed to adequately address cases when a view is itself (or is
**	    based on) a QUEL view with aggregates.  AGGHEAD in a QUEL view has
**	    its own pst_tvrm and it is different from pst_tvrm in the root node.
**	    To fix this problem we must give up the assumption that pst_tvrm's
**	    are to be found only in PST_ROOT, root-level PST_SUBSELs and
**	    PST_SUBSELs inside the qualification
**	    To fix this problem, we will get rid of some shortcuts that relied
**	    on usage of pst_tvrm in SQL views and start looking for pst_tvrm's
**	    all over the view tree
**
**	    The resulting algorithm will be as follows:
**		1) check pst_tvrm of the ROOT node and, if the parent view is a
**		   UNION view, of other root-level PST_SUBSEL nodes; if a bit
**		   corresponding to our range var is set in one of those maps,
**		   we will scan the qualification of the tree + subtrees
**		   corresponding to the attributes of the parent view which are
**		   used in the query looking for attributes of the range
**		   variable whose range number was given to us;
**		2) if the first step failed to locate a reference to the range
**		   var whose range number was passed by the caller, we will call
**		   psy_rgvar_in_subtree() to look for PST_ROOT, PST_SUBSEL, or
**		   PST_AGGHEAD node whose pst_tvrm includes out range var; if
**		   such node is found, we will scan its subtrees looking for
**		   references to attributes of the range var whose range number
**		   was given to us
**		3) finally, if the above two steps failed (which, I think, can
**		   happen if the parent is a QUEL view or some of its underlying
**		   views are QUEL views), we will call psy_rgvar_in_subtree() to
**		   examine subtrees of attributes of the parent view looking for
**		   PST_AGHEAD node whose pst_tvrm includes our range var;
**		   once such node is found, if the attribute in whose subtree it
**		   was found was referenced in the query, we will scan its
**		   subtrees looking for references to attributes of the range
**		   var whose range number was given to us
**
**		We will try to optimize our search for pst_tvrm mentioning the
**		range var whose number was given to us for views which do not
**		involve QUEL attributes in their target lists (which I hope
**		represents the majority of views.)  Accordingly, rather than
**		check pst_tvrm of PST_ROOT, then search the qualification, then
**		search the target list for every root-level PST_SUBSEL node, we
**		will perform step (1) for PST_ROOT and all root-level PST_SUBSEL
**		nodes, then step (2) and step (3).

** Name: psy_build_audit_info - Build C2 audit info into query plan
**
** Description:
**      This routine is responsible for building the two structures needed
**      by QEF for auditing access to tables and views each time the 
**      query is executed and for listing the security alarms which 
**      will have to be applied each time a query is executed.
**
** Inputs:
**	sess_cb 			Session control block pointer.
**      rngtab                          Pointer to array of range variables.
**      qmode                           Query mode of range variable, i.e. how
**					it's being used
**      mstream                         Memory stream to allocate memory.
**
** Outputs:
**	err_blk				Filled in if an error happened
**	Returns:
**	    E_DB_OK			Success
**	    E_DB_ERROR			Failure
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	    Can allocate memory
**	    Does catalog I/O
**
** History:
**	20-jul-89 (jennifer)
**          Created.
**	12-mar-90 (andre)
**	    set rdr_2types_mask to 0.
**      22-may-90 (teg)
**          init rdr_instr to RDF_NO_INSTR
**      08-aug-90 (ralph)
**          Fix apr queueing.
**	16-dec-90 (ralph)
**	    Trigger security_alarm for failed attempts (b34903).
**	    This involves a minor interface change to doaudit().
**	01-nov-91 (andre)
**	    cleanup some minor bugs
**	4-may-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Added support for PSQ_DGTT_AS_SELECT
**	29-sep-92 (andre)
**	    RDF may choose to allocate a new info block and return its address
**	    in rdf_info_blk - we need to copy it over to pss_rdrinfo to avoid
**	    memory leak and other assorted unpleasantries
**	3-apr-93 (markg)
**	    Moved this routine from psypermit.c and changed it to allow it
**	    to be called multiple times. This enables the auditing data
**	    structures to be built up as the views in a query are being
**	    unravelled.
**	5-jul-93 (robf)
**	    When building the art use QEF definitions, not DMF, and 
**	    also note if its a system catalog
**	10-aug-93 (andre)
**	    fixed causes of compiler warnings
**	15-sep-93 (robf)
**           Don't audit SETINPUT temporary tables. 
**	21-oct-93 (stephenb)
**	    Altered so that we audit when statement is INSERT....VALUES. Also
**	    made sure we do not audit SETINPUT temporary tables.
**	16-nov-93 (stephenb)
**	    Added functionality for PSQ_REPCURS, becuase we now audit update
**	    where current of cursor.
**	24-nov-93 (robf)
**           Filter out FAILURE alarms, and assign flags.
**	2-dec-93 (robf)
**           Renamed psy_build_audit_info() since doaudit() is a tad vague
**	13-dec-93 (robf)
**           Build subject type into qef_gtype, not qef_type
**	12-jan-94 (robf)
**           Add modes PSQ_REPCURS, PSQ_DELCURS
**	1-feb-94 (stephenb)
**	    Backed out INSERT fixes for 21-oct.
**	3-feb-94 (robf)
**           Check for session temp tables.
**	1-mar-94 (robf)
**	     Initialize status.
**	29-mar-94 (robf)
**            Remove check for session temp tables, not fully available in
**	      DMF and may not be set at this point.
**	6-may-94 (robf)
**	     Add space between =& to quieten VMS compiler
**	12-jul-94 (robf)
**           Only look up alarms if table is marked as having them.
**      30-Oct-2008 (hanal04) Bug 120702
**           Completely initialise aud variable to prevent later SEGVs.

** Name: psy_ubtid	- determine whether the view tree contains id of its

**
** Description:
** 	This function will obtain a view tree and if it contains id of that 
**	view's underlying base table, make a copy of it for the caller
**
** Input:
**	rngvar		range table entry describing a view whose tree must be 
**			fetched
**	sess_cb		PSF session CB
**
** Output:
**	err_blk		filled in if an error occurs
**	ubt_id		filled in with id of the view's underlying base table if
**			the view tree contains one; 0'd out otherwise
**
** History:
**	21-aug-93 (andre)
**	    written
**	16-nov-93 (andre)
**	    this function will not return ids of catalogs because we do not want
**	    to alter their timestamps as means of forcing QEP invalidation.
