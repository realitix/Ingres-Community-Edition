/**
**
**  Name: PSYPERMIT.C - Functions for applying permits
**
**  Description:
**	This module performs the INGRES protection algorithm, as
**	presented in Stonebraker & Rubinstein, "The INGRES Protection
**	System", with a few modifications.
**
**	The basic algorithm is as follows:
**
**	The algorithm is applied once to each variable used in the
**	query.  Each variable has an initial check performed to
**	determine applicability -- if the current user owns the
**	relation, or if the relation is specially marked as being
**	"all access to everyone", then the algorithm is skipped,
**	thereby having effectively no restriction.
**
**	The set of all such variables is computed in 'protect',
**	and then 'dopro' is called to process each of those.  This
**	is so the protection algorithm does not get applied recursively
**	to constraints which define more than one variable.  Notice
**	that this could in itself be a protection violation, if it
**	were acceptable to reference a relation you do not own in a
**	PERMIT statement.
**
**	The effective query mode for this variable is then computed.
**	This is the same as the query mode of the whole query if
**	the variable in question is the result variable, otherwise
**	it is "retrieve" mode.
**
**	The next step is to scan the query tree and create sets of
**	domains referenced.  Four sets are created:
**		uset -- the set of domains updated (actually,
**			referenced in the target list -- on a
**			retrieve, this will be the set of domains
**			retrieved to the user).
**		rset -- the set of domains retrieved in some
**			context other than the left hand side of
**			an equal sign.
**		aset -- the set of domains aggregated.  This only
**			includes domains aggregated with a simple
**			aggregate (not an aggregate function) with
**			no qualification, since it may be possible
**			to come up with too much information other-
**			wise.
**		qset -- the set of domains retrieved for use in
**			a qualification, but never stored.  This
**			includes domains in a qualification of an
**			aggregate or aggregate function.
**	For more details of domains in each of these sets, look at
**	the routine 'makedset'.
**
**	If we had a retrieve operation in the first place, we will
**	then merge 'uset' into 'rset' and clear 'uset', so that
**	now 'uset' only contains domains which are actually updated,
**	and 'rset' contains all domains which are retrieved.
**
**	Now that we know what is referenced, we can scan the protection
**	catalog.  We scan the entire catalog once for each variable
**	mentioned in the query (except as already taken care of as
**	described above).
**
**	We must create a set of all operations on this variable which
**	are not yet resolved, that is, for which no PERMIT statements
**	which qualify have been issued.  We store this set in the
**	variable "noperm".  As PERMIT statements are found, bits will
**	be cleared.  If the variable is not zero by the end of the
**	scan of the protection catalog, then we reject the query,
**	saying that we don't have permission -- giving us default
**	to deny.
**
**	For each tuple in the protection catalog for this relation,
**	we call "proappl" to see if it applies to this query.  This
**	routine checks the user, terminal, time of day, and so forth
**	(in fact, everything which is query-independent) and tells
**	whether this tuple might apply.
**
**	If the tuple passes this initial check, we then do the query-
**	dependent checking.  This amounts to calling "prochk" once
**	for each operation (and domain set) in the query.  What we
**	get back is a set of operations which this tuple applies to.
**	If zero, the tuple doesn't apply at all; otherwise, it
**	applies to at least one operation.  If it applies to some-
**	thing, we call it "interesting".
**
**	For "interesting" tuples, we now get the corresponding
**	qualification (if one exists), and build up the bit-maps
**	(qmaps) for each operation indicating which qualifications
**	are applicable. Also, we mark
**	any operations we found as having been done, by clearing
**	bits in "noperm".
**
**	When we have completed scanning the protection catalog,
**	we check "noperm".  If it is non-zero, then we have some
**	operation for which a PERMIT statement has not been issued,
**	and we issue an error message.  
**
**	Now, using the qmaps, construct the appropriate Boolean
**	combination of quals (disjoin within a single qmap set,
**	and conjoin between qmap sets), minimizing the Boolean
**	expression where possible to avoid unnecessary redundancy.
**	The result, if non-null, is conjoined to the query tree
**	which is re-normalized.
**
**	Then we go on and try the next variable.
**
**	Finally, we return the root of the modified tree.  This
**	tree is guaranteed to have no authorization violations,
**	and may be run as a regular query.

**          Adapted from version 4.0 protect.c
**      03-sep-86 (seputis)
**          Fixed SCU_INFORMATION call to set array length
**	03-dec-87 (stec)
**	    Change psy_apql interface.
**	04-jan-88 (stec)
**	    General cleanup.
**	23-feb-88 (stec)
**	    When merging permit vars (if qual present), handle
**	    gracefully missing table case.
**	11-may-88 (stec)

**	04-aug-88 (andre)
**	    Added new procedure - psy_dbpperm - to check if a user has
**	    permission to execute a database procedure.
**	19-aug-1988 (andre)
**	    fixed the bug that allowed one to bypass any checking when
**	    qmode==PSQ_RETINTO.  It was definitely wrong, as only the tables
**	    from which data was retrieved are ever placed into rngvar, and
**	    the processing should be identical to one done when qmode is set to
**	    PSQ_RETRIEVE.
**	28-sep-88 (stec)
**	    Correct a typo in psy_dbpperm.
**	04-nov-88 (stec)
**	    For extended catalogs explicit privilege required
**	    (catalog update priv insufficient).
**	    Undo the change above - otherwise utilities like
**	    CREATEDB are likely to have problems.
**	11-nov-88 (stec)
**	    Change defn of time zone (for Unix).
**	30-nov-88 (stec)
**	    Improve error recovery in psy_dbpperm.
**	02-dec-88 (stec)
**	    Change psy_dbpperm to process rdf_call status differently.
**	05-mar-89 (ralph)
**	    GRANT Enhancements, Phase 1:
**	    psy_dbpperm() checks for permits defined for group/application id's
**	    proappl()     checks for permits defined for group/application id's

**	    If a  user has no permission to retrieve from an index, check
**	    permissions on the underlying table instead.
**      24-jul-89 (jennifer)
**          Added auditing of event if protections cause failure.
**      24-jul-89 (jennifer)
**          Added new routine doaudit to build an audit range table and 
**          and audit alarm permit list if protections pass.
**          This will be attached to statement header and onto the QP.
**	14-sep-89 (andre)

**	    below.)

**	23-aug-90 (ralph)
**	    Added psy_cpyperm to check permits for COPY.
**	    Audit dbproc execution in psy_dbpperm.
**	    Change interface to psy_dbpperm to include psq_cb and pss_sesblk.
**	10-sep-90 (andre)
**	    fixed bugs # 33040, 33041, and 33042
**		This bug had to do with checking permits on tables/views used in
**	    definition of non-mergeable view s.t. its (i.e. the nonmergeable
**	    view's) permissions were not checked (note that to qualify for such
**	    treatment, the view must have been owned by the current user or must
**	    have been a QUEL view.)
**		The problem is that nonmergeable views are not merged into the
**	    main query tree (surprise, surprise...), and yet we try to look for
**	    attributes of the tables/views used in their definition in the main
**	    query tree.  Clearly, our search always fails, and so we allow users
**	    to retrieve information through nonmergeable views with no regard
**	    for existing permits.
**		The solution is as follows:
**		    1) let R be the range variable used in definition of a
**		       nonmergeable view V, and during this pass psy_protect()
**		       is expected to check if the user has appropriate
**		       permissions on R (note that since nonmergeable views are
**		       not updateable, we only need to determine if the user has
**		       RETRIEVE privilege on some subset of attributes of R)
**		    2) for each table/view which has to be checked for
**		       approrpiate permissions AND which was entered into the
**		       range table because it was used in definition of a
**		       nonmergeable view (note that the only reason we would be
**		       checking permissions of a table/view used in the
**		       definition of V, if V was owned by the current user or
**		       was a QUEL view), an attribute map will be built as
**		       follows:
**			    a) if V was not itself used in the definition of a
**			       nonmergeable view, first the main query tree will
**			       be searched for attributes of V (this will be
**			       done by the function calling psy_protect()),
**			    b) the definition of these attributes of V AND the
**			       qualification tree of V will be searched for
**			       attributes of R;
**		       NOTE: if V itself was used in the definition of some
**			     nonmergeable view V', first a map of attributes of
**			     V used in the main query tree or in the
**			     qualification of V' will be built, and then we will
**			     generate a map of attributes of R used in the main
**			     query tree or in the qualification of V; one can
**			     easily extend this algorithm.
**	14-sep-90 (teresa)
**	    pss_catupd becomes bitflag rather than boolean.
**	16-dec-90 (ralph)
**	    Trigger security_alarm for failed attempts (b34903)
**	    This involves a minor interface change to doaudit().
**	20-feb-91 (andre)
**	    Changed interface for psy_dbpperm(): add a pointer to session CB
**	    and remove pointers to user, group, and role identifiers since they
**	    can all be obtained from the session CB.
**	21-feb-91 (andre)
**	    - changed interface for proappl(): there is no need to supply user,
**	      role, and group identifiers separately since they can be found in
**	      sess_cb;
**	    - defined psy_grantee_ok(); is will be used by psy_dbpperm(),
**	      psy_cpyperm(), and proappl().
**	4-may-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Added support for PSQ_DGTT and PSQ_DGTT_AS_SELECT
**  	24-sep-92 (stevet)
**  	    Implemented the new timezone adjustment method by
**  	    replacing TMzone() with TMtz_search() routine.
**	04-dec-1992 (pholman)
**	    C2: replace obsolete qeu_audit with psy_secaudit.
**	14-dec-92 (walt)
**	    Replaced \T with \t in a TRdisplay format in psy_check_permits to
**	    silence a compiler warning about illegal display formats on Alpha.
**	08-dec-92 (anitap)
**	    Changed the order of #includes of header files for CREATE SCHEMA.
**	15-dec-92 (wolf) 
**	    ulf.h must be included before qsf.h
**	23-mar-93 (smc)
**	    Cast STskipblank function parameter to match prototype. Commented
**	    string following endif.
**	3-apr-1993 (markg)
**	    Moved the doaudit() routine from this file to psyview.c so that
**	    the audit data structures that are built contain the correct
**	    data. Added a new routine do_alarm() which in C2 servers checks
**	    for security alarms which need to be fired for failing queries. 
**	29-jun-93 (andre)
**	    #included CV.H
**	14-jul-93 (ed)
**	    replacing <dbms.h> by <gl.h> <sl.h> <iicommon.h> <dbdbms.h>
**	10-aug-93 (andre)
**	    fixed causes of compiler warnings
**	10-nov-93 (anitap)
**	    If pss_ses_flag = PSS_INGRES_PRIV, then do not check the privileges.
**	    $ingres in verifydb should be able to "alter table drop constraint"
**	    on another user's table. Changes in psy_protect().
**	11-nov-93 (stephenb)
**	    Include psyaudit.h for prototyping.
**	17-nov-93 (rblumer)
**	    Fix regression in WGO test suite due to misplaced parentheses
**	    around check for PSS_INGRES_PRIV bit.
**	    Also fixed some compiler warnings by removing unused variables,etc.
**	11-oct-1993 (tad)
**	    Bug #56449
**	    Changed %x to %p for pointer values in prochk().
**	24-jan-1997 (kch)
**	    In the function psy_protect(), we now check for
**	    viewinfo[rngvar->pss_rgno] == NULL during the scan of the range
**	    table. In psy_view(), the view info structure will not be allocated
**	    if
**	    - this view (or a view defined on top of it) is a target of
**	      UPDATE, INSERT, or DELETE, and
**	    - there are rules defined on it, and
**	    - the rules have not been checked to see if any of them apply.
**	    This change fixes bug 80279.
**	23-May-1997 (shero03)
**	    Save the rdr_info_blk after an UNFIX
**	27-oct-1998 (matbe01)
**	    Added NO_OPTIM for NCR (nc4_us5).
**	14-May-1999 (carsu07)
**	    The function psy_check_permits scans through 20 permits at a time
**	    unless the WGO was set. Part of checking this permission involves 
**	    checking if the definition is of a dbproc which appears to be 
**	    grantable so far has WGO.  However if you're not using dbprocs, then
**   	    the if statement fails and privs_wgo is set.
**	    This in turn means no futher permissions are checked. (Bug 80064)
**	8-nov-1999 (nanpr01)
**	    No need to check terminal/time if the permits are granted 
**	    through SQL because these can not be specified.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	10-Jan-2001 (jenjo02)
**	    Added *PSS_SELBLK parm to psf_mopen(), psf_mlock(), psf_munlock(),
**	    psf_malloc(), psf_mclose(), psf_mroot(), psf_mchtyp(),
**	    pst_treedup(), psy_check_objprivs(), psy_insert_objpriv(),
**	    psy_check_colpriv(), psy_insert_colpriv().
**	17-Jan-2001 (jenjo02)
**	    Short-circuit calls to psy_secaudit() if not C2SECURE.
**	20-Jul-2004 (schka24)
**	    Fix bug that stopped looking for unconditional permits when
**	    the required privs were satisfied, but only with conditional
**	    permits.
**	21-Nov-2004 (kodse01)
**	    BUG 113504
**	    In function psy_cpyperm, removed the condition where COPY_INTO 
**	    permission is granted if DMT_RETRIEVE_PRO bit is off.
**	28-nov-2007 (dougi)
**	    Added PSQ_REPDYN to all PSQ_DEFCURS tests for cached dynamic.
**      17-dec-2008 (joea)
**          Replace READONLY/WSCREADONLY by const.
**      01-apr-2010 (stial01)
**          Changes for Long IDs
**	21-Oct-2010 (kiria01) b124629
**	    Use the macro symbol with ult_check_macro instead of literal.
**	08-Nov-2010 (kiria01) SIR 124685
**	    Rationalise function prototypes
**       4-Jul-2011 (hanal04) SIR 125458
**          Add DB_ERROR support (__FILE__, __LINE__) to PSF and to user
**          error functions in SCF.
**      13-Jul-2011 (hanal04) SIR 125458
**          Update cs_elog calls inline with sc0e_putAsFcn changes.

** Name: PSY_QMAP - Qualification map
**
** Description:
**      This structure tells which qualifications have been used for which
**	types of operations.
**
**	There are four entries in the qmap array, for update, retrieve,
**	aggregate, and test respectively.  ("update" meaning update,
**	delete, append, etc;  only one kind of update priv can be required
**	for any one statement, I think, and in any case they are all
**	considered together.)
**
**	q_map has bit N set if permit number N in the psy_pqual array
**		contributes to this privilege.
**	q_applies is used in the check-permits loop to record whether
**		the permit we're examining confers this privilege.
**	q_usemap says whether the privilege is conditional or not.
**		Unconditional privs don't look at the psy_pqual trees.
**	q_unqual also says that we've found an unconditional privilege.
**		(We need it to distinguish "known unconditional" from
**		"we haven't started yet".)
**
** History:
**     23-jun-86 (jeff)

**	    E_DB_ERROR			Failure
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	    Can allocate memory
**	    Does catalog I/O
**
** History:
**	23-jun-86 (jeff)
**          Adapted from protect() in 4.0
**      04-sep-86 (seputis)
**          get result range var from aux table instead of sess_cb
**	03-aug-88 (stec)
**	    Fix "append to somebody's table always successful" bug.
**	04-nov-88 (stec)
**	    For extended catalogs explicit privilege required
**	    (catalog update priv insufficient).
**	22-jun-89 (andre)
**	    If the object belongs to the current user, set delall to TRUE iff
**	    the object is a table.  This will fix a following class of bugs:
**	    DBA grants user U a select permit on table T;
**	    U create view V "as select * from T";
**	    U declares a cursor on V and proceeds to delete all entries.
**	03-aug-89 (andre)
**	    If a user has no permissions to retrieve from an index I, check
**	    permissions on the underlying table T, and if an appropriate
**	    permit has been found, allow user to retrieve from U.  The change
**	    will only effect SQL queries.  Similar (but somewhat more
**	    complicated) solution for QUEL will follow.
**      24-jul-89 (jennifer)
**          Added auditing of event if protections cause failure.
**      24-jul-89 (jennifer)
**          Added new routine doaudit to build an audit range table and 
**          and audit alarm permit list if protections pass.
**          This will be attached to statement header and onto the QP.
**	14-sep-89 (andre)
**	    Accept ptr to a var containign number of joins found in the query so
**	    far.  If we intend to use a permit with qualification which
**	    involves joins (this may only occur when processing a QUEL query and
**	    using a permit created via CREATE PERMIT in SQL), we need to
**	    increment group_id field in all operator nodes which have a valid
**	    group_id by the number of joins found so far.  We will also need to
**	    reset outer_rel masks in the range table entry(ies) for the table(s)
**	    used in the qualification of the permit.
**	    Also, interface to pst_treedup() has changed.
**	12-mar-90 (andre)
**	    set rdr_2types_mask to 0.
**      22-may-90 (teg)
**          init rdr_instr to RDF_NO_INSTR
**	14-sep-90 (teresa)
**	    pss_catupd becomes bitflag rather than boolean.
**	17-sep-90 (andre)
**	    added a new argument - viewinfo.  this was done as a part of
**	    the fix for bugs 33040, 33041, and 33042.  viewinfo is an array of
**	    pointers to structures providing additional information about views.
**	    They are guaranteed to indicate if a given view was created in SQL
**	    or QUEL.  More importantly, for any non-mergeable view V s.t. we
**	    need to check permissions on some relation R used in its definition,
**	    a map (in reverse) of attributes of V which are used in the main
**	    query will be available.  By examining view tree of V, we can build
**	    a map of attributes of R for which SELECT permission must be
**	    checked.  Note that at present in SQL we do not recognize
**	    permissions on individual columns, so an easy was to speed things up
**	    for SQL is to avoid walking V's tree altogether, and look for
**	    "GRANT-compatible" SELECT permission on R
**	29-nov-90 (andre)
**	    A fix made by me on 8/3/89 had a problem: user trying to RETRIEVE
**	    from an index owned by someone else would invariably get a
**	    "unexpected internal error" message.  This was caused by the fact
**	    that dopro() would be instructed to return error message number
**	    inside the error block rather than to print it, but psy_protect()
**	    would not call dopro() again to check for permissions on the
**	    underlying base table (the latter part was intentional - the use of
**	    permissions on underlying table was intended only for SQL queries).
**	    The solution implemented back then can be substantially simplified:
**		1) IF the current object is an index and
**		      the query language is SQL and
**		      the query is NOT trying to update the current object
**		   THEN
**		      save the range var representing the index (in ind_rngvar)
**		      obtain the description of the underlying table and apply
**		      preliminary checking (i.e. check for ALL/RETRIEVE_TO_ALL,
**		      etc.)
**		      if we still need to invoke dopro, remember to pass
**		      ind_rgvar (for error reporting) and a 0'd out attribute
**		      map to dopro()
**		   ENDIF
**
**	    Note that the above solution relies on the newly introduced
**	    mechanism whereby we can provide dopro() with map of attributes
**	    which must be accessed.  Furthermore, since for SQL we only
**	    recognize GRANT-compatible permits, setting the attribute mask to
**	    all 0's will cause dopro() to reset it to all 1's and check for
**	    SELECT permission on all columns of the underlying base table.
**	    NOTE that this also requires a change in dopro() interface (see the
**	    comment in dopro() prolog)
**	16-dec-90 (ralph)
**	    Trigger security_alarm for failed attempts (b34903).
**	    This involves a minor interface change to doaudit().
**	01-apr-91 (andre)
**	    the above-mentioned fix for bugs 33040-33042 had one little,
**	    but quite unpleasant problem:
**		nmv_map gets populated with offsets into rngtab of non-mergeable
**		views, unfortunately, they can get overwritten with -1 since
**		instead of initializing the entries to -1 before entering the
**		loop, I chose to do it inside the loop; the recipe for disaster:
**		any script which causes a non-mergeable view with range number N
**		be placed in entry M of rngtab where M<N.
**	07-aug-91 (andre)
**	    qmode may be set to PSQ_VIEW to indicate that the function is being
**	    called in the course of determining whether the view being created
**	    is not abandoned
**	25-sep-91 (andre)
**	    When parsing definitions of views and dbprocs we need to build a map
**	    of independent objects (including privileges.)  Using ALL_TO_ALL and
**	    RETR_TO_ALL to avoid a "full-fledged protection algorithm" makes it
**	    impossible for dopro() to build a complete map of independent
**	    privileges.
**	    Accordingly, we will postpone use of relstat bits to satisfy
**	    privileges until dopro() if we are processing a definition of a view
**	    or a dbproc.
**	01-nov-91 (andre)
**	    at least for now there seems to be no reason to call doaudit() for
**	    database procedures: security alarms are not looked up when
**	    processing dbprocs and table information which does get built is
**	    disregarded later on.
**	4-may-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Added support for PSQ_DGTT and PSQ_DGTT_AS_SELECT
**	15-jun-92 (barbara)
**	    Change interface to pst_rgent().
**	10-Feb-93 (Teresa)
**	    Changed RDF_GETINFO to RDF_READTUPLES for new RDF I/F
**	03-apr-93 (markg)
**	    Removed calls to doaudit() as this functionality is now being
**	    performed in psyview.c. Added calls to the do_alarm() routine
**	    for failing queries in C2 servers.
**	04-apr-93 (andre)
**	    psy_protect() may now get called in the course of processing cursor
**	    UPDATE/REPLACE if a cursor was declared using QUEL and at DECLARE
**	    CURSOR time we could not ascertain that the user possesses
**	    unconditional RETRIEVE privilege on every column of the table/view
**	    on which the cursor is defined
**	20-may-93 (andre)
**	    fix for bug 51965:
**		before calling dopro(), we perform special processing if the
**		relation was referenced in a non-mergeable view or if a
**		relation turns out to be an index.  However, the order in which
**		we performed our checks was incorrect.  Instead of checking if
**		an index is being used in SQL query with effective query mode of
**		RETRIEVE only if it was not used in a non-mergeable view, we
**		need to check whether it was an index first.  This will ensure
**		that if a non-mergeable view was based on an index, we will
**		check permissions on the index' base table instead of trying to
**		look for permissions on the index which is very unlikely to be
**		there.
**	17-jun-93 (andre)
**	    changed interface of psy_secaudit() to accept PSS_SESBLK
**	5-jul-93 (robf)
**	    changed interface of psy_secaudit() to accept security label
**	10-nov-93 (anitap)
**	    If pss_ses_flag = PSS_INGRES_PRIV, then do not check the privileges.
**	    $ingres in verifydb should be able to "alter table drop constraint"
**	    on another user's table.
**	17-nov-93 (rblumer)
**	    Fix regression in WGO test suite due to misplaced parentheses
**	    around check for PSS_INGRES_PRIV bit.
**	22-nov-93 (robf)
**          Make do_alarm public, now called psy_do_alarm_fail()
**	17-mar-94 (robf)
**          Use distinct flag for select_all rather than piggy-backing
**	    from the drop_all
**	24-jan-1997 (kch)
**	    We now check for viewinfo[rngvar->pss_rgno] == NULL during the
**	    scan of the range table. In psy_view(), the view info structure
**	    will not be allocated if
**	    - this view (or a view defined on top of it) is a target of
**	      UPDATE, INSERT, or DELETE, and
**	    - there are rules defined on it, and
**	    - the rules have not been checked to see if any of them apply.
**	    This change fixes bug 80279.
**	3-dec-2008 (dougi) BUG 121319
**	    Don't do the check when "table" is actually a table procedure.
**      18-Mar-2009 (hanal04) Bug 121807
**          No need to check permissions for derrived table range entries.
**          The underlying tables and views will be checked separately and
**          the simulated RDF structures generated by pst_sdent() will
**          cause psy_checkPermits() to SEGV.
**      15-Oct-2010 (hanal04) Bug 124600
**          Security auditing was failing to log illegal access to a
**          view because we were telling the security autiting system that
**          the event was a table access. Set the eventtype to SXF_E_VIEW
**          if the rngvar is a view.

** Name: psy_dbpperm	- Check if the user has permission to execute dbproc

** Description:
**      This function fetches all protection tuples applicable to a given
**	dbproc until there are no more left (failure) or one is found
**	that indicates that the user has permission to execute (success).
**	IMPORTANT: this function expects to be called when processing a
**		   dbproc invocation (as a part of CREATE RULE,
**		   EXECUTE PROCEDURE or recreation of a dbproc) or when
**		   processing GRANT ON PROCEDURE (if the user does not own the
**		   dbproc we want to make sure that he has EXECUTE WGO on the
**		   dbproc).
**	
** Inputs:
**	sess_cb			    PSF session CB
**	rdf_cb			    ptr to RDF CB which was used to retrieve
**				    IIPROCEDURE tuple describing the dbproc
**	    rdf_info_blk->rdr_dbp   IIPROCEDURE tuple
**      psq_cb			    ptr to psq_cb
**	    psq_mode		    mode of the statement (must be one of
**				    PSQ_EXEDBP, PSQ_CALLPROC, PSQ_RULE, or
**				    PSQ_GRANT)
**	dbp_id			    dbproc id
**	dbp_owner		    dbproc owner
**	dbp_name		    dbproc name
**	required_privs		    addr of a map of privileges required by the
**				    statement being processed
**
** Outputs:
**	psq_cb->
**		psq_error	    Filled in if an error happened
**	required_privs		    0 if all required privileges have been
**				    satisfied; map of privileges which the user
**				    lacks otherwise; should be consulted only if
**				    !DB_FAILURE_MACRO(status)
**
** Returns:
**	E_DB_OK			    Success - need to check *required_privs to
**				    determine if the user indeed poseses
**				    sufficient privileges
**	E_DB_ERROR		    Failure
**
** Exceptions:
**	none
**
** Side Effects:
**	May do catalog I/O

**          Don't interpret security alarms as permits.
**	27-sep-90 (ralph)
**	    Audit dbproc execution in psy_dbpperm.
**	    Change interface to psy_dbpperm to include psq_cb and pss_sesblk.
**	20-feb-91 (andre)
**	    Changed interface for psy_dbpperm(): add a pointer to session CB
**	    and remove pointers to user, group, and role identifiers since they
**	    can all be obtained from the session CB.
**	21-feb-91 (andre)
**	    call newly defined psy_grantee_ok() to determine if, based on
**	    grantee name and type, the permit applies to this session;
**	20-sep-91 (andre)
**	    psy_dbpperm() can be called to determine if a given user can grant a
**	    permit on a dbproc; note that in case of GRANT only failure to
**	    create a permit due to insufficient privileges will be audited
**	23-sep-91 (andre)   (SEE 01-oct-91 (andre))
**	    when processing GRANT ON PROCEDURE use PSS_INSUF_DBP_PRIVS (over
**	    sess_cb->pss_stmt_flags) to indicate that the user may not grant the
**	    desired privilege on the dbproc.  Lack of required privileges in
**	    this case will not result in status being set to E_DB_ERROR, thus
**	    allowing user to distinguish between lack of privileges and other
**	    errors.
**	26-sep-91 (andre)
**	    if we are checking if the current user can invoke a dbproc P' not
**	    owned by him in the course of parsing dbproc P, check the list of
**	    independent privileges for occurrence of P' and if none was found,
**	    add it to the list
**	30-sep-91 (andre)
**	    elements of the list of independent objects will be allocated from
**	    the stream pointed to by sess_cb->pss_dependencies_stream.
**	01-oct-91 (andre)
**	    added insuf_privs to psy_dbpperm()'s interface; as a result the
**	    (23-sep-91) is no longer valid - regardless of the query mode,
**	    if the user lacks some of the required privileges, *insuf_privs will
**	    be set to TRUE, but status will not be set to E_DB_ERROR.
**	03-oct-91 (andre)
**	    if we are reparsing a dbproc definition to determine if the dbproc
**	    is grantable, we MUST find EXECUTE WGO.  While in other cases, we
**	    are satisfied with resetting PSS_DBPGRANT_OK bit in pss_dbp_flags,
**	    in this case, we will report lack of EXECUTE WGO as an error.
**	04-oct-91 (andre)
**	    When searching for an independent object privilege descriptor
**	    pertaining to this dbproc, if one is found in the sublist associated
**	    with the dbproc being parsed, we are done.  If one is found outside
**	    the current sublist, copy it into the current sublist and we are
**	    done.  Only if such descriptor could not be found, we will create a
**	    new descriptor, insert it into the sublist associated with the
**	    dbproc being parsed and then proceed to determine if it is
**	    grantable.
**	    NOTE: an independent privilege entry may indicate that a dbproc is
**	    ungrantable which would make the dbproc being parsed ungrantable as
**	    well.
**	12-feb-92 (andre)
**	    Caller will no longer pass addr of a flag which will
**	    be used to indicate that the user lacked some required privilege(s),
**	    instead, caller will pass addr of a map of a privilege required for
**	    the statement, and psy_dbpperm() will reset it to 0 if the user
**	    posesses all required privileges.  In some cases, when, in fact,
**	    the privilege must be grantable, psy_dbpperm() may choose to set
**	    DB_GRANT_OPTION bit in *required_privs
**	10-Feb-93 (Teresa)
**	    Changed RDF_GETINFO to RDF_READTUPLES for new RDF I/F
**	13-apr-93 (andre)
**	    do not add privileges on dbprocs to the independent privilege list
**	    if parsing a system-generated dbproc
**	17-jun-93 (andre)
**	    changed interface of psy_secaudit() to accept PSS_SESBLK
**	25-oct-93 (robf)
**          Audit security label for procedure 
**      02-nov-93 (andre)
**          if the user attempting to grant a privilege on a dbproc X possesses
**          no privileges whatsoever on X, rather than issuing a message saying
**          that he cannot grant some privilege(s) on X, we will issue a message
**          saying that EITHER X does not exist OR the user may not access it.
**	20-dec-93 (stephenb)
**	    correct call to psy_secaudit(), we were oring two access types
**	    and a condition, it should only be a condition and one access type.
**	09-Sep-2008 (jonj)
**	    2nd param to psf_error() is i4, not DB_ERROR.

** Name: dopro	- Do the protection algorithm
**
** Description:
**      This is the guts of the protection algorithm, broken off because it
**	must be called recursively on aggregates.  The algorithm is as
**	discussed in the module header.
**
** Inputs:
**      rngvar                          Pointer to range variable slot to get
**					permission on
**      root                            Root of query tree to get permission on
**      qmode                           Query mode of range variable, i.e. how
**					it's being used
**	query_mode			mode of the query
**	byset				Ptr to column set of `by' domains;
**					NULL if none
**	retrtoall			TRUE iff retrieve to all permission
**					given on this range variable
**	sess_cb				Pointer to session control block
**	rngtab				Pointer to current range table
**	rdf_cb				Pointer to RDF_CB to use for permit
**					tuples
**	rdf_tree_cb			Pointer to RDF_CB to use for query trees
**	dup_rb->			Ptr to dup. request block.
**	    pss_op_mask			indicator of requested services
**	    pss_num_joins		number of joins found in the tree so far
**	    pss_rsdm_no			resdom number which may be used to
**					renumber RESDOM nodes when copying a
**					tree
**	    pss_tree_info		ptr to mask to contain all sorts of
**					useful info about a tree beign
**					duplicated
**	    pss_mstream			memory stream to be used
**	    pss_err_blk			error block used when reporting errors
**	err_rngvar			range variable to pass to psy_error() if
**					adequate permissions were not found;
**					this will be NULL unless an SQL user
**					tries to (explicitly or implicitly)
**					retrieve from an index owned by another
**					user
**	attrmap				if the relation was used in definition
**					of a non-mergeable view
**					(rngvar->pss_rgparent != -1), attrmap
**					will contain map of attributes of the
**					relation, so we will not walk the tree,
**					but skip to the code that calls RDF to
**					read DB_PROTECT tuples; otherwise
**					attrmap will be set to NULL;
**					this will also be non-null if err_rngvar
**					is non-NULL (i.e. if we are checking
**					permissions on a table different from
**					the one specified by the user as would
**					occur when an SQL user tries to retrieve
**					from an index owned by another user)
**
** Outputs:
**      root                            Query tree may be modified
**	byset				Column set of by domains
**      rngtab                          New range vars may be entered
**	dup_rb->
**	    pss_err_blk			Filled in if an error happened

** Side Effects:
**	    Can allocate memory

**
** History:
**	23-jun-86 (jeff)
**          Adapted from dopro() in 4.0
**	03-dec-87 (stec)
**	    Change psy_apql interface.
**	23-feb-88 (stec)
**	    When merging permit vars (if qual present), handle
**	    gracefully missing table case.
**	03-sep-88 (andre)
**	    Modify call to pst_rgent to pass 0 as a query mode since it is
**	    clearly not PSQ_DESTROY.
**	05-mar-89 (ralph)
**	    GRANT Enhancements, Phase 1:
**	    Pass session's group/application id's to proappl().
**	22-jun-89 (andre)
**	    dopro() will receive a real query mode along with effective query
**	    mode which have been passed up 'till now.
**	10-jul-89 (andre)
**	    Added new argument - mask - to communicate all sorts of useful info.
**	14-sep-89 (andre)
**	    Will accept a new parameter - dup_rb.  It will contain ptr to a
**	    memory stream and error block, in addition to being preset for
**	    passing to pst_treedup()
**      08-aug-90 (ralph)
**          Don't interpret security alarms as permits.
**	18-sep-90 (andre)
**	    added a new attribute - attrmap; this attribute will be used when
**	    the relation permissions on which need to be checked was used in the
**	    definition of a non-mergeable view, in which case the current
**	    algorithm will fail to find even the trace of the relation in the
**	    main query tree
**	25-oct-90 (andre)
**	    pndx should not be reset for each group of 20 permits as it
**	    effectively wipes out qualifications found on permits which were
**	    found prior to the last batch of 20 or less permits (bug 33971)
**	30-nov-90 (andre)
**	    changed interface to accept a pointer to an "error rngvar" instead
**	    of the "mask".  error rngvar will be non-NULL if weare checking
**	    permissions on a table other than the one from which the user was
**	    trying to retrieve data (this would occur if an SQL user tried to
**	    retrieve from an index owned by another user, and psy_protect()
**	    decided that we should use permissions granted on the index's base
**	    table to determine if the retrieval is to be permitted)
**	01-21-91 (andre)
**	    if any of the permits used involved a qualification, set
**	    PSS_QUAL_IN_PERMS in sess_cb->pss_stmt_flags.
**	12-sep-91 (andre)
**	    If processing CREATE/DEFINE VIEW, add the privileges required in
**	    order to create a view to the appropriate list in
**	    sess_cb->pss_indep_objs.
**	24-sep-91 (andre)
**	    If processing CREATE PROCEDURE, add the privileges required in
**	    order to create a dbproc to the appropriate list in
**	    sess_cb->pss_indep_objs.
**	30-sep-91 (andre)
**	    elements of the list of independent objects will be allocated from
**	    the stream pointed to by sess_cb->pss_dependencies_stream.
**	08-oct-91 (andre)
**	    When reparsing dbprocs to determine if they are grantable, the lists
**	    of independent object and column-specific privileges will be broken
**	    into sublists by the means of list header elements.
**
**	    A sublist can  be terminated with a list_header element or with NULL
**	    (the last sublist only).  A sublist currently under construction
**	    will have no header element.  If the dbproc was reparsed
**	    successfully, the sublist will be prefixed with a PSQ_DBPLIST_HEADER
**	    element which will also contain the id of the dbproc.  If parsing a
**	    dbproc resulted in an error, a partially completed sublist will be
**	    prefixed with a PSQ_INFOLIST_HEADER element.
**
**	    While the information collected in this latter case will not be used
**	    for creating a list of independent objects in IIPRIV, it may help us
**	    to avoid scans of IIPROTECT to collect information which has already
**	    been obtained.  Besides, the memory stream used for allocation of
**	    independent object list elements will remain open until the GRANT
**	    statement is parsed, so deleting entries of the sublist from the
**	    list will serve no purpose other than losing potentially useful
**	    info.
**	    
**	    Of special interest is the fact that sublists prefixed with
**	    PSQ_INFOLIST_HEADER elements will contain not only information about
**	    privileges which the current user posesses, but also the privileges
**	    which the current user does NOT posess, thus enabling us to advise
**	    the user that he lacks the necessary privileges without consulting
**	    IIPROTECT.
**
**	    I believe that being able to determine if the user posesses the
**	    required privileges without scanning IIPROTECT will help offset the
**	    extra expense involved in building the lists of independent objects
**	    ("aha", you may say, "wouldn't it be even cheaper to not build the
**	    lists at all?".  The answer is that we will avoid adding elements to
**	    the independent object lists whenever possible (i.e. if IIPROCEDURE
**	    indicates that a dbproc is grantable or if a list in IIPRIV already
**	    exists; unfortunately, neither of these is currently implemented, so
**	    for the time being we always take the more expensive route)
**	    but in some cases we need to determine if the dbproc is grantable
**	    and insert the dependency information into IIPRIV to facilitate the
**	    process of determining if permit(s) on a dbproc has become abandoned
**	    (coinsidently having this information will spare us the expense of 
**	    going through the reparsing process when a permit on one of the
**	    dbprocs which were reparsed is created.)
**	10-mar-93 (andre)
**	    if we discover that a user lacks UPDATE on some attributes in the
**	    FOR UPDATE clause of SQL DECLARE CURSOR, then rather than report an
**	    error, we will reset pst_rsupdt in the RESDOM nodes corresponding to
**	    these attributes which will let psl_crsopen() know that a user lacks
**	    UPDATE privilege on these attributes so that any future attempt to
**	    UPDATE any of them through the cursor would be thwarted
**	02-apr-93 (andre)
**	    if qmode is PSQ_RETRIEVE or PSQ_REPCURS, we are not interested in
**	    checking permits on attributes corresponding to resdom numbers (in
**	    the former case, because they are just an ordered list and do not
**	    necessarily correspond to attribute numbers and in the latter -
**	    because we checked for UPDATE privilege on columns in the FOR UPDATE
**	    list at DECLARE CURSOR time and there is no good reason to do it all
**	    over again)
**	27-nov-02 (inkdo01)
**	    Range table expansion.

/*{
** Name: applypq	- Make minimized Boolean expr. of protection quals
**
** Description:
**	Qmap contains the bit-maps indicating which quals apply toward each
**	operation (update, retrieve, qualify, or aggregate) active in the query.
**	Pqual contains the protection qualifications.
**
**	The basic algorithm is:
**		1. For each active operation for which there is a non-null
**		   qmap, form the disjunction of all referenced pquals, being
**		   careful to create duplicates of any pquals referenced more
**		   than once.
**		2. Form the conjunction of all such qmap qualifications.
**		3. Conjoin this result to the original query tree.
**	
**	However, this can produce considerable redundancy in the resultant
**	Boolean expression.  For example, let A, B, C, ... represent pquals.
**	Given the following bit-map:
**
**			    pquals
**			    A   B   C   D
**		qmap[0] U   1   1   1
**		qmap[1] R   1   1       1
**		qmap[2] A
**		qmap[3] Q   1   1   1 
**
**	the simple algorithm would produce:
**		(A or B or C) and (A or B or D) and (A or B or C)
**	which could be simplified to:
**		A or B or (C and D)
**
**	Therefore we modify the algorithm to produce a minimized expression as
**	follows:
**	    (Algorithm PQ)
**		1. Form bit-wise AND of all (non-zero) qmaps into gormap
**		("global-OR-map").  Each bit in gormap represents a pqual that
**		can be factored out and OR'd globally with the remaining
**		resultant conjunctive expression.  If there are any active
**		all-zero qmaps we can return (NULL) immediately since we can
**		show that the remaining qualification must be logically
**		redundant (exercise for the reader).  (This check need not be
**		done first time called, as all active qmaps will be non-zero.)
**		2. If gormap is non-zero, disjoin all gormap pquals to form
**		QUAL, checking for pqual duplication.
**		3. Mask out all gormap bits from all qmaps.
**		4. Recursively generate remaining protection qual, and if
**		non-null DISJOIN it to QUAL.
**		5. Else pick one of the qmaps to eliminate, call it Z.  (We
**		can use some algorithm to pick the "best" one -- e.g., the one
**		such that the gormap of the remaining qmaps would contain the
**		most pquals.)
**		6. Disjoin all pquals in Z, forming QUAL, checking for pqual
**		duplication, and marking Z as inactive.
**		7. Recursively generate remaining protection qual based on
**		rest of qmaps and if non-null CONJOIN it to Z.
**		8. Return QUAL.
**
** Inputs:
**	size				Size of qualification map
**	qmap				The qualification map
**	pqual				Qualification list
**	checkany			TRUE means check for any all-zero maps
**	outtree				Pointer to place to put pointer to
**					qualification tree
**	dup_rb				ptr to request block used by pst_treedup
**					conveniently, it contains memory stream
**					and error block ptrs (among other
**					things). Other fields have been preset
**					to be passed to gorform(), and, if
**					necesasary, to pst_treedup().
**	    pss_mstream			memory stream
**	    pss_err_blk			error block.
**
** Outputs:
**      outtree                         Filled in with pointer to qualification
**					tree
**	dup_rb->
**	    pss_err_blk			Filled in if an error happens
**	Returns:
**	    E_DB_OK			Success
**	    E_DB_ERROR			Failure
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	    Can allocate memory
**
** History:
**	24-jun-86 (jeff)
**	    Adapted from applypq() in 4.0
**	14-sep-89 (andre)
**	    changed interface (slightly.)  ptrs to memory stream and error block
**	    are passed inside the request block to be passed to gorform() for

/*{
** Name: makedset	- Make domain reference sets
**
** Description:
**	This routine creates some sets which reflect the usage of
**	domains for a particular variable.
**
**	The interesting nodes are 'case' labels in the large
**	switch statement which comprises most of the code.  To
**	describe briefly:
**
**	VAR nodes are easy: if they are for the current variable,
**		set the bit corresponding to the domain in the
**		'retrieval' set.  They can have no descendents,
**		so just return.
**	RESDOM nodes are also easy: they can be handled the same,
**		but the bit is set in the 'update' set instead.
**	AGHEAD nodes signal the beginning of an aggregate or
**		aggregate function.  In this case, we scan the
**		qualification first (noting that RESDOM and VAR
**		nodes are processed as 'qualification' sets
**		instead of 'retrieval' or 'update' sets).  Then,
**		if the aggregate has a WHERE clause or a BY list,
**		we treat it as a retrieve; otherwise, we call our-
**		selves recursively treating VAR nodes as 'aggregate'
**		types rather than 'retrieve' types.
**	BYHEAD nodes signal the beginning of a BY list.  The left
**		subtree (the actual BY-list) is processed with
**		RESDOM nodes ignored (since they are pseudo-domains
**		anyhow) and VAR nodes mapped into the 'qualification'
**		set.  Then we check the right subtree (which better
**		begin with an AOP node!) and continue processing.
**	AOP nodes must have a null left subtree, so we just drop
**		to the right subtree and iterate.  Notice that we
**		do NOT map VAR nodes into the 'aggregate' set for
**		this node, since this has already been done by the
**		AGHEAD node; also, this aggregate might be counted
**		as a retrieve operation instead of an aggregate
**		operation (as far as the protection system is con-
**		cerned) -- this has been handled by the AGHEAD
**		node.
**	All other nodes are processed recursively along both edges.
**
** Inputs:
**      var                             The range variable we are currently
**					interested in.
**	tree				The root of the tree to scan.  Notice
**					that this will in general only be one
**					half of the tree -- makedset will be
**					called once for the target list and 
**					once for the qualification, with
**					different sets for the following
**					parameters
**	query_mode			real query mode
**	qmode				Query mode we are getting permission

**	retrtoall			TRUE means "retrieve to all" permission
**					was given
**	sess_cb				Pointer to session control block
**	rngtab				Pointer to range table
**	uset				Current update set
**	rset				Current retrieve set
**	aset				Current aggregate set
**	qset				Current qualification set
**	rdf_cb				to read protection tuples
**	rdf_tree_cb			to read tree tuples
**	dup_rb				ptr to a request block for use by

**	aset				Adjusted to be the set of all domains
**					aggregated.  Notice that this set is
**					not adjusted explicitly, but rather is
**					passed to recursive incarnations of this
**					routine as 'rset'
**	qset				Adjusted to be the set of domains
**					retrieved implicitly in a qualification.

**	    when building a map of attributes in the FOR UPDATE clause of
**	    DECLARE CURSOR, it is incorrect to use resdom number since it is
**	    always set to 1.  Instead, we must use the attribute number
**	    contained in the VAR node attached to the RESDOM node.  If a node
**	    other than VAR node is atached to the RESDOM node, we will simply
**	    skip the node, since that column will most definitely not be

/*{
** Name: prochk	- Query-dependent protection tuple check
**
** Description:
**	This routine does the query-dependent part of checking
**	the validity of a protection tuple.  Unlike proappl,
**	which looked at aspects of the environment but not the
**	query being run, this routine assumes that the environ-
**	ment is ok, and checks that if it applies to this tuple.
**
**	Two things are checked.  The first is if this tuple applies
**	to the operation in question (passed as privs).  The
**	second is if the set of domains in the tuple contains the
**	set of domains in the query (applies only when dealing with table
**	privileges, i.e. SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE.)  If either of these
**	fail, the return is zero.  Otherwise the return is the operation
**	bit.  Note that privs contained DB_GRANT_OPTION bit, we will ensure that
**	the tuple specifies WGO, but will only return the actual operation
**
**	If checking for table privileges, the domain set is checked for all
**	zero.  If so, no domains have been referenced for this 
**	operation at all, and we return zero.  In other words, this
**	tuple might apply to this operation, but since we don't
**	use the operation anyhow we will ignore it.  It is important
**	to handle things in this way so that the qualification for
**	this tuple doesn't get appended if the variable is not
**	used in a particular context.
**
** Inputs:
**      privs				Map representing required privilege(s).
**					More than one operation may be checked
**					for (may happen with GRANT).
**					DB_GRANT_OPTION bit, if set, indicates
**					that the privilege(s) must be grantable.
**
**	domset				The set of domains actually referenced
**					in this query for the operation
**					described by "privs".  When checking for
**					privileges other than SELECT, INSERT,
**					DELETE, or UPDATE, this will be set to
**					NULL
**					
**	protup				The tuple in question.
**
** Outputs:
**	Returns:
**	    The operation (if any) to which this tuple applies.
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
**	domset				For REPLACE (update) or REFERENCES
**					priv, domset is updated to clear the
**					bits for all columns that this tuple
**					permits.  QUEL does not support column
**					specific update permits, so for QUEL
**					all columns in domset are cleared.
**
** Side Effects:
**	    none
**
** History:
**      07-jul-86 (jeff)
**          Adapted from prochk() in 4.0
**	21-sep-90 (andre)
**	    domain set passed by the caller has a size =  sizeof(PSY_ATTMAP)
**	    which is the minimum number of i2's required to represent
**	    DB_MAX_COLS+1 columns.  Domain set as found in IIPROTECT tuple
**	    consists of a minimum number of i4's required to represent
**	    DB_MAX_COLS+1 columns.  As a result the size of the former is
**	    guaranteed to be <= the size of the latter, so it makes sense to use
**	    the size of the former when determining if we are done scanning the
**	    domain maps.
**	26-jul-91 (andre)
**	    prochk may be given a mask specifying more than one operation;
**	    the mask will be of type i4, to match dbp_popset.  If the
**	    DB_GRANT_OPTION bit is set, we need to ascertain that the permit
**	    tuple specified GRANT OPTION along with at least one of desired
**	    operations.
**	06-aug-91 (andre)
**	    PSY_ATTMAP now consists of DB_COL_WORDS i4's so the (21-sep-90)
**	    comment about difference in sizes is no longer relevant
**	29-jan-92 (andre)
**	    when  processing SQL queries, UPDATE(c1), ..., UPDATE(cn) is
**	    equivalent to UPDATE(c1, ..., cn).  Therefore, we will no longer
**	    insist that the tuple's attribute map be a superset of domset;
**	    instead we will replace domset with a set difference of domset and
**	    the tuple's attribute map.  If domset becomes empty, we will notify
**	    caller that the user posesses UPDATE; otherwise domset will
**	    represent attributes on which UPDATE privilege must still be
**	    satisfied
**	10-feb-92 (andre)
**	    adapt prochk() for checking permits for objects other than tables
**	    (e.g. dbevents).  Mainly this involves skipping all attribute map
**	    checks when dealing with non-table objects
**	09-jun-92 (andre)
**	    DB_TEST and DB_AGGREGATE may have attribute maps associated with
**	    them
**	10-dec-92 (andre)
**	    as a part of adding support for REFERENCES privilege, we will be
**	    handling permits specifying REFERENCES in the same manner as permits
**	    specifying UPDATE, i.e. when  processing GRANT, REFERENCES(c1), ...,
**	    REFERENCES(cn) is equivalent to REFERENCES(c1, ..., cn).  Therefore,
**	    we will not insist that the tuple's attribute map be a superset of
**	    domset; instead we will replace domset with a set difference of
**	    domset and the tuple's attribute map.  If domset becomes empty, we
**	    will notify caller that the user posesses REFERENCES on the desired
**	    set of attributes; otherwise domset will represent attributes on
**	    which REFERENCES privilege must still be satisfied
**	11-oct-1993 (tad)
**	    Bug #56449
**	    Changed %x to %p for pointer values.
**	4-Aug-2004 (schka24)
**	    Update the REPLACE or REFERENCES bitmap for quel as well as sql.
**	    This change was to have been made with my 20-Jul changes to
**	    check-permits, but I forgot.  Duh.

**
** History:
**      24-jul-91 (andre)
**	    extracted from dopro()
**	26-jul-91 (andre)
**	    privs can involve more than one of "update" operations
**	    (UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT).
**
**	    NOTE: this will work correctly in SQL only.  If there is a chance
**	    that we are looking for more than one type of "update" privilege, we
**	    would have to define separate qual maps for each of
**	    "update operations" since otherwise we may incorrectly stop looking
**	    for unqualified permits.  I do not expect that this (looking for
**	    multiple "update" privileges in QUEL) will ever happen, though.
**
**	    "update" privs and DB_RETRIEVE may be requested WGO
**	25-sep-91 (andre)
**	    if parsing a dbproc and it still appears to be grantable, check if
**	    the required privileges are available WGO - if not, the dbproc being
**	    parsed is non-grantable
**	11-nov-91 (rblumer)
**	  merged from 6.4:  26-feb-91 (andre)
**	    PST_QTREE was changed to store the range table as an array of
**	    pointers to PST_RNGENTRY structure.
**	18-mar-92 (andre)
**	    forgot to copy join maps from permit tree range entry to the new
**	    range table entry when merging permit tree into the query tree
**	03-aug-92 (barbara)
**	    Set rdr_tabid and rdr_sequence when requesting permit tree from
**	    RDF.
**	29-sep-92 (andre)
**	    RDF may choose to allocate a new info block and return its address
**	    in rdf_info_blk - we need to copy it over to pss_rdrinfo to avoid
**	    memory leak and other assorted unpleasantries
**	14-dec-92 (walt)
**	    Replaced \T with \t in a TRdisplay format to silence a compiler
**	    warning about illegal display formats on Alpha.
**	10-Feb-93 (Teresa)
**	    Changed RDF_GETINFO to RDF_READTUPLES for new RDF I/F
**	01-apr-93 (andre)
**	    (fix for bugs 50823 & 50825)
**	    if processing declaration of a QUEL cursor on the current table (or
**	    a view defined over the current table), we will try to determine
**	    whether the user possesses unconditional permits on all of its
**	    attributes.  Knowing this fact will enable us to avoid going through
**	    view/permit processing if cursor was defined over a table and permit
**	    processing if it was defined over a view
**	02-apr-93 (andre)
**	    (fix for bugs 50823 & 50825)
**	    we could be called in the course of processing REPLACE CURSOR to
**	    verify that the user possesses RETRIEVE on all columns appearing
**	    on the RHS of the assignments; in that case we are not interested
**	    in conditional permits either.
**	23-May-1997 (shero03)
**	    Save the rdf_info_blk after an UNFIX
**	02-Jun-1997 (shero03)
**	    Update the pss_rdrinfo pointer after calling rdf
**      14-May-1999 (carsu07)
**          The function psy_check_permits scans through 20 permits at a time
**          unless the WGO was set. Part of checking this permission involves
**          checking if the definition is of a dbproc which appears to be
**          grantable so far has WGO.  However if you're not using dbprocs, then
**          the if statement fails and privs_wgo is set.
**          This in turn means no futher permissions are checked. (Bug 80064)
**	18-Mar-2004 (schka24)
**	    Random odd results caused by failure to initialize privs_wgo,
**	    which in turn was probably caused by bad indentation from last
**	    change.  Move the init, fix the indentation.
**	20-Jul-2004 (schka24)
**	    When a privilege is satisfied, but with a conditional permit,
**	    keep looking in case we discover an unconditional permit.
**	    This was the intent all along, but the code did not keep track
**	    properly.  The result was that a retrieval might or might not
**	    have (quel) permit conditions applied, depending on the order
**	    in which we happened to see the permits.
**	    Also, the update bitmap stuff was handled in an awkward manner,
**	    clean it up.
**	4-Aug-2004 (schka24)
**	    Above change messed up quel update permits, fix.
**	    Fix another bug that terminated early before satisfying requested
**	    cursor checks.  Not sure, but I think this bug predates my 20-jul
**	    fixes as well;  could cause random spurious E_US08A3.
