/**
** Name: gwmrow.c	- IMA gateway subs for row ops.
**
** Description:
**
**    This file contains functions that do row oriented operations
**    on GM opblocks.  It's distinct from the object at a time operations
**    in gwmop.c (GM_op, GM_lop, and GM_rop) because it does row
**    oriented caching.  Even that is questionable!
**
**	GM_request	-- grind row opblk request, local or remote
**
**	GM_lrequest 	-- Handle a local row request using MO.
**	GM_rrequest	-- Handle a local row request using GCM.
**
** History:
**	19-feb-91 (daveb/bryanp)
**	    Modified from gwftest/gwflgtst.c for proof of concept.
**	6-Nov-91 (daveb)
**	    Modified from gwf_mi_works.c to gwf_mo.c now that MI
**	    has mutated.
**	15-Jan-92 (daveB)
**	    Much modified from above.
**	16-Sep-92 (daveb)
**		Make sure to set db_stat on NO_NEXT cl_stat.
**	9-oct-92 (daveb)
**		broke into gwmxtab.c and gwmxutil.c
**	13-Nov-1992 (daveb)
**	    simply GM_ad_to_tuple by using new GM_scanresp to scan
**	    GETRESP block.  Fix local_request: perms are a i4, not
**	    a string in the getresp block.
**	14-Nov-1992 (daveb)
**	    In GXrequest, take 0 length place as this server too.
**	17-Nov-1992 (daveb)
**	    move GX_next_place inline to GXget
**	19-Nov-1992 (daveb)
**	    include <gca.h> now that we're using GCA_FS_MAX_DATA for the
**	    OPBLK buffer size.
**	19-Nov-1992 (daveb)
**	    split into gwmxutil.c, which knows about GX_RSBs, and
**	    and gwmrow.c, which does row-oriented OPBLOCK operations.
**	24-Nov-1992 (daveb)
**	    take guises from the RSB rather than calculating them all the time.
**	1-Feb-1993 (daveb)
**	    Fix typo, update some document related stuff for accuracy.
**	    In the past, GM_request was GXrequest, GM_lrequest was
**	    GX_local_request, and GM_rrequest was GX_remote_request.
**	14-jul-93 (ed)
**	    replacing <dbms.h> by <gl.h> <sl.h> <iicommon.h> <dbdbms.h>
**	19-Aug-1993 (daveb)
**	    Positioned place wasn't working right, because it was going
**	    into the GM_GET case without an instance value.  When instance
**	    is 0 length, go into the GM_GETNEXT case to locate the first
**	    instance in the place.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**      24-Feb-2004 (kodse01)
**          Removed gwxit.h inclusion which is not required.
