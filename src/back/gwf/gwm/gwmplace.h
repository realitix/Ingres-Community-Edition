** History:
**	wherever (daveb)
**	    Created.
**	30-sep-92 (daveb)
**	    Renamed everything for 7 char uniqueness.
**	    Add GM_XTAB_VNODE and GM_XTAB_SERVER.
**	    Revise GM_ATT_ENTRY, a make pointer to an
**	    array of them part of the GM_RSB.
**	9-oct-92 (daveb)
**	    broke out of gwmint.h
**	11-Nov-1992 (daveb)
**	    Remove ifdef for GCA_FS_MAX_DATA -- it better be there now.
**	    Change conn_request/response to conn_rsb.
**	25-Nov-1992 (daveb)
**	    Add cursor for distributing vnode requests among
**	    installation capable servers.
**      24-jul-97 (stial01)
**          II_GM_CONN_BLK: Added conn_buffer_size, made conn_buffer a ptr.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main

** Name:	GM_VNODE_BLK - entry for a vnode.
**
** Description:
**
**	Node in the GM_PLACES gwm_places tree.
**
**	One of these for each vnode that GM knows about.
**	It contains a pointer to a tree that contains
**	all accessible servers known in that vnode.
**
**	Key is the vnode name in the user domain, stashed
**	somewhere safe.  Comparision is STcompare.
**
**	The servers are to be queried each time we access
**	a new vnode, with maybe a timelimit.
**
**	To insert, gwm_places_sem must be held:
**
**		get gwm_places_sem;
**		if( not already in gwm_places )
**		{
**			v = allocate( sizeof *v );
**			init(v);
**			insert( &v->vnode_blk, gwm_places );
**		}
**		release gwm_places_sem;
**
**	You don't ever delete vnodes.  FIXME?

/*}
** Name:	GM_SRVR_BLK - entry for a server.
**
** Description:
**
**	part of node in the GM_PLACES tree.
**
**	One of these for each server known to GM
**	in a vnode.  Key is the place of the server,
**	stashed in a safe place.  Comparison is by STcompare.
**      It is a string of the form vnode::/@gca_address.  Neither
**      the place nor the gca_address part is optional, and there 
**      may be no dbname part from a general GCA address.  The GCN
**	is addressed as "/iinmsrvr".
**
**	We keep a count of the number of outstanding
**	connection/requests to the server, and block
**	using a condition until it's OK.
**
**	The place_semaphore must be held when writing srvr_connects.
**	The gwm_places_sem should not be held when modifying connects,
**	or waiting on a condition for connects.
**
**	For deletion, gwm_places_sem and place_sem must be held.  You should 
**	never delete a server with active connections.
**
**	Note that you should never be deleting a server with a connection!
