** Name: GWFINT.H - gateway internal/private interface.
**
** Description:
**	This file contains the definition of gateway internal interfaces which
**	are private to GWF.
**
** History:
**      21-Apr-1989 (alexh)
**          Created for Gateway project.
**	24-dec-89 (paul)
**	    Several updates over several days to make data structures match the
**	    code.
**	5-apr-90 (bryanp)
**	    Added improved support for memory configuration.
**	9-apr-90 (bryanp)
**	    Added gwf_gw_active and gwf_gw_xacts to support new gwf_call()
**	    interface. These fields are set at init time, and may be queried by

**	8-may-90 (alan)
**	    Added 'gws_username' to GW_SESSION structure.
**	19-sep-90 (linda)
**	    Cleaned up structure member names.  Specifically, made every
**	    structure member have a tag prepended; e.g. the GW_ATT_ENTRY
**	    structure members now all start with "gwat_".

**          Add xrcb_gchdr_size to GWX_RCB.
**      23-jun-99 (chash01)  integrate changes
**        13-jun-96 (schang)
**          6.4 change integration into oping1.x
**          add GWX_VSINIT definition; change xrcb_xhandle to *xrcb_xhandle,
**          and add xrcb_xbitset field in gwx_rcb.

** Name: GWX_RCB - GW Request control structure
**
** Description:
**	This structure is used for requesting service from the GWF exit.  The
**	structure should not be used to store permanent information.
**
** History:
**      26-Apr-1989 (alexh)
**          Created for Gateway project.
**	23-dec-89 (paul)
**	    Added ability to pass the RSB and TCB for the gateway object to the
**	    gateway exits. All the information in these structures may be
**	    required to run the gateway. In addition, the gateway needs to
**	    attach its own structures onto these 'generic' structures.
**	28-mar-90 (bryanp)
**	    New fields xrcb_dmf_cptr, xrcb_database_id, and xrcb_xact_id added
**	    to the GWX_RCB for use by the DMF gateway.
**	08-jun-90 (linda)
**	    Add xrcb_page_cnt field to return back the "page" count for the
**	    file.  For RMS this is the number of VMS blocks.  This number is
**	    not adjusted to represent Ingres pages because:  (1) I/O is done on
**	    a record basis, not block I/O, so there will be more I/O's anyway;
**	    (2) ingres pages are irrelevant even if we were doing block I/O;
**	    (3) it isn't particularly accurate anyway re: the actual amount of
**	    data in the file, since if the file is keyed there is space taken
**	    for those and in any case the amount of space allocated to the file
**	    does not represent the amount of space actually used.  Better to
**	    overestimate than to underestimate.  This information is only used
**	    by the optimizer.  May want to adjust at a later date.
**	30-sep-92 (robf)
**	    Added data4 value so table info can be passed in during the
**	    REGISTER operation.
**      18-sep-92 (schang)
**          add xrcb_xhandle in GWX_RCB to support server wide data inside a
**          specific gateway
**      24-jul-97 (stial01)
**          Add xrcb_gchdr_size to GWX_RCB.
**	12-Oct-2010 (kschendel) SIR 124544
**	    Replace "data4" with dmu characteristics.

/*}
** Name: GW_TCB - Gateway table strucuture
**
** Description:
**	This structure contains all information needed for a gateway table.
**	Since some of the information requires look up in the extended
**	catalogs, a list of gatway tcb's are cached at GW facility level, i.e.
**	sharable by all GWF sessions. When a table is opened for a session,
**	cached tcb list is searched for. If not found, a new tcb is created and
**	initialized with info read from extended catalog and added to the tcb
**	cache. The "internal_tcb" is optional and private to a specific
**	gateway.
**
**	There are several interesting points to make.
**
**	1.  There is a race condition where two users may decide to create a
**	    TCB for the same table. We allow this to happen since the TCB's are
**	    read-only, having several should not be an issue. It is important
**	    that gwt_remove and gwi_remove make sure to remove all TCB's
**	    corresponding to a specific table.
**
**  THE TROUBLE WITH THIS IS THAT WE USE gwt_use_count TO TELL HOW MANY USERS
**  ARE CURRENTLY ACCESSING A TABLE, AND WE DO DELTE TCB'S ON TABLE CLOSE TO
**  AVOID GROWING MEMORY INDEFINITELY.  THE CALLER IN THIS CASE (GWT_CLOSE)
**  KNOWS WHICH TCB IT HAS; HOWEVER, GWU_DELTCB SEARCHES THROUGH THE LIST FOR
**  ANY TCB WITH THE SAME TABLE ID; IF THAT ONE HAS A gwt_use_count OF > 0, IT
**  EMITS AN ERROR.
**
**	2.  We should not have to worry about a table being removed while it is
**	    still being referenced by another session. The INGRES concurrency
**	    mechanism should handle this correctly.
**
**	3.  The TCB list may only be accessed while it is protected by a
**	    semaphore. The list must be locked exclusively whenever an entry is
**	    being added or deleted. The list must be locked shared whenever it
**	    is being searched. If the desired TCB is found, its use_count must
**	    be incremented before the shared lock on the TCB list is removed.
**
**	4. TCB's and their affiliated gateway extended TCB's are allocated from
**	    their own ULM memory stream. The streams identifier is maintained
**	    in the TCB. The TCB may be deallocated by simply closing this
**	    stream.
**	    
** History:
**      24-Apr-1989 (alexh)
**          Created for Gateway project.
**	26-dec-89 (paul)
**	    Updated TCB to handle internal tcb allocation.
**	5-apr-90 (bryanp)
**	    Added tcb_memleft field to fully support GW_TCB's in their own
**	    memory streams.
**	06-oct-93 (swm)
**	    Bug #56443
**	    Change type of gwt_db_id from i4 to PTR for consistency
**	    with gwr_database_id which has now also changed to PTR.

** Name: GW_SESSION - GW session control structure
**
** Description:
**	This structure contains information for a GW session. The address of a
**	session structure is the GW session id. All data manipulations can only
**	be requested after a session is established.
**
** History:
**      24-Apr-1989 (alexh)
**          Created for Gateway project.
**	26-dec-89 (paul)
**	    Added a pointer to the ADF_CB so we can do data conversions.
**	8-may-90 (alan)
**	    Added 'gws_username' to GW_SESSION structure.
**	30-apr-1991 (rickh)
**		Removed definition of tidjoin bit.
**	14-sep-92 (robf)
**	     Added per-session tracing.
**      12-apr-93 (schang)
**          add     bool        gws_interrupted;
**	04-jun-93 (ralph)
**	    DELIM_IDENT:
**	    Added GW_SESSION.gws_gw_info array, GW_SESSION.gws_dbxlate and
**	    GW_SESSION.gws_cat_owner to contain session-specific information
**	    with respect to case translation semantics.
**	14-Apr-2008 (kschendel)
**	    Add adfcb / error-code pointers to be set during calls to
**	    a row qualifier function, as arithmetic exceptions during a
**	    qualification call are OK and must be handled.  (since we don't
**	    switch to qef context to call the qualifier any more.)

/*
** Name: GWF memory defaults
**
** Description:
**
** Default memory sizes. GWF uses these values to size its memory limits
** to 'reasonable' values.
**	GWF_FACMEM_DEFAULT	- GWF facility basic memory overhead. This is
**				  the memory to be used for GW_TCB's and other
**				  items which are not user-specific.
**	GWF_SESMEM_DEFAULT	- GWF per-user memory limit. This is the max
**				  amount of GWF memory which any one user can
**				  acquire.
**	GWF_TCBMEM_DEFAULT	- GWF per-table memory limit. This is the max
**				  amount of GWF memory which any one GW_TCB can
**				  acquire.
**
** Note that the total GWF memory usage is set (by gwf_def_pool_size()) to:
**	GWF_FACMEM_DEFAULT + (num_users * GWF_SESMEM_DEFAULT)
**
** Note also that the GW_FACILITY structure is allocated directly from SCF
** server-wide memory and so does not enter into this discussion.
**
** These values are used as defaults. Eventually, we plan to provide a set of
** server startup parameters which will allow these values to be configured for
** particular servers.
**
** History:
**	3-apr-90 (bryanp)
**	    Created and set to preliminary values.
