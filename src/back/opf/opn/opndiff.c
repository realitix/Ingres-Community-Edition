/*{
** Name: opn_chardiff - compute difference between two characters
**
** Description:
**	This function returns an integer number representing the
**	difference between two characters, known as the "character diff",
**	which is a measure of the number of unique characters between
**	the two characters. It computes the diff in the context of a
**	particular character position of particular column, using character
**	set information from the column's histogram, namely the number of
**	unique characters in the character position these characters came
**	from, and the character set "density" for the character position.The
**	character set density is a measure of how complete the character set
**	in the character position is, stored as a floating point number
**	between 0 and 1: a density of 1.0 indicates a complete character set,
**	given the number of unique characters; lower densities indicate
**	sparser character sets. These statistics (nunique and density) are
**	compiled by optimizedb and stored in the histogram for the column, or,
**	if there is no histogram, default statistics are used.
**
**	You can see that the character diff is more than just subtracting one
**	character from another.	See the Character Histogram Enhancements spec
**	for details on the algorithm (see algorithm for CharDiff).
**
**	Called from: opn_stringdiff()
**	
** Inputs:
**	high			First character
**	low			Second character
**	forcemax		If 0, compute char diff. If -1, set char diff
**				to 1 - nunique. If 1, set to nunique - 1.
**	nunique			Number of unique values in this character
**				position 
**	density			Character set density for this character
**				position
**
** Outputs:
**	forcemax		Set to -1 if computed diff was less than 
**				1 - nunique. Set to 1 if diff was greater than
**				nunique - 1. Otherwise leave at 0.
**	Returns:
**	    OPN_DIFF measure of the character diff.
**	Exceptions:
**	    None.
**
** Side Effects:
**	    none
**
** History:
**	09-nov-92 (rganski)
**          Initial creation.
**	26-apr-93 (rganski)
**	    Changed return type to OPN_DIFF, which gives more accuracy.
**	    If the two characters are different and diff is less than nunique -
**	    1 in magnitude, disallows return values between -1.0 and 1.0 (i.e.
**	    fractions): there must be a difference of at least one, or the
**	    chardiff can cause the magnitude of the string diff to decrease.
**	27-jul-98 (hayke02)
**	    Round up/down chardiff when comparing with nunique. This
**	    prevents forcemax being erroneously set when chardiff contains
**	    rubbish from the f4/f8 calculation (e.g. -25.00000108778477
**	    instead of -25.0). This change fixes bug 91163.
**      01-Jan-00 (sarjo01)
**          Bug 99120: Added new parameter tbl so collation sequence
**          can be used by opn_diff where applicable.
**	28-may-03 (inkdo01)
**	    Fold highchar/lowchar below 0x80 on assumption that only 
**	    alternate collations have chars above 0x80. This keeps the lid
**	    on diff values and addresses bug 109507.

**          Initial creation.
**	14-dec-92 (rganski)
**	    Phase 3 of Character Histogram Enhancements project.
**	    See spec for full discussion of the changes.
**	    Bumped up multiplier in stopping condition from 100 to
**	    200.
**	    Added datatype parameter: diffs computed for join
**	    cardinalities may be done in the context of a histogram
**	    whose datatype has been converted to the type of the
**	    other column in the join; in this case the datatype
**	    information in attrp is incorrect.
**	18-jan-93 (rganski)
**	    Moved prevdiff local to outermost level and initialized to 0.
**	    Otherwise there is a remote possibility it will be used before
**	    initialization.
**	26-apr-93 (rganski)
**	    Changed return type of opn_chardiff() to OPN_DIFF, for more
**	    accuracy.
**	    Changed stopping condition: if previous diff was 0, continue
**	    (otherwise returns a diff of 0).
**	28-jun-93 (rganski)
**	    Added typecast for parameter to MHceil.
**	20-sep-93 (rganski)
**	    Added check of new oph_version field of OPH_INTERVAL. Adjustment of
**	    diff for 6.4 and previous histograms only done if there is no
**	    version.
**      01-Jan-00 (sarjo01)
**          Bug 99120: Added new parameter tbl so collation sequence
**          can be used by opn_diff where applicable.
**	28-may-03 (inkdo01)
**	    When checking difference accuracy, compare to "abs(diff)". It is
**	    just the magnitude that matters and alternate collations can 
**	    generate negative diffs that then produce very large numbers,
**	    sometimes resulting in bug 109507.
**	10-feb-04 (hayke02)
**	    Modify the above change so that abs(diff) is replaced with diff ||
**	    (diff * -1.0). abs() expects an integer, but diff is an f8, and so
**	    abs(diff) will return incorrect results when diff > max(i4). This
**	    change fixes problem INGSRV 2702, bug 111759.
**	13-oct-05 (inkdo01)
**	    Add heuristic to return diff of 1 when it appears low is a marker
**	    for high.
**	25-nov-05 (inkdo01)
**	    Minor fix to above to increment pos before assignment to 
**	    *charlength, making up for quick exit of big loop.
**	17-Apr-07 (kibro01) b118015
**	    Ensure that if we're using collation sequences and we get into a
**	    forcemax situation (an odd character like an accent in the string
**	    causes this), we keep the diff value growing so we can break out
**	    of the loop at a reasonable sdifflength value, thus avoiding
**	    numeric overflows elsewhere (oph_splitcell, for example).

**	celltups		    For character types only:
**				    Number of tuples in the histogram cell. This
**				    is only used if charlength is 0 or less. We
**				    assume that the strings are the boundary
**				    values of a histogram cell with this many
**				    (celltups) tuples, and we use celltups to
**				    determine when we have gone far enough in our
**				    string diff computation.
**      attrp			    Ptr to joinop attribute which is context
**				    for this diff. 
**	   .opz_histogram	    Interval, datatype, and character set
**				    information associated with this attribute.
**		.oph_dataval	    Data type information for histogram and
**				    high and low parameters.
**	   	.oph_charnunique
**	   	.oph_chardensity    Character set statistics for this
**				    attribute, if character type
**
** Outputs:
**	charlength		For character types only: length to which
**				string diff computation went.
**				If this was greater than 0 on input, it
**				will be unchanged.
**	Returns:
**	    OPN_DIFF (f8) measure of how different the parameter are.
**	Exceptions:
**	    there may be some floating point exceptions in this routine
**          FIXME - need to do something so cannot get underflow when
**          subtracting two floats??
**
** Side Effects:
**	    none
**
** History:
**	25-may-86 (seputis)
**          initial creation
**      14-jan-87 (seputis)
**          all string histogram datatypes are now mapped into DB_CHA_TYPE
**      27-may-89 (seputis)
**	    use unsigned arithmetic for comparing character strings - CLSI bug
**	03-feb-92 (rganski)
**	    When computing diff for DB_CHA_TYPE, set char difference to
**	    -9 instead of -10 if diff so far is 1. This allows the diff
**	    to increase through multiplication.
**	09-nov-92 (rganski)
**	    Replace code for string diffs (char types) with call to new
**	    function opn_stringdiff(), which implements new string diff
**	    functionality for long strings, for Character Histogram
**	    Enhancements project. Added 3 new parameters: charlength,
**	    celltups, and attrp, which are needed by opn_stringdiff(),
**	    and removed datatype parameter, since this can be gotten from
**	    attrp.
**	14-dec-92 (rganski)
**	    Phase 3 of Character Histogram Enhancements project.
**	    Added datatype parameter: diffs computed for join
**	    cardinalities may be done in the context of a histogram
**	    whose datatype has been converted to the type of the
**	    other column in the join; in this case the datatype
**	    information in attrp is incorrect.
**	26-apr-93 (rganski)
**	    Added charlength to description of output parameters above. No code
**	    changes.
**	18-Jun-1999 (schte01)
**       Added casts and casted assigns to avoid unaligned access in axp_osf.   
**      01-Jan-00 (sarjo01)
**          Bug 99120: Added new parameter tbl so collation sequence
**          can be used by opn_diff where applicable.
**	18-Jun-1999 (schte01)
**       Added casts and casted assigns to avoid unaligned access in axp_osf.   
**	31-mar-05 (inkdo01)
**	    Some moron (a.k.a. inkdo01) forgot to add the i8 case to opn_diff
**	    when bigint's were implemented.
**	03-Oct-2008 (kiria01) b120966
**	    Added DB_BYTE_TYPE support to allow for Unicode CE entries
**	    to be treated as raw collation data alongside DB_CHA_TYPE.
