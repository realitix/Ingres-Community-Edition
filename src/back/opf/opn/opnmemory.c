/**
**
**  Name: OPNMEMORY.C - allocate some enumeration memory
**
**  Description:
**      routine to allocate enumeration memory
**      FIXME - routines to do garbage collection are mostly concerned
**      with CO trees; since these lists get pretty long.  The following
**      strategy should be implemented.
**      PHASE I)  This phase attempts to do intelligent garbage collection
**      and avoid regeneration of intermediate CO trees.
**      If memory is exhausted then a traversal of the savesubtree structs
**      should be made and any cotrees (and related structures) which
**      are greater than the minimum cost tree should be deleted. (currently
**      all structures are deleted, except the minumum cost tree and current
**      tree being worked on).  By taking advantage of the enumeration order
**      if a search of the subtrees fails it is because the cost of the subtree
**      exceeded the minimum cost tree (if indexes in the current tree being
**      worked on are not all included) since it must have been generated and
**      deleted.
**      Fix the dangling pointer problem for histograms in OPN_RLS structs.
**      Also delete OPN_RLS and OPN_EQS structures which have had all
**      respective CO trees deleted.
**
**      PHASE II) Partial deletion of work which has been done.  Attempt
**      to delete work which has been done for (n-1) leaves where n is the
**      number of leaves currently being worked on.  Repeat this (for n-2 etc.)
**      until some
**      memory has been freed to satisfy the current request.  The hueristic
**      for searching saved work now (i.e. if it cannot be found then it is too
**      expensive) becomes limited to the subtrees which
**      have fewer leaves than those deleted.
**
**      PHASE III) This phase begins when memory is exhausted in spite of
**      intelligent garbage collection.  Find and save information about
**      the current position in the enumeration and the current best
**      minimum CO tree.  Delete the enumeration stream and recreate it.
**      Move forward in the enumeration to the point at which memory was
**      exhausted and begin.  The hueristics used in PHASE I and II cannot be
**      used now.
**
**      PHASE IV) If no progress can be made then too little memory exists
**      at this point, so exit with the best CO if it exists or report an
**      error.
**
**  History:

**          initial creation

**      the main enumeration stream.  This will also enumeration to continue
**      processing from the proper point in the search space.

/*{
** Name: opn_memory	- allocate enumeration memory
**
** Description:
**      This routine will allocate memory from the enumeration stream which
**      will be available for the duration of the enumeration of one subquery.
**      All memory will be deallocated after the best co tree has been copied
**      from the enumeration memory space, to the optimization memory space.
**      This distinction is made since the enumeration memory space tends to
**      grow quite large and will be "reused" by successive enumerations.
**
** Inputs:
**      global                          ptr to global state variable
**      size                            size of memory space to allocate
**
** Outputs:
**	Returns:
**	    PTR to memory space with "size" bytes allocated - aligned for
**          all data types.
**	Exceptions:
**	    (EX)EX_JNP_LJMP is generated if an error is received from ULM
**          - the exception handler in OPN_CEVAL should catch this error
**          and attempt to recover from it.
**
** Side Effects:
**	    none
**
** History:
**	15-jun-86 (seputis)
**          initial creation
**	20-feb-91 (seputis)
**	    make non-zero initialization of memory an xDEBUG option
**	09-jan-1996 (toumi01; from 1.1 axp_osf port)
**	    Cast (long) 3rd... EXsignal args to avoid truncation.
