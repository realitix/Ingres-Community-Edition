**          add elements to help detect equi-joins used in implicit link-backs
**	    of aggregate temporaries, used in outer join flattening
**	 8-jul-99 (hayke02)
**	    Added OPL_IFNULL in opl_smask in order to indicate that we have
**	    found a PST_BOP node that performs the ifnull() function. This
**	    new mask value is used to indicate that a boolean factor cannot
**	    be evaluated until the outer join is evaluated (by calling 
**	    opl_bfnull()). This change fixes bug 94375.
**	2-dec-02 (inkdo01)
**	    Added OPL_CASEOP in opl_smask to indicate that we're traversing
**	    a case expression in opzcreate.c. The flag indicates that even
**	    though an OJ inner var may be referenced here, the expression isn't
**	    to be evaluated until after the OJ (fixes bug 109174).
**	14-Nov-08 (kibro01) b121225
**	    Added OPL_UNDEROR to determine if during tree traversal we are
**	    underneath an OR statement, whereupon "is not null" must be dealt
**	    with the same as "is null" - i.e. it cannot be determined until
**	    the relevant OJ parts are assembled.  It only degrades the join
**	    in the case where it is not used under an OR.
