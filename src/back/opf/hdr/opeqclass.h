** Name: OPE_EQCLIST - equivalence class element
**
** Description:
**      This element represents an equivalence class; i.e. a partition
**      of joinop attributes referenced directly and indirectly in the query.
**      Two attributes are in the same equivalence class if there is
**      an equality between them.  This information is used to determine
**      the validity of a join during enumeration.  The optimizer
**      will rip apart the query tree, and place the semantic information about
**      equi-joins into the concept of an equivalence class.  In fact, the
**      binary operator "=" is "thrown away" in this case.  The model of
**      equivalence classes is much more convenient for join optimizations.
**      Note that the same attribute cannot belong to two equivalence classes
**      since if this were true, the equivalence classes would be merged into
**      one.
**
** History:
**     15-mar-86 (seputis)
**          initial creation
**     24-oct-88 (seputis)
**          added ope_nulljoin field
**     10-jun-91 (seputis)
**	    fix for b37172 - make histogram estimates more predictable
**	12-aug-91 (seputis)
**	    -use tag field for OPZ_ATTS to attempt to remove lint warnings
**	7-dec-93 (ed)
**	    b56139 - add OPE_HIST_NEEDED to mark attributes which
**	    need histograms,... needed since target list is traversed
**	    earlier than before
**	31-jan-94 (rganski)
**	    Removed ope_sargp, due to change to oph_sarglist().
**	28-may-96 (inkdo01)
**	    Add flag to identify spatial join eqclasses
**	8-aug-05 (inkdo01)
**	    Add ope_ojs to aid the placement of join predicates from
**	    ON clauses, as well as OPE_NOTOUTER (for same purpose).
**	24-aug-05 (inkdo01)
**	    Remove above change - problem was fixed differently.
**	21-jul-06 (hayke02)
**	    Re-introduce ope_ojs to keep track of which outer joins created
**	    which eq classes. This change fixes bug 116406.
**	7-jan-2009 (dougi)
**	    Added OPE_MORETHANJOIN and OPE_JOINIX flag for X100 use (initially).
**	27-jan-2010 (dougi)
**	    Added OPE_REFNOJOINIX flag (for X100) and ope_nojoinix map of join
**	    EQCs with no join index.

**
** Description:
**      This structure contains information pertaining to the concept
**      of equivalence classes.  See Bob Kooi's dissertation for more
**      detailed information.  Basically, an equivalence class is a
**      partitioning of joinop attributes.  Two attributes are in the same
**      equivalence class if and only if there is a equi-joining
**      clause between them.  This equi-joining clause may be explicit
**      or implicit; i.e. due to the way indexes are modelled, the optimizer
**      may generate implicit join clauses.
