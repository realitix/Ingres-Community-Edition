** History: 
**      20-feb-86 (seputis)
**          initial creation
**	8-sep-92 (ed)
**	    use correct RDF structure
**	07-apr-93 (ralph)
**	    DELIM_IDENT:
**	    Added ops_dbxlate to OPS_CB, which points to case translation mask.
**	    Added ops_cat_own to OPS_CB, which points to catalog owner name.
**      16-sep-93 (smc)
**          Made ops_sid a CS_SID.

** Name: OPT_SESSION - session level trace vector for the optimizer

** Description:
**	This structure defines a trace vector for the optimizer.  It will
**      be used for session level trace flags.
**    	These flags can be selected by the SET commands.  
**    	The default state of each flag is FALSE.

** Name: OPS_CB - Session Control Block for the optimizer
**
** Description:
**      This control block contains only the information that persists
**      between optimizations.  The size of the session control block 
**      will be as small as possible since one will exist per user in 
**      the system.
**
**      The caller of the OPF is responsible for allocating space for
**      this control block, and passing a pointer to the OPS_CB
**      in the control block associated with the entry point (e.g. OPF_CB).
**
** History:
**     20-feb-86 (seputis)
**          initial creation
**     23-oct-88 (seputis)
**          added coordinator database info

**	07-apr-93 (ralph)
**	    DELIM_IDENT:

**	    Added ops_cat_own to OPS_CB, which points to catalog owner name.
**	01-sep-93 (jhahn)
**	    Added ops_psession_id and ops_session_ctr for maintaining server
**	    lifetime unique id's.
**	13-may-94 (ed)
**	    b59537 - added variable to help in skipping non-critical consistency
