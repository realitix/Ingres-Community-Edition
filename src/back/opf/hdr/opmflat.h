** Name: OPM_FAGG - function aggregate descriptor
**
** Description:
**      This structure describes the function aggregate which is associated
**      with a function attribute.
**      - opm_reqc represents equi-joins which were originally correlated
**      so that during aggregate operator placement, the subtree must
**      for each equivalence class, a relation from the outer contributing
**      and attribute to this equivalence class.  Other placement algorithms
**      will ensure that all relations from the inner will be already in
**      the subtree for the aggregate.  A desirable alternative is to
**	allow a double outer join for this special case, since only
**	equijoins will be possible and not boolean factors from the aggregate
**	on clause.
**	select r.a from r,s where s.a = (select count(t.a) from t
**	    where t.b=r.b and t.c=s.c)
**	Normally a cart prod is required prior to the outer join of r,s to t
**	but it may be desirable to group on t.b and t.c and calculate the
**	count aggregate, and then perform 2 outer joins.  There are boolean
**	factor placement adjustments that need to be made to accomodate this.
