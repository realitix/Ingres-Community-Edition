** Name: OPS_STATE  - Information that persists for duration of one optimization
**
** Description:
**      This structure points to all state information regarding the
**      optimization of one particular query i.e. once the query optimization
**      is completed all information contained in this structure is discarded.
**      This structure is allocated on the stack upon a request for a
**      query optimization.  
**       
**      This structure contains a pointer to the session control block.  Note,
**      that the session control block also contains a pointer to this 
**      structure.  This redundancy occurs for the following reason.
**      If an interrupt occurs then the session control block is the
**      handle used to access any state information.  However, during
**      normal processing the OPS_STATE structure is passed to each phase
**      of optimization.
**
**      Within each phase of optimization, there is
**      a local state variable created for that phase.  That state variable
**      will contain a pointer to this global state variable.  The local state
**      variable will be passed around to the individual routines of the 
**      respective phase.  This approach will reduce the visibility of any 
**      variables not required by other phases.
**
** History:
**     24-feb-86 (seputis)
**          initial creation
**      19-july-87 (eric)
**          Added ops_sstream_id for stack style memory allocation of ULM
**          memory.
**	28-jan-89 (paul)
**	    Added state information required for processing rule action lists.
**	20-sep-89 (seputis)
**	    Added outer join structure ops_goj
**	16-may-90 (seputis)
**	    - b21536, move variables which apply to enumeration only
**      26-nov-90 (stec)
**          Added a ptr to print buffer for routines dealing with debug
**          output for trace points like op150.
**      26-dec-90 (seputis)
**          - add support for OPC so that the update tid can be found without
**            a local variable defined
**          - added variables to calculate keyed lookup costs
**      28-dec-90 (stec)
**          Removed previous change; ptr will be placed in OPC_STATE struct.
**      18-apr-91 (seputis)
**          - fix for b36920 - added new defines
**      10-jun-91 (seputis)
**          - fix for b37233
**      27-mar-92 (seputis)
**          - fix for b43339
**      26-oct-92 (jhahn)
**          Added ops_inStatementEndRules.
**	25-mar-94 (ed)
**	    bug 59355 - an outer join can change the result of a resdom
**	    expression from non-null to null, this change needs to be propagated
**	    for union view target lists to all parent query references in var nodes
**	    or else OPC/QEF will not allocate the null byte and access violations
**	    may occur
**	24-may-02 (inkdo01)
**	    Added OPS_MEMTAB_XFORM flag to control MS Access where clause transform.
**	28-nov-02 (inkdo01 for hayke02)
**	    Added OPS_DECCOERCION flag for decimal stupidities.
**	15-june-06 (dougi)
**	    Added ops_inBeforeRule & ops_firstBeforeRule for "before" triggers.
**	14-Mar-2007 (kschendel) SIR 122513
**	    Rename pcjoin flag to just indicate partitions are around.
**	17-april-2008 (dougi)
**	    Added OPS_TPROCS flag for table procedure support.
**	26-aug-2008 (dougi)
**	    Added OPS_X100 flag for X100 support.
**	9-dec-2008 (dougi)
**	    Added OPS_SOMESAGGS flag for X100.
