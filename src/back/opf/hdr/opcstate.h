**	    OPC_OBJECT_ID

** History: $Log-for RCS$
**      22-jul-86 (eric)
**          created
**	28-jan-89 (paul)
**	    Added additional state information required for rules processing.
**	20-sep-89 (paul)
**	    Added support to allow the old and new TID values to be used as
**	    parameters to procedures called from rules. This is a nice
**	    feature for supporting referential integrity like constraints
**	    when the table does not have a primary key.
**	28-dec-90 (stec)
**	    Modified OPC_STATE struct.
**	12-feb-93 (jhahn)
**	    Added support for statement level rules. (FIPS)

** Name: OPC_STATE - Session state info specific to query compilation 
**
** Description:
**      This structure contains the information specific to the compilation of
**	one entire particular query ie. a query that is broken up into 
**	sub-queries. This information tells us where the top QP header is for
**	this query, and what to fill the QP with.
**
**	This structure will live inside the OPS_STATE structure.
**
** History:
**      22-jul-86 (eric)
**          defined
**	28-jan-89 (paul)
**	    Added support for rules processing. This includes identifiers
**	    for the before and after row from the triggering query, a field
**	    in which to anchor the generated rule action list and a list
**	    of descriptors for the parameter list descriptors to be generated
**	    in the DSH. See comments below for more details.
**	28-dec-90 (stec)
**	    Added a ptr to print buffer for OPC routines dealing with debug
**	    output for trace points like op150.
**      30-jan-1992 (bonobo)
**	    Removed the redundant typedefs to quiesce the ANSI C 
**	    compiler warnings.
**	28-dec-92 (teresa)
**	    add OPC_REGPROC to opc_flags.
**	10-feb-93 (andre)
**	    defined OPC_STARVIEW over opc_flags.  This will serve as an
**	    indication that we are creating a STAR view
**	12-feb-93 (jhahn)
**	    Added support for statement level rules. (FIPS)
**	17-may-93 (jhahn)
**	    Added opc)invoke_rule_ahd.
**	23-oct-98 (inkdo01)
**	    Added opc_retrowno, opc_retrowoff for row producing procs.
**	17-nov-03 (inkdo01)
**	    Added opc_temprow to address opc_rows entry for intermediate 
**	    CX results buffer.
**	1-mar-04 (inkdo01)
**	    Added OPC_EXCH_N flag for parallel queries.
**	7-may-2008 (dougi)
**	    Added opc_curnode to help with table procedures.
**	21-Jun-2010 (kschendel) b123775
**	    Delete unused stmtno.
