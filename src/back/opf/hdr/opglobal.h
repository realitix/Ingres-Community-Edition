/**
** Name: OPGLOBAL.H - Global constants and typedefs
**
** Description:
**      Global objects with dependencies from many header files
**
** History:
**      10-mar-86 (seputis)
**          initial creation
**      5-oct-88 (seputis)
**          update DB_QSMEMSIZE to reflect in memory sorts in QEF
**      2-oct-88 (seputis)
**          add DD_LDB_DESC temporarily so that OPF header files
**	    can remain compatible with titan path
**      12-jan-91 (seputis)
**          added OPN_DSORTBUF to limit size of DMF preallocated
**          sort files for single table scans.
**	21-jun-95 (wilri01)
**	    increased OPB_MAXBF to 1023
**	06-mar-96 (nanpr01)
**	    Removed DB_PAGESIZE. Added DB_MINPAGESIZE for initialization
**	    of ulm. Added NO_OF_POOL as define to add max no of
**	    different buffer pools.
**      21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**          replace nat and longnat with i4
**	26-sep-00 (inkdo01)
**	    Reduced OPB_MAXBF to 256 (non-CNF support obviates need for 
**	    huge BF bit maps).
**      23-Oct-2002 (hanch04)
**          Make pagesize variables of type long (L)
**	3-dec-02 (my daughter's birthday)(inkdo01)
**	    Genericize range table size (part of range table expansion).
**	13-feb-03 (toumi01) bug 109609
**	    increase OPB_MAXBF to 1023 (Ingres 2.5 value), and create a
**	    separate OPB_MAXBF_CNF so that the threshold for doing the
**	    CNF transformations stays at the old OPB_MAXBF value of 255
**	30-dec-2004 (abbjo03)
**	    Remove VMS #ifdefs since DB_MAXVARS is now 128 which exceeds MAX_I1.
**	27-Oct-2009 (kiria01) SIR 121883
**	    Scalar sub-selects - moved the macro collections to enums to
**	    aid debugging.
