**      a PST_QNODE tree, that holds only clauses that are usefull for keying.
**      The difference is that OPC's conjunctive qual is optimized for a rapid
**      keying solution. 2) The disjunctive qualification. This is very
**	similiar to a QEF_KOR structure. Here again, OPC's version has been
**      optimized for a rapid solution. Maybe OPC's and QEF's versions can
**      be merged someday. 3) The data that is used by the two quals above.
**      The data will be sorted so that there is no duplication representation
**      of constants, either repeat query parameter or not. 4) General info
**      about the keying task at hand (ie. are we using the primary or tid key,
**      is the key an equality key or not?, etc).
