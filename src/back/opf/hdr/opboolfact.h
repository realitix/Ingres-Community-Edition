/*}
** Name: OPB_PQBF - partition qualification boolean factors associated with 
**	table partitioning columns
**
** Description:
**	This structure is used to indicate which boolean factors are
**	possible candidates for partition qualification (also called
**	partition elimination or partition pruning.)  Each partitioned
**	table points to one of these from the op-variable structure.
**
**	There is one bitmap showing which boolean factors might apply
**	to any simple (single-column) partitioning dimension, and one
**	bitmap per composite (multi-column) dimension showing which
**	boolfacts might apply to that dimension.
**
**	The reason for separating the two is that for a single-column
**	partitioning scheme, it doesn't matter how dimensions are
**	combined in a boolean factor.  A boolfact like
**	    (col1 = 1 OR col2 = 'foo')
**	where col1 and col2 are in two different dimensions can be
**	evaluated just fine.  On the other hand, a composite, multi-column
**	dimension needs all of the (leading) column values to occur
**	together so as to build up a composite partitioning scheme value.
**	Until we arrange some sort of DNF-based analysis of composite
**	schemes, like opckey does with multi-column keys, we impose
**	significant restrictions on the detection of composite dimension
**	qualification.
**
**	The PQBF structure also carries a pair of equivalence-class
**	bitmaps, one showing which eqclasses correspond to simple one-column
**	dimensions, and the other showing eqclasses corresponding to all
**	of the partitioning columns.  In both cases the bitmaps are
**	restricted to columns / eqc's that actually appear somewhere
**	in the subquery.  Composite dimensions that only appear in
**	part are excluded in their entirety.
**
**	Note: the PQBF structure identifies all boolfacts that might
**	assist with partition qualification for the table, but that is
**	not the whole story;  at suitable join nodes, we also need to
**	consider join eqclasses which are implicit "t1.a = t2.b" predicates
**	that do not appear as such in the boolfact table.
**
** History:
**	14-jan-04 (inkdo01)
**	    Created (from OPB_MBF).
**	31-Jul-2007 (kschendel) SIR 122513
**	    Overhaul partition qualification mechanisms, make this struct
**	    into a bunch of bitmaps.

**      equivalence class (i.e. only one equivalence class is referenced in
**      the boolean factor).  It contains a "summary" of information on this
**      group of boolean factors.  
**
**      The opb_pmin will point to the OPB_BFVALLIST struct found in opb_keylist
**      which is a range type boolean factor i.e. OPB_BFKEYINFO.opb_sargable
**      is ADC_KLOWKEY or ADC_KRANGEKEY.  opb_pmin will point to
**      the maximum of all the minimums for all boolean factors with the same
**      equivalence class, datatype, and length.  This is the value which will
**      be used in histogram processing is eventually in query compilation
**      for keyed lookup (if no parameter constants exists for this attribute).
**   
**      A similiar argument applies for opb_pmax except that it operates on
**      ADC_KHIGHKEY ADC_KRANGEKEY.
**
**      The opb_pmin, and opb_pmax values are used during histogram
**      processing in ordering to estimate the cost of a restrict on the
**      base relation.  The assumption is that these values for parameter
**      constants are characteristic of the future values.
**      Since it includes parameter constants which may
**      change, these values may not be used in query compilation if parameter
**      constants exist.  In this case, the QEF will need to be given a 
**      list of values which will be used to search for the min and max keys 
**      at execution time.  If no parameter constants exist then opb_pmin and
**      opb_pmax can be used.
