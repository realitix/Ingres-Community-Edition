** Name: OPV_SUBSELECT - subselect descriptor for local range variable
**
** Description:
**      Used to contain information about a subselect associated with
**      a joinop range variable.  The existence of a non-null ptr to this 
**      structure in OPV_VARS implies that the range variable represents a 
**      subselect and any PST_VAR node referencing this range variable
**      actually references a subselect target
**      list item. This range variable implies
**      restrictions with respect to placement in the join tree i.e. the
**      range variable must be the inner of an "SEJOIN", and all attributes
**      needed to evaluate the subselect must be available at the immediate
**      parent of this leaf node.  All boolean factors which reference this
**      subselect must also be able to be calculated at the immediate parent.
**         If two subselects are in the same boolean factor then they will
**      also be in this list.  Thus, this list represents a group of
**      subselects which must be evaluated together, because they are
**      connected by boolean factors.  Note that boolean factors can be
**      connected by subselects, and subselects can be connected by boolean
**      factors.
**         This structure describes equivalence classes required to evaluate
**      the subselect.  An SEJOIN is used for this evaluation and in general
**      it is probably a good idea to sort the outer tuples used to SEJOIN
**      to this range variable.  It is assumed that the query compilation
**      will define a multi-attribute sort on the outer, given more than
**      one correlated attribute on the inner (if a sort node is available on
**      the outer).  The only restriction on this multi-attribute sort will
**      be that the first equivalence class is same as that in the outer sort
**      node.  FIXME- need to introduce multi-attribute sort information to
**      CO nodes.

** Name: OPV_VARS - one joinop range table element (a table descriptor)
**
** Description:
**      The structure contains the information describing either a table
**      or index used in a query.  Note, that whether an element describes
**      a primary relation or an index relation is contained implicitly
**      within its position in the range table; i.e. elements 0 to (opv_prv-1)
**      in the range table are primary relations.
**      
**      The relation descriptor information is accessed via the same structure
**      as the PSF (parser facility) so that a global cache can easily be
**      introduced at a later date.  The current design is such that no
**      memory will be owned by a particular facility concurrently.  This
**      will prevent inter-facility bugs.  As Jupiter stabilizes, it may
**      become desirable to have a common global cache.  Using the same
**      relation description typedef will make this much easier.

** Name: OPV_RT - joinop range variable table (local to one sub-query)
**
** Description:
**
**      Range tables is an overloaded term in ingres which has different
**      meanings depending on the context.  At the user level, a range
**      variable is explicitly declared and the parser maintains a
**      corresponding table .  The parser will expand views so that parser's
**      range table will also contain implicit definitions. The query tree 
**      header contains a copy of this which is input to the optimizer.  The
**      optimizer then creates two other tables which it calls a global range
**      table and a local joinop table.
**
**      The joinop range table has a different organization from the
**      global range table (or the parser range table).  The variable map
**      supplied by the root node of the query is used to determine which
**      global range variables are used.  These range variables are
**      then used to build the local range table which is more convenient for 
**      the optimization process (i.e. it includes a number of state variables
**      useful for optimization.  The global range table is sparse, the
**      joinop range table is dense (i.e. elements of this array are allocated
**      from element 0).  
**      The global range table includes only explicitly reference base 
**      relations.  However, since indexes are modelled as tables in ingres,
**      joinop will add any indexes which may be useful in evaluating the
**      query to the local joinop range table.  
**
**      The query tree var nodes are renamed to joinop local range table
**      naming scheme.  This means a range variable is represented by an
**      index to local array of pointers.
**
**      There may be some indexes defined in the range table that
**      will not be used.  The optimization process will select all indexes
**      that could possibly be useful, and then eliminate those that are
**      not beneficial.  For this reason, the size of the optimizer range
**      table must be larger than the query tree range table (which only
**      specifies base relations).  Currently, there will be a fixed limit
**      on the size of the range table.  The eventual goal is to allow this
**      to be a dynamic structure (in a later phase).
**
**      There are many joinop local range tables (one for each subquery) but
**      only one global range table shared among all the subqueries.
**      There was thought given to using only one range table for all subqueries
**      but this would be difficult since the joinop range table contains
**      information which is unique to the subquery i.e. equivalence classes...
**      Equivalence classes and joinop attributes nodes would be 
**      difficult (and undesirable) to share between sub-queries.

** History:
**     15-mar-86 (seputis)
**          initial creation
**     9-nov-89 (seputis)
**	    added opa_gvid for fix to b8160
**     26-dec-90(seputis)
**	    add support for common table ID detection
**      18-sep-92 (ed)
**          bug 44850 - removed opv_lrv to support different mapping of global
**          to local variables
**	12-feb-93 (jhahn)
**	    Added support for statement level rules. (FIPS)
**      7-dec-93 (ed)
**          b56139 - add opv_attrmap to keep track of union view attributes
**	    used in parent queries
**      25-mar-94 (ed)
**          bug 59355 - an outer join can change the result of a resdom
**          expression from non-null to null, this change needs to be propagated
**          for union view target lists to all parent query references in var
**          nodes or else OPC/QEF will not allocate the null byte and access
**          violations may occur
**	18-june-99 (inkdo01)
**	    Added OPV_TEMP_NOSTATS flag and opv_ttmodel for temp table model
**	    histograms feature.
**	3-Sep-2005 (schka24)
**	    Remove "global histogram" pointer, nothing ever set it.
**	30-Jun-2006 (kschendel)
**	    Replace gcop with gcost so that we have someplace to modify
**	    aggregate-result size/cost info without altering the bestco.
**	    Bestco is the input, gcost is the output.
**	17-april-2008 (dougi)
**	    Added OPV_TPROC flag for table procedures.
**	13-may-2009 (dougi)
**	    Added opv_ucount and opv_uvector for tracking sets of unique
**	    columns.

** Name: OPV_GRT - Global range table
**
** Description:
**      The global range table is an array of pointers to global range table
**      elements.  The global range table exists only for the duration of one
**      optimization; i.e. a new one is built every time.  The respective
**      element of the joinop local range tables will point to this element in a
**      multi to one map.  An element in the range table is not assigned
**      by indicating using a NULL value.  The elements of this table
**      are initially set by looking at the variable bit map of the root node.
**
**      Temporary tables will be assigned slots in the global range table
**      by using the first non-NULL entry in the table.  Once an entry is
**      made, it is not deallocated from this table.  Thus at the end of
**      the optimization, this table will contain elements representing all 
**      tables referenced in the query.
**
**      The maximum number of elements in the global range table
**      is larger than the parser limit of PST_NUMVARS, since we can create
**      temporary relations from aggregate processing.
**
**      The indexes which are implicitly referenced are not found in this
**      range table.
