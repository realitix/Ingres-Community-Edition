** Name: OPHISTO.H - Structures used for histograms
**
** Description:
**      This file contains the structures used to manipulate histogram
**      information.
**
** History: 
**      10-mar-86 (seputis)
**          initial creation
**      06-nov-89 (fred)
**          Added constants in support of default histograms.  These are used
**	    when a datatype is encountered which has no histograms.
**	09-nov-92 (rganski)
**	    Added new fields oph_charnunique and oph_chardensity to
**	    OPH_INTERVAL for new character histogram statistics.
**	24-may-93 (rganski)
**	    Removed define of OPH_MAXHIST, which has been replaced by
**	    DB_MAX_HIST_LENGTH in dbms.h.
**	20-sep-93 (rganski)
**	    Added new field oph_version to OPH_INTERVAL.
**	7-jan-96 (inkdo01)
**	    Added per-cell array of repetition factors to OPH_HISTOGRAM.

/*
**	Default Histogram Support
**
**  These #define's provide support for default histograms, a VERY rudimentary
**  attempt to provide support for datatypes which lack histogram support.
**  This is provided in conjunction with large object support.
**
**  For such datatypes, the histogram datatype will be DB_CHA_TYPE, with a
**  length of 8, precision of 0.  All data elements will map to the string
**  "nohistos".
**
**  This functionality is placed in OPF so that it can be easily excised when
**  OPF provides support for the lack of histograms in a datatype.

** Name: OPH_COUNTS - array of cell counts for a histogram
**
** Description:
**	This structure is used to represent an array of cell counts for
**      histograms.  There are two types of cell counts which can be used
**      TYPE 1 - A count which is a percentage of the number of tuples in the
**      relation (which contains an attribute whose histogram value falls
**      in this bucket)
**      TYPE 2 - A count which is a percentage of a "type 1" histogram cell
**
**      This first element of this array is 0.0 and is always ignored in
**      histogram processing

** Name: OPH_CELLS - array of cell boundaries
**
** Description:
**	This structure is used to contain a variable number of cell boundaries.
**      Cell boundaries are histogram values which define the "histogram bucket"
**      i.e. Each boundary is defined such that the histogram cell i will 
**      represent values in the range  OPH_CELL[i-1] < value <= OPH_CELL[i] .
**      The number of bytes assigned to a OPH_CELL object equal to the length
**      of the histogram elements associated with this array.
**
**      There is a close association between this array of cell boundaries
**      and the array of cell counts.  Cell_count[i] will be associated with
**      the values in Cell_boundary[i-1]< x <= Cell_boundary[i].  The numcells
**      refers to the number of cell boundary elements (not the number of cell
**      count elements).  Thus, in the case of a default uniform int histogram;
**      the number of cells = 2; Cell_count[0] = 0.0 (as is the case in general
**      and is ignored in histogram processing) and Cell_count[1] = 1.0;
**      Cell_boundary[0]=0 and Cell_boundary[1]=1000.  This histogram means the
**      integers are uniformly distributed between 0 and 1000.

** Name: OPH_HISTOGRAM - normalized histogram structure
**
** Description:

**      structure.  The division is made since OPH_HISTOGRAM structures can

**	    character histogram statistics gathered by optimizedb on
**	    character-type attributes. oph_charnunique is the number of unique
**	    characters per character position (up to the length of the
**	    histogram values) and oph_chardensity is the character set density
**	    per character position. The character set density is a measure of
**	    how complete the character set in a character position is, stored
**	    as a floating point number between 0 and 1: a density of 1.0
**	    indicates a complete character set, given the number of unique
**	    characters; lower densities indicate sparser character sets. See
**	    the Character Histogram Enhancements specification for more
**	    details.
**	18-jan-93 (rganski)
**	    Changed comment about db_length: no longer has max of 8.
**	20-sep-93 (rganski)
**	    Added new field oph_version, which indicates the version number of
**	    the histogram.
