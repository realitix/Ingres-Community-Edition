** Name: OPO_PARM - parameters for estimating cost of an operation
**
** Description:
**      This structure isolates the parameters used to evaluate the cost
**      of an operation (i.e. join, project/restrict, sort, reformat).
**      It will eventually include costs for distributed DB purposes also.

** History:
**     19-mar-86 (seputis)
**          initial creation
**     06-mar-96 (nanpr01)
**	    variable page size project.
**	13-nov-03 (inkdo01)
**	    Added opo_reduction for exchange nodes in parallel query
**	    processing.
**	13-Nov-2009 (kiria01) SIR 121883
**	    Add opo_card_* to track cardinality check needs.
**	15-mar-2010 (dougi)
**	    Size of node result tuples added (opo_twidth).

** Description:
**      This is a general
**      mechanism for defining interesting orderings based on set of
**      equivalence classes (rather than individual equivalence classes).
**      This would eventually be used to define multi-attributes joins
**      and sorts to the optimizer cost model.  
**
**      Bitmaps of OPO_ISORT types would be difficult to maintain since
**      the structure will grow during the enumeration phase, but 
**      multi-attribute sorts are designed so that bitmaps of OPO_ISORT
**      is not required.
**
**      There are exact and inexact orderings, the inexact orderings
**      are a simple set of equivalence classes.  The exact orderings
**      can include inexact orderings in the list but can never include
**      another exact ordering in its' opo_eqorder list.
**
**      This structure is used to describe multi-attribute orderings. 
**      Logically, it can be considered an extension of the equivalence
**      class array.  Any OPO_ISORT index which is in range of the equivalence
**      class array will be considered to represent an ordering on that 
**      equivalence class only (single attribute).  Any OPO_ISORT out of
**      range of the equivalence class array will represent one of these
**      multi-attribute ordering structures.  This is done so that
**      bit vectors on "interesting orderings" can be defined.

**      8-may-92 (seputis)
**          change opo_pointer to i2, since overflow can occur and this

**	21-may-93 (ed)
**	    created union for opo_var, opo_ojid so that outer join id
**	    can be stored in CO node without increasing size of CO node
**	10-nov-03 (inkdo01)
**	    Added DB_EXCH for parallel query processing.
**	2-mar-04 (inkdo01)
**	    Added opo_ccount for parallel processing partitioned tables.
**	22-july-04 (inkdo01)
**	    Added opo_punion flag to define parallel unions under exch.
**	29-oct-04 (inkdo01)
**	    Replaced unused opo_memory by opo_held for greedy enumeration
**	    memory management.
**	19-jan-05 (inkdo01)
**	    Added opo_exchagg flag to implement parallel aggregation.
**	5-Dec-2006 (kschendel) SIR 122512
**	    Add unrestricted join ordering for use by hash join.
**	30-may-2008 (dougi)
**	    Added opo_tprocjoin flag for table procedures.
**	9-april-2009 (dougi)
**	    Numerous fields added for X100 support - opo_clusteqc, opo_bfs,

**	    opo_FDieqcs, opo_FDdeqcs.
**	17-feb-2010 (dougi)
**	    Added opo_refnojix.
**	5-mar-2010 (dougi)
**	    Added opo_dupselim to identify dups elimination nodes more 
**	    accurately for IVW.
**	26-apr-2010 (dougi)
**	    Added opo_jixeqcs/njixeqcs for IVW support (and maybe later for
**	    native Ingres support).
**	20-may-2010 (dougi)
**	    Added opo_ucount/uvector to define sets of unique EQCs in each
**	    node. Used (among other things) to identify need for dups elim.
**	31-aug-2010 (dougi)
**	    Added opo_x100nullj flag to indicate null joins in X100 queries.
**	10-Aug-2010 (kschendel) b124218
