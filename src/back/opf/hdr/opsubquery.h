/*}
** Name: OPS_SUBQUERY - Define the header structure for a sub query
**
** Description:
**      This structure defines the header for a subquery.  The ops_next
**      field will provide a linked list of the subqueries in the order that
**      processing should occur.  Consider an "aggregate tree" i.e. the
**      query tree with all the nodes except aggregates removed then this
**      list would be a post-fix ordering (approximetely - aggregates are
**      calculated together in the same subquery where possible).  Each of
**      the subqueries is considered to be a retrieve into temporary table
**      except the last one which is the main query.
**       
**      The original query tree will not exist after it has been modified
**      into a list of subqueries i.e. the original tree will be modified
**      as opposed to being copied and modified.
**
**      This structure is passed to most routines in joinop and enumeration
**      as the "state variable" since routines in these phases will operate
**      within the context of a subquery (e.g. an equivalence class in this
**      subquery has no meaning in the next subquery).  On the other hand
**      the aggregate processing phase operates on subqueries as entities
**      within a global context, so the global state variable is passed to
**      routines in the aggregate processing phase (i.e. OPS_STATE).
**
** History:

/*      The following structures are visible to all phases of optimization.
**      The structures have been broken into distinct groupings of major 
**      related functionality.  The utilities which initialize and otherwise
**      operate on these structures will also be separated into related groups
**      so that an "abstraction" of these structures is achieved to some degree.
**
**      The previous 4.0 global variables contained arrays of pointers to 
**      objects.  These arrays of pointers were used so that memory would be 
**      allocated to only those slots which were needed.  However, these arrays
**      of pointers had some arbitrary limits which should be eliminated.  This
**      will be the eventual goal; i.e. have structures so that there will 
**      not be any limits in the optimizer except for time and memory.
**      Currently, the initialization of the optimizer structures in some cases
**      deals with the maximum number of entries and in others it deals exactly
**      with the entries which are used, and in other cases it ignores
**      the limit since it is assumed large enough to handle all cases. 
**      The goal of eliminating the internal limits will force a consistent
**      scheme to be used.  This approach would have the advantage of
**      eliminating an arbitrary (hard to document) limit on the queries
**      to be optimized.
** 
**      It will not be possible to eliminate the arbitrary limits due to the
**      time constraints of the initial phase.  The current phase
**      will set up the structures in the anticipation of this, but will still
**      allocate the maximum number of elements.  This approach will reduce
**      the risk since only editing changes are needed which are required
**      in any case.  The idea is to have a pointer to the base of an array 
**      of pointers or bits, where only the necessary number of elements is 
**      allocated.
