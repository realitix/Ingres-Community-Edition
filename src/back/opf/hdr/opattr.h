/*}
** Name: OPZ_ATTS - joinop attribute element
**
** Description:
**      This structure defines the "joinop" attribute.  A joinop attribute
**      is really a (range variable, range variable attribute) pair.  Joinop
**      algorithms (i.e. equivalence class partitioning of attributes) are
**      more naturally implemented by using a joinop attribute rather than
**      a range variable attribute.  The query tree is modified so that the
**      attribute field in the var nodes will contain the joinop attribute
**      which is really the index into the array of pointers to this element.
**
**      There is exactly one attribute element for each (range variable,
**      attribute) pair used in the query tree; i.e. are no duplicates
**      in this array of attribute elements.
** History:
**      15-mar-86 (seputis)
**          initial creation
**      12-jan-91 (seputis)
**          add mask of booleans for attribute descriptor
**      10-jun-91 (seputis)
**          fix for b37172, make histogram estimates more predictable
**	31-jan-94 (rganski)
**	    Removed opz_sargp, due to change to oph_sarglist().
**	13-mar-97 (inkdo01)
**	    Add OPZ_QUAL flag to indicate joinop attrs in where/on clauses.
**	2-june-00 (inkdo01)
**	    Added OPZ_COMP flag to indicate dummy attrs representing 
**	    composite histograms.
**	 6-sep-04 (hayke02)
**	    Added OPZ_COLLATT to indicate that this is a resdom attribute
**	    created in the presence of a colaltion sequence. This change
**	    fixes problem INGSRV 2940, bug 112873.
**	 8-nov-05 (hayke02)
**	    Added OPZ_VAREQVAR to indicate that this attribute is below
**	    an ADI_EQ_OP PST_BOP node with PST_VAR left and right. This
**	    change fixes bug 115420 problem INGSRV 3465.
**	15-aug-05 (inkdo01)
**	    Added opz_eqcmap for multi-EQC attrs (more OJ folliws).
**      02-may-2011 (huazh01)
**          remove the fix to b114308, b112873, b115420, and b116868.
