** Name:	opqdata.c
**
** Description:	Global data for opq facility.
**
** History:
**
**      19-Oct-95 (fanra01)
**          Created.
**	23-sep-1996 (canor01)
**	    Updated.
**
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	29-Sep-2004 (drivi01)
**	    Added LIBRARY jam hint to put this file into IMPOPFLIBDATA
**	    in the Jamfile.
**	15-july-05 (inkdo01)
**	    Update default histogram sizes to 100 cells for inexact and 
**	    300 for exact.
**	22-dec-06 (hayke02)
**	    Add nosetstats bool for -zy optimizedb flag to switch off 'set
**	    statistics'. This change implements SIR 117405.
**      13-Jul-2011 (hanal04) SIR 125458
**          Update cs_elog calls inline with sc0e_putAsFcn changes.
