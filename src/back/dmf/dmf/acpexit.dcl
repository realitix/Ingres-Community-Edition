!# Name:  
!#	ACPEXIT - Archiver Termination Command Script
!#	
!#
!#
!# Usage: 
!#	acpexit  error_number  [database_name]
!#
!#	    error_number  : Termination status from archiver.
!#			    A list of termination error codes is given
!#			    at the end of this script.
!#
!#	    database_name : Name of database being processed when
!#			    archiver stopped.  This argument may
!#			    not be present if the termination reason
!#			    was not associated with a database or if
!#			    the database was not known.
!#
!# Description: 
!#
!#	The acpexit script is run automatically by the archiver whenever
!#	some situation prevents it from moving records from the Ingres
!#	Log File to the database journal files (usually a lack of disk
!#	space on the journal disk).
!#
!#	When archive processing stops, this script is executed to give
!#	notification of the event.
!#
!#	The installation will remain active and database writes will
!#	be allowed, but no log records will be moved out of the Ingres
!#	Log File until archive processing is restarted.
!#
!#	If archive processing is not restarted then eventually the Ingres
!#	Log File will become full and work in the installation will be
!#	suspended until log records can be archived.  This situation is
!#	known as LOGFULL and is indicated by the LOGFULL status given
!#	by logstat.
!#
!#	Upon termination of archive processing (and the execution of this
!#	script), steps should be taken to resolve the archive problem and
!#	archiving should be restarted with the Ingres command ingstart -dmfacp.
!#
!# History:
!#	10-Jun-98 (kinte01)
!#		Replaced 'iiarchive' with 'ingstart -dmfacp' for Ingres II

!# Termination error numbers:
!#
!#   E_DM9850_ACP_NORMAL_EXIT
!#
!#	Value : 235600		Hex: 39850
!#	Message written to Archiver Log:
!#	
!#		Archiver shutdown has occurred as part of a shutdown of 
!#		the Ingres installation.  For further information on the 
!#		installation shutdown, refer to the II_RCP log file.
!#
!#	Description:
!#
!#		The archiver has terminated upon request of the Logging System.
!#		The Logging System will direct the archiver to shut down as part
!#		of normal installation shutdown proceedings.
!#
!#		This message is written by the archiver as part of its shutdown
!#		protocols.  It does not indicate an error in archive processing.
!#
!#
!#  E_DM9851_ACP_INITIALIZE_EXIT
!#
!#	Value : 235601		Hex: 39851
!#	Message written to Archiver Log:
!#	
!#		An error has been encountered during Archiver initialization 
!#		which prevents archive processing from starting.  Please make 
!#		sure that the Ingres installation is running and that there 
!#		is not already an active Archiver.  See the Archiver Log 
!#		(IIACP.LOG) for more detailed information on the failure.
!#
!#	Description:
!#
!#		An error occurred during archiver startup and the archiver 
!#		could not be initialized.  The Archiver Log (IIACP.LOG) 
!#		should contain more detailed information about the specific 
!#		errors encountered.
!#
!#  E_DM9852_ACP_JNL_WRITE_EXIT
!#
!#	Value : 235602		Hex: 39852
!#	Message written to Archiver Log:
!#		Archive processing cannot continue due to the inability to 
!#		write journal records for database %0c to the database journal 
!#		directory: %1c.  This is probably due to a lack of available 
!#		disk space on the journal device.  The error occurred during 
!#		an attempt to write to the journal file.  Please check for 
!#		disk space and the ability to create/write files in the above 
!#		journal directory.  The Archiver Log (IIACP.LOG) will have 
!#		more detailed information about the problem, including the 
!#		Operating System's return code from the requested operation.
!#		To continue archive processing following resolution of the 
!#		above problem, run the Ingres command 'ingstart -dmfacp'.
!#	
!#	Description:
!#		Archiver could not write journal records for indicated database
!#		to the journal files.  This is probably due to lack of disk
!#		space on the journal device.
!#
!#		The error may be encountered during an attempt to create a new
!#		journal file or extend an old one.  Journal files are numbered
!#		sequentially in the database journal location with access done
!#		only to the highest number file.
!#
!#
!#  E_DM9853_ACP_RESOURCE_EXIT
!#
!#	Value : 235603		Hex: 39853
!#	Message written to Archiver Log:
!#		Archive processing cannot continue due to a failure to 
!#		allocate a %0c resource.  Please check the Archiver Log 
!#		(IIACP.LOG) for more detailed information about the resource 
!#		required.  This error may occur due to lack of logging, 
!#		locking, or memory resources.   If logging or locking 
!#		resources have been exhausted the system may need to be 
!#		shutdown, reconfigured to allocate more %1c, and then 
!#		restarted.  Inability to allocate memory may indicate process 
!#		quota limitations.  If it is suspected that the resource 
!#		exhaustion was a temporary condition, continuation of archive 
!#		processing without system reconfiguration may be attempted by 
!#		running 'ingstart -dmfacp'.  If system reconfiguration cannot be 
!#		performed immediately, resources may be recovered by 
!#		temporarily decreasing the amount of concurrent activity 
!#		to the Ingres system.  'ingstart -dmfacp' must be run to continue 
!#		archive processing.
!#
!#	Description:
!#		Archiver could not allocate a resource necessary for processing.
!#
!#		Types of resource failure are:
!#
!#		Logging - Could not start transaction for archive processing.
!#			  Logging system configuration should be altered to
!#			  increase maximum number of concurrent transactions.
!#		Locking - Could not allocate lock list for archive processing.
!#			  Locking system configuration should be altered to
!#			  increase the number of lock lists.
!#		Memory  - Could not allocate memory for archive processing.
!#			  This may be due to process quotas or actual system
!#			  resources.  On VMS systems, quotas on the ACP should
!#			  be examined to determine if they can be increased
!#			  (See the Ingres utility script RUN_ACP.COM).  If
!#			  system memory is exhausted, then the system load may
!#			  need to be decreased.
!#
!#		Since most resource exhaustions are temporary and occur at peak
!#		loads, the archiver can often be restarted immediately without
!#		actually having to reconfigure the system.  Some resources may
!#		be recovered by decreasing the amount of concurrent activity to
!#		the Ingres system.
!#
!#
!#  E_DM9854_ACP_JNL_ACCESS_EXIT
!#
!#	Value : 235604		Hex: 39854
!#	Message written to Archiver Log:
!#		Archive processing cannot continue due to the inability to 
!#		access a journal file for database %0c.  Please check the 
!#		Archiver Log (IIACP.LOG) for the type of access which failed, 
!#		the name of the journal file accessed and any Operating System 
!#		messages describing the type of failure.  Make sure that the 
!#		database journal directory (%1c) exists and that the Archiver 
!#		has permission to create and write to files in it.  This error 
!#		could also be the result of exhaustion of system or process 
!#		file resources or quotas.  To continue archive processing 
!#		following resolution of the above problem, run the Ingres 
!#		command 'ingstart -dmfacp'.
!#
!#	Description:
!#		Archiver could not open/write/close journal records for the 
!#		indicated database to the journal files.
!#
!#		This error may indicate a permission or quota problem.  The 
!#		Archiver Log should be reviewed for detailed information 
!#		specific to the problem just encountered.
!#
!#
!#  E_DM9855_ACP_LG_ACCESS_EXIT
!#
!#	Value : 235605		Hex: 39855
!#	Message written to Archiver Log:
!#		Archive processing cannot continue due an error reading 
!#		information from the Logging System. Please check the 
!#		Archiver Log (IIACP.LOG) for the specific operation which 
!#		failed and more detailed messages describing the error.  
!#		Verify that the Ingres Installation is currently running.  
!#		It is possible that failures attempting to read the Ingres 
!#		Log File could be caused by process quota limitations; if so, 
!#		this should be reflected in the error log.  If the cause of 
!#		the error is not apparent, try restarting archive processing 
!#		via the Ingres command 'ingstart -dmfacp'.  If the same error is 
!#		encountered, try stopping and restarting the Ingres 
!#		installation.
!#	
!#	Description:
!#		Archiver encountered an error from a call to the Logging 
!#		System or in an attempt to read/write transaction log file 
!#		records.
!#
!#		This may indicate a problem with the Ingres Log File or with the
!#		information in the Logging System.  First verify that 
!#		permissions and quotas for the Archiver are set correctly.
!#
!#		If the problem is with Logging System information, then 
!#		restarting the installation should clear up the problem.
!#
!#
!#  E_DM9856_ACP_DB_ACCESS_EXIT
!#
!#	Value : 235606		Hex: 39856
!#	Message written to Archiver Log:
!#		Archive processing cannot continue on database %0c due to a 
!#		failure accessing the database config file.  Please check the 
!#		Archiver Log (IIACP.LOG) for further information about the 
!#		error encountered.  Check the existence of and permissions on 
!#		the file 'aaaaaaaa.cnf' in the database's root DATA location.  
!#		If the database config file has been removed or no longer 
!#		exists, it must be restored using a backup copy.  A backup 
!#		copy of the config file may normally be found in the database 
!#		DUMP location.  To continue archive processing following 
!#		resolution of the above problem, run the Ingres command 
!#		'ingstart -dmfacp'.
!#	
!#	Description:
!#		Archiver could not open/close/write the database config file
!#		for the specified database.
!#
!#		This may indicate a permission or quota problem - or could be
!#		caused by non-existence of the config file.
!#
!#		Most database-specific problems can be bypassed by disabling
!#		logging on the failing database in order to get archiver 
!#		processing going - then re-enabling journal processing after 
!#		the archiver has skipped over the troublesome area of journal 
!#		processing.  This can be done through:
!#
!#			 'alterdb -disable_journaling'  
!#
!#		Note that this will cause journal records for the database to 
!#		be discarded, so that they cannot be used in auditdb or 
!#		rollforward processing; the database will no longer be 
!#		journaled.  Journaling should be re-enabled as soon as possible 
!#		by issuing a new checkpoint: ckpdb +j.
!#
!#
!#  E_DM9857_ACP_JNL_RECORD_EXIT
!#
!#	Value : 235607		Hex: 39857
!#	Message written to Archiver Log:
!#		Archive processing cannot continue on database %0c due to an 
!#		unexpected log record which the archiver cannot process.  
!#		Please check the Archiver Error Log (IIACP.LOG) for further 
!#		information about the error encountered.  This may indicate a 
!#		journaling error on the above database which prevents journaled 
!#		log records from being moved from the transaction log file to 
!#		the database journal file.  If the Archiver Log does not 
!#		indicate a solution, try restarting archive processing (using 
!#		the 'ingstart -dmfacp' command) to see if the problem is temporary 
!#		rather than a symptom of inconsistent journal records.  If the 
!#		same problem is encountered, then journaling should be disabled 
!#		on the database to allow the archiver to bypass the 
!#		inconsistent journal records.  See the 'alterdb' command for 
!#		information on disabling journal processing for a database.
!#	
!#	Description:
!#		A journaling error was encountered while attempting to process
!#		a journal record for the specified database.  This probably 
!#		indicates an inconsistency in journal information for that db.
!#
!#		This may be an invalid or unrecognized type of log record, or
!#		a log record not associated with a transaction known to the
!#		archiver (ie. the Begin Transaction / End Transaction pair for 
!#		this transaction were not found).
!#
!#		Most database-specific problems can be bypassed by disabling
!#		logging on the failing database in order to get archiver 
!#		processing going - then re-enabling journal processing after 
!#		the archiver has skipped over the troublesome area of journal 
!#		processing.  This can be done through:
!#
!#			 'alterdb -disable_journaling'  
!#
!#		Note that this will cause journal records for the database to 
!#		be discarded, so that they cannot be used in auditdb or 
!#		rollforward processing; the database will no longer be 
!#		journaled.  Journaling should be re-enabled as soon as possible 
!#		by issuing a new checkpoint: ckpdb +j.
!#
!#
!#  E_DM9858_ACP_ONLINE_BACKUP_EXIT
!#
!#	Value : 235608		Hex: 39858
!#	Message written to Archiver Log:
!#		Archive processing failed due to an error processing records 
!#		associated with an Online Checkpoint operation on database 
!#		%0c.  Please check the Archiver Log (IIACP.LOG) for further 
!#		information about the error encountered.  Interrupt the 
!#		Checkpoint request and issue the command 'ingstart -dmfacp' to restore 
!#		archive processing.  Use 'logstat' to check the state of the 
!#		Ingres installation; verify that the START_ARCHIVER state is 
!#		turned off.  This indicates that archive processing is 
!#		continuing normally.  Reissue the Checkpoint request to backup 
!#		the database.  If subsequent attempts to checkpoint the 
!#		database fail, try using the -l flag to force an Offline 
!#		Checkpoint.
!#	
!#	Description:
!#		The archiver failed due to an error in Online Checkpoint 
!#		processing.
!#
!#		Virtually all errors encountered during online backup are mapped
!#		to this error.  The problem may have occurred accessing II_DUMP,
!#		database or logging system information, or be due to resource
!#		or quota limitations.
!#
!#		The Archiver Log should give more detailed information as to
!#		what operation failed.
!#
!#		Usually, the archiver can be restarted immediately since the
!#		Online Backup operation will have failed.  When archive 
!#		processing continues, DUMP processing will not be done as the 
!#		checkpoint will no longer be in progress.
!#
!#		If the Checkpoint error was really an indication of bad archiver
!#		problems that were not necessarily related to checkpoint 
!#		processing (the error just happened to be encountered in a 
!#		checkpoint-specific routine), then attempts to restart the 
!#		archiver may also fail.
!#
!#
!#  E_DM9859_ACP_EXCEPTION_EXIT
!#
!#	Value : 235609		Hex: 39859
!#	Message written to Archiver Log:
!#		An unexpected exception has halted archive processing.  Please 
!#		check the Archiver Log (IIACP.LOG) for further information 
!#		about the exception.  Archive processing should be restarted 
!#		with the 'ingstart -dmfacp' command.  If the exception error continues 
!#		to occur and prevents any archive work from being done, the 
!#		installation should be shut down and restarted to clear the 
!#		problem.
!#	
!#	Description:
!#		An exception has forced the archiver to stop.  This will most 
!#		likely represent an Ingres bug and should be reported as such 
!#		to Ingres Technical Support.
!#
!#		The Archiver Log File (IIACP.LOG) should be saved and if 
!#		possible, a LOGDUMP should be performed to gather information 
!#		to use in tracking down the bug.
!#
!#		In some cases archive processing can be continued immediately 
!#		via the ingstart -dmfacp command.  If the exception error continues, 
!#		the installation should be restarted.  If the exception still 
!#		continues, then the error is probably being triggered by some 
!#		condition in the Log File itself.
!#
!#		Inspecting the Archiver Log File may give a clue as to whether 
!#		the exception occurs on processing of a particular database.  
!#		Most database-specific problems can be bypassed by temporarily 
!#		disabling logging on the database to allow the archiver to move !#		forward past the 'bad' log records.  See the ALTERDB command 
!#		for further information on this.  Note that journaling should 
!#		be re-enabled as soon as possible since the database is no 
!#		longer protected by the journaling system after journaling is 
!#		disabled.
!#
!#		If the problem cannot be isolated to processing for a particular
!#		database, or if disabling journaling does not resolve the 
!#		exception condition, then the Ingres Log File may need to be 
!#		reinitialized to clear the condition.
!#
!#
!#  E_DM985A_ACP_JNL_PROTOCOL_EXIT
!#
!#	Value : 235610		Hex: 3985A
!#	Message written to Archiver Log:
!#		Archive processing cannot continue due to an error in protocols 
!#		between the Logging System and the Ingres Archiver.  The 
!#		archiver encountered a record that it did not expect or did not 
!#		find a record that it did expect in the Ingres Log File.  
!#		Please check the Archiver Log (IIACP.LOG) for further 
!#		information about the problem.  Archive processing should be 
!#		restarted with the 'ingstart -dmfacp' command.  If the problem 
!#		persists, the installation should be shut down and restarted.  
!#		If the problem still persists, it may indicate a Log File 
!#		inconsistency which will require a Log File reinitialization.
!#	
!#	Description:
!#		The archiver encountered a log record or was given LG 
!#		information that it did not understand, or did not think was 
!#		consistent.
!#
!#		This error will usually be triggered if the archiver reads a 
!#		log record that it cannot match to any journaled database. This 
!#		will most likely represent an Ingres bug and should be reported 
!#		as such to Ingres Technical Support.
!#
!#		The Archiver Log File (IIACP.LOG) should be saved and if 
!#		possible, a LOGDUMP should be performed to gather information 
!#		to use in tracking down the bug.
!#
!#		In some cases archive processing can be continued immediately 
!#		via the ingstart -dmfacp command.  If the protocol error continues, 
!#		the installation should be restarted.
!#
!#
!#  E_DM985B_ACP_INTERNAL_ERR_EXIT
!#
!#	Value : 235611		Hex: 3985B
!#	Message written to Archiver Log:
!#		Archive processing cannot continue due to an internal error in 
!#		archiver processing.  Please check the Archiver Log 
!#		(IIACP.LOG) for further information about the problem.  
!#		Archive processing should be restarted with the 'ingstart -dmfacp' 
!#		command.  If the problem persists, the installation should be 
!#		shut down and restarted.  If the problem still persists, it 
!#		may indicate a Log File inconsistency which will require a 
!#		Log File reinitialization.
!#	
!#	Description:
!#		The archiver encountered an internal error that prevents further
!#		processing. This will most likely represent an Ingres bug and 
!#		should be reported as such to Ingres Technical Support.
!#
!#		The Archiver Log File (IIACP.LOG) should be saved and if

!#
!#
!#  E_DM985C_ACP_DMP_WRITE_EXIT 
!#
!#	Value : 235612		Hex: 3985C
!#	Message written to Archiver Log:
!#		Archive processing cannot continue due to the inability to 
!#		write dump records during an Online Checkpoint operation on 
!#		database %0c to the database dump directory: %1c.  This is 
!#		probably due to a lack of available disk space on the dump 
!#		device.  The error occurred during an attempt to write to the 
!#		dump file.  Please check for disk space and the ability to 
!#		create/write files in the above dump directory.  The Archiver 
!#		Log (IIACP.LOG) will have more detailed information about the 
!#		problem, including the Operating System's return code from the 
!#		requested operation.  The Checkpoint request should be 
!#		interrupted and the archive processing restored through the 
!#		Ingres command 'ingstart -dmfacp'.
!#	
!#	Description:
!#		Archiver could not write log records for indicated database
!#		to the dump files.  This is probably due to lack of disk
!#		space on the dump device.
!#
!#		The error may be encountered during an attempt to create a new
