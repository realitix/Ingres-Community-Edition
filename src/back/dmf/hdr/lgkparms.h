/**
** Name: LGKPARMS.H - External data structures for calls to LGK
**
** Description:
**	This file contains the RCONF structure definition. In earlier releases
**	of Ingres, the RCONF structure described the layout of a binary file
**	named rcpconfig.dat. This file was written by rcpconfig when given one
**	of the -init, -force_init, or -config options, and contained parameters
**	governing the Ingres logging, locking, and recovery systems.
**
**	With the introduction of the PM facility in Ingres 6.5, the
**	rcpconfig.dat file is no longer used. Instead, Ingres software calls PM
**	to get the logging, locking, and recovery configuration information.
**	However, it is still useful to collect together all the parameter values
**	into a single structure, and that structure is still called the RCONF,
**	because that meant we had to change less code.
**
**	So the RCONF is now used to call lgk_get_config() to get the config
**	parameters.
**
** History:
**	26-apr-1993 (andys/bryanp)
**	    Created from LGKDEF.H.
**	24-may-1993 (bryanp)
**	    Added new resource block configuration parameter.
**	20-sep-1993 (jnash)
**	    Modify cp_p to be an f8 to allow cps to be expressed with fractional
**	    components.
**	08-May-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Added nparts, number of log partitions,
**	    logkb, size of log file in KB.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	18-apr-2001 (devjo01)
**	    Change params to lgk_calculate_size, add lgk_get_counts.
**      23-Oct-2002 (hanch04)
**          Changed lgk_calculate_size to use a SIZE_TYPE to allow
**	    memory > 2 gig

**	21-june-1993 (jnash)
