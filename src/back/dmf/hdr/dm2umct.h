/**
** Name: DM2UMCT.H - Definitions for modify table utility routines.
**
** Description:
**      This file decribes the routines that modify table structures.
**
** History:
**      25-mar-1987 (Jennifer)
**          Split from dm2u.h.
**      17-may-90 (jennifer)
**          Added MCT_KEEPDATA and MCT_USEFHDR to mct_rebuild flag.
**	17-dec-1990 (bryanp)
**	    Added new fields to support Btree Index Compression
**	14-jun-1991 (Derek)
**	    Reorganized a little in support for new build interface.
**	10-mar-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Added new fields for in-memory builds.
**	7-July-1992 (rmuth)
**	    Prototyping DMF, changed mct_fhdrnext and mct_fmapnext into
**	    DM_PAGENO from i4s
**    	05-jun-1992 (kwatts)
**          Added mct_acc_tlv to DM2U_M_CONTEXT and changed mct_atts_ptr
**          to mct_data_atts and gave one more level of indirection for
**          new compression interface that bryanp first introduced.
**	29-August-1992 (rmuth)
**	    New build code add mct_lastused_data,mct_fhdr_pageno and
**	    mct_last_dpage removed mct_fmapnext and mct_fhdrnext.
**	22-oct-92 (rickh)
**	    Replaced all references to DMP_ATTS with DB_ATTS.
**	30-October-1992 (rmuth)
**	    Add flag mct_guarantee_on_disk to the mct control_block.
**	26-jul-1993 (bryanp)
**	    Replace all uses of DM_LKID with LK_LKID.
**	26-July-1993 (rmuth)
**	    Add mct_override_alloc, whilst building a table we usually
**	    preallocate mct_allocation amount. Sometimes we know we are
**	    going to use more than this amount this field allows us to
**	    allocate accordingly. For example if a user has specified an
**	    allocation of x pages for a HASH table but we calculate that
**	    we will use x+N hash buckets. This allows us to pre-allocate x+N 
**	    pages hopefully reducing fragmentation on extent based file 
**	    systems.
**	08-may-1995 (shero03)
**	    Added RTREE support
**	06-mar-1996 (stial01 for bryanp)
**	    Add mct_page_size to hold the page size for build routines.
**	06-may-1996 (nanpr01)
**	    Add mct_acc_plv for supporting different page accessor function.
**	22-nov-1996 (nanpr01)
**	    Add mct_ver_number for loading data with appropriate version 
**	    number.
**      10-mar-1997 (stial01)
**          Added mct_crecord, a buffer to use for compression
**      07-Dec-1998 (stial01)
**          Added mct_kperleaf to distinguish from mct_kperpage
**      12-apr-1999 (stial01)
**          Different att/key info in DM2U_M_CONTEXT for (btree) 
**          LEAF vs. INDEX pages
**      23-oct-2000 (stial01)
**          Variable Page Size - Variable Page Type support (SIR 102955)
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**      10-feb-2004 (stial01)
**          Support for 256K rows, rows spanning pages.
**      12-oct-2009 (stial01)
**          Use DMPP_PAGE for all page types.
**      24-nov-2009 (stial01)
**          Added mct_seg_rows

** Name: DM2U_M_CONTEXT - Context block used by modify.
**
** Description:
**      This typedef is used by the modify dmu to keep context
**      between calls to the lower level routines which are 
**      building the new table one record at a time.  The 
**      normal high level put routines are not used to provide
**      for a more efficient method of restructuring tables.
**      Since this context is used by all access methods, it
**      contains many entries which may be ignored by any
**      one access method.
**
** History:
**     27-jan-1986 (Jennifer)
**          Created new for Jupiter.
**	19-aug-1991 (bryanp)
**	    Added new fields to support Btree Index Compression: mct_index_comp,
**	    mct_index_atts, mct_index_attcount. We need attribute information
**	    and a count of the number of attributes in order to pass to the
**	    compression routine, and we need to know what type of index
**	    compression (if any) is in effect.
**	    We use mct_index_maxlen to determine the worst case length of an
**	    entry on a page, to determine when a Btree index page is full.
**	20-aug-1991 (bryanp)
**	    Removed mct_parent. It's obsolete in 6.5.
**	30-jan-1992 (bonobo)
**	    Removed the redundant typedef to quiesce the ANSI C 
**	    compiler warnings.
**	10-mar-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Added new fields for in-memory builds.
**    	05-jun-1992 (kwatts)
**          Added mct_acc_tlv to DM2U_M_CONTEXT and changed mct_atts_ptr
**          to mct_data_atts and gave one more level of indirection for
**          new compression interface that bryanp first introduced.
**	29-August-1992 (rmuth)
**	    New build code add mct_lastused_data,mct_fhdr_pageno and
**	    mct_last_dpage removed mct_fmapnext and mct_fhdrnext.
**	30-October-1992 (rmuth)
**	    Add flag mct_guarantee_on_disk to the mct control_block.
**	26-jul-1993 (bryanp)
**	    Replace all uses of DM_LKID with LK_LKID.
**	06-mar-1996 (stial01 for bryanp)
**	    Add mct_page_size to hold the page size for build routines.
**	06-may-1996 (nanpr01)
**	    Add mct_acc_plv for supporting different page accessor function.
**	22-nov-1996 (nanpr01)
**	    Add mct_ver_number for loading data with appropriate version 
**	    number.
**	06-Jan-2004 (jenjo02)
**	    Added mct_tidsize, mct_partno for Global Indexes.
**	28-Feb-2004 (jenjo02)
**	    Deleted some unused defines, fields, realigned stuff
**	    to make it easier on the eyes.
**	12-Aug-2004 (schka24)
**	    Build data structure cleanup: delete unused members.
**	13-Apr-2006 (jenjo02)
**	    Add mct_cx_ixkey_atts, mct_clustered for CLUSTERED
**	    primary Btree tables.
**	24-Feb-2008 (kschendel) SIR 122739
**	    Reflect the new row-accessor scheme in the MCT.
