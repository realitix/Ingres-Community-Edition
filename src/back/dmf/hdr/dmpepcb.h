** Description:
**      This file contains the definition for the peripheral control block and

**
** History:
**      02-Jan-1990 (fred)
**          Created.
**	06-mar-1996 (stial01 for bryanp)
**	    Made component size dependent on DB_MAXSTRING rather than
**		DB_MAXTUP since the maximum row size may significantly differ
**		from the maximum column size.
**      27-mar-2000 (stial01)
**          Added pcb_att_id
**	08-mar-2001 (somsa01)
**	    DB_MAXSTRING has increased to 32K, but the segment length is
**	    still 2K. Thus, changed component size such that is is dependent
**	    on a hard value of 2K.
**      08-Oct-2002 (hanch04)
**          Replace the i4 for length with a SIZE_TYPE (size_t) to allow
**          64-bit memory allocation.
**      05-Aug-2005 (hanje04)
**          Back out change 478041 as it should never have been X-integrated
**          into main in the first place.
**      07-Jan-2011 (stial01) (b124871)
**          Add fields to DMPE_PCB for buffered segment puts and also for
**          etab full-nextchain-fixup handling.
**      03-Jun-2011 (maspa05) b123897
**          define DMPE_SEGMENT_LENGTH in terms of ULF_BLOB_SEGMENT_LENGTH 
**          (from ulf.h) so that we can define an SC930 buffer in terms of it

** Name: DMPE_PCB - Peripheral Control Block
**
** Description:
**	The PCB holds the DMF information that's needed during a single
**	Peripheral Operation (POP).  (e.g. one complete get, put, etc.)
**	POP's may take multiple stages, thus multiple trips through dmpe.
**	The PCB is what remembers things like the etab DMR_CB and
**	DMT_CB for the duration of the operation.
**
**	A PCB is usually allocated (dmpe_allocate) at the start of a POP
**	when dmpe sees the ADP_C_BEGIN_MASK flag, and is deallocated at
**	the end of the POP, or by an explicit ADP_CLEANUP call if
**	a filter function ends the POP prematurely (before processing
**	all segments).  The exception happens when a PUT POP is bulk-loading
**	one or more etabs;  in order to keep the etabs being loaded open
**	for the duration of the load (which might cover many POP's),
**	it turns out to be convenient to find and re-use the PCB
**	and its attached DMR/DMT CB's for as long as the bulk-load lasts.
**	The DMP_ET_LIST entry for any etab being bulk-loaded will point to
**	the PCB driving the bulk-load.  (Multiple DMP_ET_LIST entries
**	might point to the same PCB if we had to fill multiple etabs.)
**
**	Note that all phases of one POP take place within a single
**	thread, and hence uses that thread's transaction context.
**	This is different from the situation with a coupon.  A coupon
**	can be passed from thread to thread in a parallel query, and
**	so the coupon may only contain thread- and open-instance-independent
**	stuff (e.g. base table and attribute ID numbers; see dmpepcn.h).
**
** History:
**      02-Jan-1990 (fred)
**          Created.
**	05-nov-1993 (smc)
**          Bug #58635
**          Made l_reserved & owner elements PTR for consistency with
**	    DM_SVCB.
**	24-mar-99 (stephenb)
**	    Add pcb_fblk to contain the function index for the function that
**	    can be used to coerce the passed data into the target etab field
**	    Also add pcb_base_dmtcb to hold the table CB for the base table
**	7-May-2004 (schka24)
**	    Because of parallel query, various stages in the life of a
**	    coupon can't expect the same RCB.  Change base-rcb ptr to
**	    base-TCB pointer.  Add comments based on my current, perhaps
**	    defective, understanding...
**	15-Aug-2005 (jenjo02)
**	    Implement multiple DMF LongTerm memory pools and
**	    ShortTerm session memory.
**	    Define PCB_CB as DM_PCB_CB.
**	16-Apr-2010 (kschendel) SIR 123485
**	    Delete pcb-base-dmt stuff, add "did we fix tcb" bool.
**	    Add row counts and "held" record to fix bug with bulk loading
**	    etabs (wasn't checking for an etab being full).
