/**
** Name: DM0PBMCB.H - Buffer manager internal definitions.
**
** Description:
**      This file defines types and constants that are internal to the buffer
**	buffer.  These constants are located here so that debugging code can
**	get access to the structures.
**
** History:
**      06-dec-1985 (derek)
**          Created new for Jupiter.
**      04-apr-87 (ac)
**	    Added definition of read/nolock support.
**	30-sep-88 (rogerk)
**	    Added new fields to the buffer manager control block for
**	    write behind support.
**	30-jan-89 (rogerk)
**	    Added support for Shared Memory Buffer Manager.
**	    Changed pointers stored in buffer manager to be index values.
**	    Broke BMCB into two control blocks, BMCB and LBMCB.
**	    Added DM0P_BMCACHE definition.
**	    Added new DM0P_BUFFER, DM0P_GROUP and DM0P_BMCB fields.
**	10-apr-89 (rogerk)
**	    Added bm_name field to bmcb to hold cache name.
**	10-jul-89 (rogerk)
**	    Added BUF_EXTENDPAGE buffer status to fix multi-server extend bug.
**	25-sep-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added BM_PASS_ABORT to bm_status.
**	14-aug-90 (rogerk)
**	    Added buf_tcb_stamp field to DM0P_BUFFER struct.
**	29-apr-1991 (Derek)
**	    Added new buf_sts constants to DM0P_BUFFER for allocation project.
**	17-oct-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Great Merge of DMF : Move 6.4 changes into 6.5 line.
**
**	    4-feb-1991 (rogerk)
**		Added support for fixed buffer priorities.
**	 3-nov-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Added fixes for File Extend recovery.
**	    Added buffer status PAUNFIX which allows us to tell whether the
**	    WUNFIX condition of a buffer is because of the type of buffer or
**	    because a pass-abort operation is in progress.  This tells us
**	    whether we can reset the WUNFIX status after the pass-abort is
**	    complete.
**      6-jan-1992 (jnash)
**          Remove BM_PAUNFIX, add BM_TUNFIX in modifying File Extend and
**          Btree index page pass abort recovery.

**          Prototyping DMF.
**	26-oct-1992 (rogerk)
**	    Reduced Logging Project:  Added buffer manager fields for the
**	    transaction context used to force the log file.
**	    Added BUF_WCOMMIT flag and removed old BUF_FORCE_COMMIT.
**	24-feb-1993 (keving)
**	    => Added changes to allow a buffer manager to work with 
**	    => multiple logs
**	18-oct-1993 (rmuth)
**	    Collect BM statistics within the DMP_BMCB. This is usefull
**	    in a shared cache environment in non-shared cache they will
**	    be the same as DMP_LBMCB.
**	22-feb-1994 (andys)
**	    Integrate change from ingres63p:
**       	3-may-1993 (andys)
**          	    Add BUF_MUTEX_OK as part of fix for bug 46951.

**	    Added BUF_FCWAIT and appropriate statistic for its wait event.
**      06-mar-1996 (stial01)
**          Changes to support multiple page sizes.
**          Split DMP_BMCB into DM0P_BMCB, DM0P_BM_COMMON
**          Changed DMP_LBMCB, made some fields arrays.

**          lbm_dmcm_lock_list.
**          Added ANB's asyncio amendments.
**          Incorporate ITB's gather-write changes.
**          Added NO_ACTION to the list of async I/O actions and a
**          buffer flag to indicate a gather write has been queued.
**	    Added WRITE_ALONG flag so that dm0p_write_along can
**	    do gather writes.
**	30-Aug-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Mutex granularity project. Added a host of new mutexes
**	    to replace singular bmcb_mutex.
**          Defined new structure to contain BM semaphores, DM0P_SEMAPHORE.
**	    New "head-of-list" structures defined, DM0P_BID_HEAD, DM0P_STATE_HEAD,
**	    DM0P_HASH_HEAD.

**	    Added G_WAIT to group status flags..
**	24-Feb-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Removed bm_eq from BMCB. It served no purpose.
**	14-Mar-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Added G_RBUSY, G_BUSY to group status flags.
**	    Reinstated lbm_lxid_mutex.
**	24-Mar-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Table priority project:
**	    Replace BMCB_MAX_PRI with widely known DB_MAX_TABLEPRI.
**	    Removed bmcb_tblpsize, bmcb_tblpriority, lbm_tblpriority.

**	    Removed BUF_MUSTLOCK status bit, buf_pid.
**	01-May-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Added new stats for group waits.
**      21-May-1997 (stial01)
**          Renamed BUF_X_LATCH -> BUF_IX_LOCK. This is set when the buffer
**          has been fixed for write with an IX lock.
**          Added buf_lock_list to buffer, added BUF_MLOCK status.
**      29-May-1997 (stial01)
**          Change buf_sts to u_i4, Rename BUF_IX_LOCK -> BUF_INTENT_LK.
**	21-Nov-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Removed single (bm_fq) and group (bm_gfq) buffer fixed state queues.
**	19-Jan-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Renamed DM0P_TRQ to DM0P_BLQ to make it more generic. Added
**	    bmcb_tabq_buckets (table hash queues) in which BUF_VALID pages
**	    of a table are remembered.
**	20-May-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Dynamic, cache-specific WriteBehind thread alterations.
**	01-Sep-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Moved mutex wait stats out bmcb/lbm in to DM0P_BSTAT where they
**	    can be tracked by cache.
**	27-Apr-1999 (jenjo02)
**	  o Replaced i4 buf_index with DM0P_BID buf_id to ease cross-cache 
**	    identification. buf_id contains both the cache and buffer indexes
**	    to completely identify a buffer.
**	  o Added buf_cp_next to link CP candidate buffers across caches.
**	  o Added buf_page_offset so it doesn't have to be constantly
**	    computed.
**	  o Added bmcb_cp_next, bmcb_cpbufs to link CP candidate buffers 
**	    across caches.
**	29-Jun-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Changes necessary to implement GatherWrite.
**	12-Jul-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Replaced CP queue with array of buffer BIDs to pre-sort
**	    CP buffers.
**	24-Aug-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Added 2 new buf_type values, BMCB_FHDR, BMCB_FMAP, previously 
**	    indistinguishable from BMCB_ROOT.
**	    Added cache stats by buf_type to DM0P_BSTAT. Added
**	    2 new stats, bs_reclaim (number of reclaims of BUF_FREE buffers) and
**	    bs_replace (reclaim of BUF_VALID free or modified buffer). Fixed-priority
**	    stats removed. Added sth_count to DM0P_STATE_HEAD, obviating the need
**	    for bm_gfcount and bm_gmcount.
**	10-Jan-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Implemented group priority queues. Changed some buffer/group/bm
**	    variables to volatile to keep unmutexed list scans from being
**	    over-optimized by compilers.
**	    Inlined CSp|v_semaphore function calls within dm0p_mlock|munlock
**	    macros. dm0p_mlock|munlock_fcn() is called only if the inlined
**	    semaphore request fails (to trap the error).
**	    Got rid of static bm_fcount, lcount, mcount, state queue counts
**	    and contentious bm_count_mutex. New macros DM0P_COUNT_? will
**	    tally the counts when needed.
**	20-Apr-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Moved CACHENAME_SUFFIX, CACHENM_MAX defines here from dm0p.c for
**	    exposure in cacheutil.c. Single cross-cache CP array changed to
**	    per-cache arrays.
**	23-May-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Added temporary bms_line to semaphore structure, modified
**	    semaphore macros to store line number of last p|v_sem to
**	    help track any elusive mutex errors.
**	22-Sep-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Added g_lock_list to identify who set BUSY status.
**      23-oct-2000 (stial01)
**          Variable Page Size - Variable Page Type support (SIR 102955)
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**      19-Jun-2002 (horda03) Bug 108074
**          Prevent FORCE_ABORT transaction filling TX log
**          file by not flushing SCONCUR pages unless we
**          really need to. Added BUF_WUNFIX_REQ.
**      20-aug-2002 (devjo01)
**          Added BMCL_DCMC_CBACK.
**      08-Oct-2002 (hanch04)
**          Replace the i4 for length with a SIZE_TYPE (size_t) to allow
**          64-bit memory allocation.
**      08-Oct-2002 (hanch04)
**          Replace the i4 for length with a SIZE_TYPE (size_t) to allow
**          64-bit memory allocation.
**      23-Oct-2002 (hanch04)
**          Changed page_offset to SIZE_TYPE to support
**          buffer manager cache > 2 gig.
**	31-Jan-2003 (jenjo02)
**	    Changes for Cache Flush Agent concepts.
**	29-Mar-2004 (hanje04)
**	    Redefine BMCB_CLUSTERED to be 0x0100 to stop it clashing with
**	    BMCB_CFA_TRACE.
**	01-apr-2004 (devjo01)
**	    Add BMCB_USE_CLM.  Flag indicate a fast Cluster Long Message
**	    facility is available.
**	09-Apr-2004 (hanje04)
**	    Removed >> integration tags.
**	3-May-2005 (schka24)
**	    Set mutex hint after taking the actual mutex, not before.
**      05-Aug-2005 (hanje04)
**          Back out change 478041 as it should never have been X-integrated
**          into main in the first place.
**	28-nov-2005 (devjo01) b115583
**	    Add buf_pid, lbm_pid for use in VMS clusters.
**	04-Apr-2008 (jonj)
**	    Add BMCB_PAGE_TYPES define.
**	15-Mar-2010 (smeke01) b119529

** Name: DM0P_BUFFER - Internal structure of a buffer descriptor.
**
** Description:
**      This structure is used internally by the buffer manager to maintain
**	information about the use of a page by a transaction.  If the page
**	is not currently being used by a transaction, it can still have
**	valid contents.  The external caller has a truncated view of the
**	buffer descriptor.  This allows for a thin wall of protection between
**	the buffer manager and the caller.
**
**	The buffer status indicators mean the following:
**
**	    BUF_FREE			The buffer is on
**					the priority zero free queue.
**	    BUF_VALID			The buffer has legal contents and is on
**					the hash queue.
**	    BUF_FIXED			The buffer is fixed and on
**					the hash queue.
**	    BUF_MODIFIED		The buffer has legal contents, needs to
**					be written to disk, in on the hash queue
**					and on the modified priority queue if
**					not also BUF_FIXED.
**	    BUF_WRITE			The buffer is being accessed for write.
**					Only valid if BUF_FIXED is set.
**	    BUF_LOCKED			The buffer has a cache lock set.
**	    BUF_CACHED			The buffer is locked in null mode on the
**					hash queue and the free priority queue.
**	    BUF_RBUSY			The buffer has a READ I/O is progress.
**	    BUF_WBUSY			The buffer has a WRITE I/O is progress.
**	    BUF_TEMP_FIXED
**	    BUF_RECLAIM			Free or modified buffer is being reclaimed
**					for use by fault_page().
**	    BUF_INVALID			The buffer has encountered an I/O or lock
**					error.  This flag is only cleared by
**					dm0p_invalidate, dm0p_tran_invalidate,
**					or dm0p_force_pages.  Thus this page
**					cannot be accessed until the transaction
**					is aborted.
**	    BUF_MUTEX			A transaction currently holds a mutex on
**					this page.
**	    BUF_MWAIT			Some number of transactions are waiting
**					for the mutex.
**	    BUF_IOWAIT			Some number of transactions are waiting
**					for I/O to complete.
**	    BUF_FCWAIT			Threads are waiting for FCBUSY to go.
**	    BUF_MUSTLOCK		Flag used by group read code to 
**					determine whether a lock is required 
**					and whether the lock has been granted 
**					when recoverying from errors.
**	    BUF_FCBUSY			The buffer is in use by the fast commit
**					thread and cannot be changed or tossed.
**	    BUF_WCOMMIT			Write to disk on COMMIT.
**	    BUF_WUNFIX			Write to disk on UNFIX. May be cleared
**                                      if page protected by table X lock.
**          BUF_WUNFIX_REQ              Write to disk on UNFIX.
**	    BUF_PAWRITE			Write to disk when pass abort signaled.
**          BUF_TUNFIX                  Toss buffer on UNFIX - used in PASS
**                                      ABORT protocols.
**	    BUF_NOTXLOCK		Page is not locked by the transaction.
**	    BUF_PRIOFIX			The buffer's priority should remain
**					fixed.  It should not be decremented
**					over time, nor incremented on reference.
**	    BUF_MUTEX_OK		Buffer is mutexed while it is being 
**			                forced in dm0p_close_page.
**	    BUF_HI_TPRIO		Something to do with readahead.
**          BUF_NULL_TUNFIX             Used for DMCM. System catalogs are 
**                                      tossed and their locks converted to
**                                      NULL at the end of transaction.
**          BUF_DMCM                    Used to indicate that the buffer is
**                                      participating in the DMCM protocol.
**          BUF_INTENT_LK               Buffer is locked with INTENT lock.
**	    BUF_TEMPTABLE		Page in buffer belongs to a temporary
**					table.
**	    BUF_WBBUSY			The buffer is being readied to be forced
**					by a WriteBehind thread.
**	    BUF_GW_QUEUED		Buffer is scheduled for GatherWrite.
**
**	The buf_tcb_stamp holds the TCB validation stamp (obtained from a
**	tcb lock value) of the buffer's parent table.  This is written in
**	the buffer header when a page is faulted into the cache.  When the
**	buffer manager decides to toss a random page from the cache, it uses
**	this value to make sure that the TCB it has is the correct version.
**	It is possible that the table has been modified by another server
**	connected to the same cache and that we are holding an old version
**	of the TCB.
**
** History:
**     14-oct-1985 (derek)
**          Created new for Jupiter.
**     30-mar-1987 (ac)
**          Added read/nolock support.
**     30-jan-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Changed pointers to be indexes into buffer pool to make the
**	    Buffer Manager position independent.  Took out buf_tcb pointer and
**	    replaced with buf_tabid.  Added buf_index, buf_dbid, buf_cpcount,
**	    buf_hash_bucket, buf_tr_bucket fields.  Took out buf_newvalue.
**	10-jul-89 (rogerk)
**	    Added BUF_EXTENDPAGE buffer status to fix multi-server extend bug.
**	    We won't force buffer in fast commit thread that is marked
**	    BUF_EXTENDPAGE.  Newly allocated pages are marked BUF_EXTENDPAGE
**	    until they are forced to disk.
**	14-aug-90 (rogerk)
**	    Added buf_tcb_stamp field (used one of the pad fields).  Used to
**	    verify TCB's when a page needs to be tossed from a shared cache.
**	    The TCB's validation stamp is written here when a page is faulted
**	    into the cache.
**	29-apr-1991 (Derek)
**	    Added new buf_sts constants NOTXLOCK,WUNFIX,PAWRITE.
**	17-oct-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Great Merge of DMF : Move 6.4 changes into 6.5 line.
**
**	    4-feb-1991 (rogerk)
**		Added support for fixed buffer priorities.
**	 3-nov-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Added fixes for File Extend recovery.
**	    Added buffer status PAUNFIX which allows us to tell whether the
**	    WUNFIX condition of a buffer is because of the type of buffer or
**	    because a pass-abort operation is in progress.  This tells us
**	    whether we can reset the WUNFIX status after the pass-abort is
**	    complete.
**      6-jan-1992 (jnash)
**          Remove BM_PAUNFIX, add BM_TUNFIX in modifying File Extend and
**          Btree index page pass abort recovery.
**	26-oct-1992 (rogerk)
**	    Added WCOMMIT flag and removed FORCE_COMMIT.
**	29-feb-96 (nick)
**	    Added BUF_FCWAIT.
**      01-aug-96 (nanpr01 for ICL phil.p)
**          Added buf_lock_mode for use by the Distributed Multi-Cache
**          Management Protocol. Each time a succesful cache lock
**          request is made, the mode is copied into this field; so that 
**          we always know the mode at which a cached page is locked.
**          Added pid for use by the DMCM protocol. When a server makes a
**          lock request providing a callback, the servers process id is
**          stored in the buffer. This enables us to make a sensible
**          decision about buffers when this server is shut down.
**          Added buffer statuses BUF_NULL_TUNFIX and BUF_DMCM.
**	13-Sep-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Added buf_mutex.
**      22-nov-96 (dilma04)
**          Row Locking Project:
**          Added BUF_X_LATCH.
**	24-Mar-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Table priority project:
**	    Removed BUF_MUSTLOCK status bit, buf_pid.
**      25-apr-97 (stial01)
**          Added buf_lock_list, Renamed BUF_X_LATCH, BUF_IX_LOCK.
**          Added BUF_MLOCK_LIST: If set, only buf_lock_list or the 
**          buffer manager can mutex the buffer.
**	26-Mar-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Renamed obsolete BUF_EXTENDPAGE to BUF_TEMPTABLE. 
**	27-Apr-1999 (jenjo02)
**	  o Replaced i4 buf_index with DM0P_BID buf_id to ease cross-cache 
**	    identification. buf_id contains both the cache and buffer indexes
**	    to completely identify a buffer.
**	  o Added buf_cp_next to link CP candidate buffers across caches.
**	  o Added buf_page_offset so it doesn't have to be constantly
**	    computed.
**	12-Jul-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Removed buf_cp_next.
**	10-Jan-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Made buf_sts, buf_priority volatile.
**      19-Jun-2002 (horda03) Bug 108074.
**          Added BUF_WUNFIX_REQ. This indicates that the buffer
**          should normally be writen to disk on UNFIX (BUF_WUNFIX).
**          But to prevent FORCE_ABORT filling TX log file, the
**          BUF_WUNFIX flag will be cleared if the page is protected
**          by an X table level lock.
**	31-Jan-2003 (jenjo02)
**	    Added buf_cpfcb abstraction for cp_sort().
**	18-Aug-2003 (devjo01)
**	    When crossing fix for 108074 to main, recycled bit for
**	    BUF_TEMP_FIXED into BUF_WUNFIX_REQ.  BUF_TEMP_FIXED was
**	    set but never checked, and all 32 bits are in use!
**      18-Sep-2003 (jenjo02) SIR 110923
**          Added buf_fp_action, buf_fp_llid in support of 
**          GatherWrite, complete_f_p() use by groups.
**	01-Mar-2004 (jenjo02)
**	    Added buf_partno for pages from Partitions.
**	27-Apr-2005 (schka24)
**	    Make buf_hash_bucket volatile since it's set unmutexed for groups.
**	11-Sep-2006 (jonj)
**	    Add buf_log_id, the log handle under which the buffer
**	    was put on the transaction queue, used by dm0p_force_pages().
**	10-Oct-2007 (jonj)
**	    Add BUF_STS define, finally.
**	15-Jan-2010 (jonj)
**	    SIR 121619 MVCC: Add buf_page_lsn, buf_page_tranid,
**	    buf_cr_root, buf_cr_next, buf_cr_prev, buf_cr_iso, buf_cr_noundo,
**	    buf_create, buf_pincount, buf_mpend.
**	29-Jun-2010 (jonj)
**	    Added buf_cr_undo, buf_cr_where to aid debugging.
**	18-Apr-2010 (wanfr01) b123594
**	    Added buf_cpprep

** Name: DM0P_BMCACHE - Database or Table cache entry.
**
** Description:
**      This structure is used internally by the buffer manager to maintain
**	information about databases and tables that have cached pages in the
**	buffer manager.
**
**	The cache entries are used for performance reasons only.  Pages can
**	exist in the buffer cache that do not have a corresponding entry in
**	the database or table cache list.
**
**	The cache entries are used by the buffer manager to enable it to
**	keep pages cached for tables and databases that are not open by
**	any sessions connected to the buffer manager.  Each cache entry has
**	a lock that is maintained on the buffer manager lock list.  The locks
**	values are checked at database or table open time to tell if the
**	cached pages for that database or table are still valid.
**
**	The cache entries are kept in an LRU list.  Each time a new descriptor
**	is needed, the least recently used entry is tossed out (meaning that
**	the next time that database/table is opened, all corresponding pages
**	will be tossed from the cache).

** Name: DM0P_BMCB - Buffer manager control block.
**
** Description:
**      This control block contains the cache specific information needed
**      to manage the flow of buffer from disk to memory and back.
**
**	This control block is placed into shared memory in installations
**	where servers share common buffer managers.
**
**	This control block and corresponding buffer descriptors and pages
**	are referenced through the Local Buffer Manager Control Block.
**
** History:
**     15-oct-1985 (derek)
**          Created new for Jupiter.
**     30-sep-1988 (rogerk)
**	    Added bm_wbstart, bm_wbend, bm_wbflush, bm_fcflush fields.
**	    Added BM_WBWAIT and BM_FCFLUSH flags for write behind threads.
**     20-jan-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Made Buffer Manager position independent for shared memory.
**	    Broke up into BMCB and LBMCB (local bmcb).
**	    Added database and table cache arrays.
**	    Added fields: bm_id, bm_lock_identifier, bm_srv_count, bm_cpcount,
**	    bm_cpindex, bm_cpcheck, bm_dbclist, bm_tblclist, bm_dbcsize,
**	    bm_tblcsize.
**     10-apr-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added bm_name field to hold buffer manager name.
**     25-sep-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added BM_PASS_ABORT, BM_PREPASS_ABORT to bm_status.
**	17-oct-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Great Merge of DMF : Move 6.4 changes into 6.5 line.
**
**	     4-feb-1991 (rogerk)
**		Added support for fixed buffer priorities.
**		Added bm_tblpsize and bm_tblpindex fields.
**	24-feb-1993 (keving)
**	    => Added changes to allow a buffer manager to work with 
**	    => multiple logs
**	18-oct-1993 (rmuth)
**	    Collect BM statistics within the DMP_BMCB. This is usefull
**	    in a shared cache environment in non-shared cache they will
**	    be the same as DMP_LBMCB.
**	05-nov-1993 (smc)
**          Bug #58635
**          Made l_reserved & owner elements PTR for consistency with DM_SVCB.
**	03-dec-93 (swm)
**          Bug #58635
**	    Changed bm_1_reserved, bm_2_reserved in DMP_BMCB from i4 to
**	    i4 * for consistency with DM_SVCB.
**	19-apr-1995 (cohmi01)
**	    Add BM_BATCHMODE indicator for bm_status.
**	10-may-1995 (cohmi01)
**	    Move batchmode indicator to svcb, instead of BM. Added
**	    BM_IOMASTER indicator, means an IOMASTER server is attached to BM.
**	24-oct-1995 (thaju02/stoli02)
**	    Added bm_syncwr and bm_gsyncrwr forced synchronous writes counters.
**      06-mar-1996 (stial01)
**          Modified for multiple page sizes:
**          Moved page size independent fields into DM0P_BM_COMMON
**      01-aug-1996 (nanpr01 for ICL phil.p)
**          Introduced field bm_dmcm. When deallocating a buffer manager
**          we need to know if it supports the Distributed Multi-Cache
**          Management (DMCM) protocol.
**	13-Sep-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Changed bm_fq, bm_gfq, bm_eq, bm_geq, bm_gmq, 
**	    bm_fpq, bm_mpq to type DM0P_STATE_HEAD.
**	    Added bm_clock_mutex, bm_count_mutex.
**	24-Feb-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Removed bm_eq from BMCB. It served no purpose.
**	24-Mar-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Table priority project:
**	    Replace BMCB_MAX_PRI with widely known DB_MAX_TABLEPRI.
**	21-Nov-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Removed single (bm_fq) and group (bm_gfq) buffer fixed state queues.
**	20-May-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Cache-specific WriteBehind thread additions.
**	    Added bm_cache_ix, bm_gwbstart, bm_gwbend, bm_wb_mutex,
**	    bm_wb_thread_start, bm_wb_thread_end, BM_WBWAIT,
**	    BM_WB_IN_CACHE.
**	24-Aug-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Removed bm_gfcount, bm_gmcount, sth_count used instead.
**	10-Jan-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Added group priority queues.
**	    Removed bm_fcount, bm_mcount, bm_lcount, bm_gfcount, bm_gmcount,
**	    bm_glcount, bm_count_mutex.
**	15-Nov-2002 (jenjo02)
**	    Renamed bm_wb_mutex to bm_mutex to generically protect 
**	    all non-statics in BMCB, including bm_status and WB variables.
**	31-Jan-2003 (jenjo02)
**	    Added bm_cpagents, bm_cpabufs, bm_cfa_mask,
**	    BM_WB_SINGLE, BM_WB_GROUP, BM_WB_CP (reason Primary
**	    Agent was signalled).
**	04-Apr-2008 (jonj)
**	    Add BM_STATUS define.

** Name: DMP_LBMCB - Local buffer manager control block.
**
** Description:
**	This control block contains buffer manager information that
**	is local to one server, rather than what can be shared across
**	multiple servers.
**
**	All pointers to Buffer Manager structures that can be kept in
**	shared memory should be referenced through this control block.
**
**	The local buffer manager control block is linked off of the
**	DMF server control block.
**
** History:
**     20-jan-1989 (rogerk)
**          Created new for Terminator.
**	17-oct-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Great Merge of DMF : Move 6.4 changes into 6.5 line.
**
**	     4-feb-1991 (rogerk)
**		Added support for fixed buffer priorities.
**		Added lbm_tblpriority cache.
**	26-oct-1992 (rogerk)
**	    Reduced Logging Project:  Added buffer manager fields for the
**	    transaction context used to force the log file.
**	05-nov-1993 (smc)
**          Bug #58635
**          Made l_reserved & owner elements PTR for consistency with DM_SVCB.
**	03-dec-93 (swm)
**          Bug #58635
**	    Changed lbm_1_reserved, lbm_2_reserved in DMP_BMCB from i4 to
**	    i4 * for consistency with DM_SVCB.
**      06-mar-1996 (stial01)
**          Modified in support of variable page sizes.
**	25-mar-96 (nick)
**	    Added lbm_fcwait.
**      01-aug-1996 (nanpr01 for ICL phil.p)
**          Added lbm_dmcm_lock_list.
**          For support of the Distributed Multi-Cache Management (DMCM)
**          protocol, this lock list is used for forcing pages in the DMCM
**          callback routine dm0p_dmcm_callback.
**	13-Sep-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Changed lbm_buckets to type DM0P_HASH_HEAD.
**	14-Mar-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Reinstated lbm_lxid_mutex.
**	24-Mar-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Table priority project:
**	    Removed lbm_tblpriority.
**	    Changed stat fields to u_i4.
**	01-Sep-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Moved mutex wait stats out bmcb/lbm in to DM0P_BSTAT where they
**	    can be tracked by cache.
**	29-Jun-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Added GatherWrite-specific elements.
**	12-Jul-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Added lbm_cp_array, used to pre-sort CP-eligible buffers.
**	15-Aug-2005 (jenjo02)
**	    Implement multiple DMF LongTerm memory pools and
**	    ShortTerm session memory.
**	    Define LBMCB_CB as DM_LBMCB_CB.

** Name: DMP_BMSCB - Buffer Manager Segment control block.
**
** Description:
**
**      This control block is the first control block in Buffer Manager 
**      memory segments. Note that multiple pieces of memory are allocated
**      when the installation is configured with multiple buffer caches that
**      are to be allocated separately. The BMSCB contains the offsets 
**      to interesting sections of buffer manager memory allocated contiguous
**      with the BMSCB.
**
**	This control block is placed into shared memory in installations
**	where servers share common buffer managers.
**
**	This control block and corresponding buffer descriptors and pages
**	are referenced through the Local Buffer Manager Control Block.
**
** History:
**     06-mar-1996 (stial01)
**          Created to support of multiple caches in multiple memory segments.
**	08-Jul-1999 (jenjo02)

**	    bms_cp_array.
**	15-Aug-2005 (jenjo02)
**	    Implement multiple DMF LongTerm memory pools and
