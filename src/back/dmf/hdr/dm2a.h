**	DM2A.H	Definitions for Aggregate Processor
**
** Description:
**	This file contains definitions used by the DM2A.C aggregate
**	processor, for execution of those aggregates that QEF sees
**	fit to pass of to DMF.
**
** History:
**	04-sep-1995 (cohmi01)
**	    Added, for aggregate optimization project.
**	30-jul-96 (nick)
**	    Add function prototypes.
**	11-Feb-1997 (nanpr01)
**	    Bug 80636 : Pass the QEF_ADF_CB for proper initialization.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	11-Apr-2008 (kschendel)
**	    Remove QEF exception handler from call sequence.
**	01-Dec-2008 (jonj)
**	    SIR 120874: dm2a_? functions converted to DB_ERROR *

** Aggregate Limit Indicators
**
** These bits indicate which of the 'dmf-optimizable' aggregates have
** been specified in this request. There must be code in the ADE_EXCB block
** passed in from QEF that must correspond to these requests, except in
** the case of count. The presence of any of these bits means that NO OTHER
** aggregates (eg SUM) are present in this request, and that DMF is
** therefore able to optimize where possible, to the extent of not even
** reading data, which would otherwise be necessary for processing any of
** the non-'dmf-optimizable' aggregates.
