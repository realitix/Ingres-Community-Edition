/**
** Name:  DMP.H - Typedefs for the physical layer of DMF.
**
** Description:
**      This file contains all the structs, typedefs, and symbolic constants
**      used by the physical layer of DMF.  The physical layer is resposible
**      for the access method dependent operations required to read and
**      write records on database pages.  It includes all locking and logging
**      services needed for concurrency and recovery. 
**
** History:
**      01-sep-85 (jennifer)
**         Created for Jupiter.
**      16-nov_87 (jennifer)
**         Added multi-location table support.
**	23-sep-88 (sandyh)
**	   Changed tcb_chr_atts_count to tcb_comp_atts_count for C & CHAR
**	30-sep-1988 (rogerk)
**	    Added rcb_hash_nofull field to keep track of the free space
**	    status on a hash overflow chain as the chain is traversed.
**	21-jan-1989 (mikem)
**	    Added DCB_NOSYNC_MASK.
**	 6-feb-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added dcb_bm_served field.  This describes whether the database
**	    can be served by one (DCB_SINGLE) or many (DCB_MULTIPLE) buffer
**	    managers.  Added tcb_status field to DMP_TCB. This is set to BUSY
**	    while the tcb is being built.
**	06-mar-89 (neil)
**          Rules: Added TCB_RULE (for table) and ATT_RULE (for column).
**	10-apr-89 (mikem)
**          Logical key development.  Added tcb_{high,low}_logical_key fields
**	    to the DMP_TCB.  Added ATT_WORM and ATT_SYS_MAINTAINED.
**	    Added tcb_{high,low}_logical_key fields to keep track of an 8 
**	    byte unique id.  Also added a new relstat status bit: 
**	    TCB_SYS_MAINTAINED.
**	 2-may-89 (anton)
**	    local collation support
**      20-jun-89 (jennifer)
**          Security development.  Added TCB_SECURE to relstat bit.
**	15-aug-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added support for Non-SQL Gateways.
**	    Added new fields to TCB and RCB.
**	18-sep-89 (rogerk)
**	    Added dcb_lx_id to keep track of transaction for open database.
**	    This is added to avoid requiring an LGbegin call to close a
**	    database.
**	 6-dec-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added rcb_bt_bi_logging field to indicate that btree leaf pages
**	    should use Before Image logging.
**	29-sep-89 (rogerk)
**	    Added DCB_S_BACKUP status to DCB control block to indicate that
**	    database is undergoing online backup.
**	10-jan-90 (rogerk)
**	    Added DCB_S_OFFLINE_CSP status to show that the CSP has the
**	    database open during startup recovery.  Using this and the
**	    DCB_S_CSP (which is set during node failure) indicates whether
**	    the database is open by the CSP.
**	23-jan-1990 (fred)
**	    Added large object support to TCB's and RCB's.
**	24-sep-1990 (rogerk)
**	    Merged 6.3 changes into 6.5.
**	29-apr-1991 (Derek)
**	    Added new DMP_RELATION fields and RCB performance counters.
**	17-oct-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Great Merge of DMF : Move 6.4 changes into 6.5 line.
**
**	    19-nov-1990 (rogerk)
**		Added an ADF_CB to the Record Control Block.  This is now used
**		by DMF instead of allocated adf control blocks on the stack
**		when they are needed.  This makes it easier for DMF to keep
**		track of and set ADF variables associated with each session.
**		Added timezone value to the Database Control Block to make
**		it possible to attach timezone values to databases the same
**		way that collation sequences are handled.
**		This was done as part of the DBMS Timezone changes.
**	    17-dec-90 (jas)
**		Smart Disk project integration:
**		Add Smart Disk fields to RCB and TCB definitions.
**	     4-feb-1991 (rogerk)
**		Added support for fixed cache priorities.
**		Added tcb_bmpriority to show table's cache priority.
**	    12-feb-1991 (mikem)
**		Added two new fields rcb_val_logkey and rcb_logkey to DMP_RCB
**		structure to support returning logical key values to the client
**		which caused the insert of the tuple and thus caused them to be
**		assigned.
**	    25-mar-1991 (bryanp)
**		Added support for Btree Index Compression. Changes to the TCB:
**		    New field tcb_data_atts which points to list of pointers to
**		    attributes (i.e., it's equivalent to tcb_key_atts, but lists
**		    all data attributes) tcb_data_atts and tcb_key_atts are used
**		    when performing data or key compression, respectively.
**		    New relstat bit, TCB_INDEX_COMP, to indicate that table uses
**		    index compression.  New tcb_comp_katts_count field in TCB.
**	    23-jul-91 (markg)
**		Added new RCB_F_USER_ERROR return status for qualification
**		function in DMP_CB. (b38679)
**	    30-jan-1992 (bonobo)
**		Removed the redundant typedefs to quiesce the ANSI C 
**		compiler warnings.
**	18-feb-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Temporary table enhancements: Added TCB_PEND_DESTROY flag to TCB.
**	    Added fcb_mutex to DMP_FCB.
**	    Added FCB_DEFERRED_IO and FCB_MATERIALIZING flags to fcb_state.
**	08-may-1992 (ananth)
**	    Increasing IIrelation tuple size project.
**      26-may-92 (schang)
**          GW merge
**	18-apr-1991 (rickh)
**	    Documented the curious coincidence of RCB_USER_INTR and 
**	    SCB_USER_INTR.
**	28-jul-92 (rickh)
**	    FIPS CONSTRAINTS improvements.
**	31-aug-92 (kwatts)
**	    Added a DMP_INDEX_SIZE because 'sizeof(DMP_INDEX)' word aligns
**	    on Sun/DRS6000
**    	29-August-1992 (rmuth)
**          Removing on-the-fly 6.4->6.5 tab;e conversion means we can
**          remove TCB_FHDR_VALID.
**	05-oct-92 (rogerk)
**	    Reduced Logging Project:
**	    Added support for partial TCB's.  Added TCB_PARTIAL tcb status
**	    to indicate that a TCB may not have all its underlying files
**	    open and may not contain sufficient logical information to
**	    allow logical table access.
**	    Added new tcb_valid_count field to keep count of the number of
**	    tcb fixes which verified the correctness of the tcb at fix time.
**	    Created above mentioned DMP_TABLE_IO structure and added support
**	    to DMP_LOCATION's and DMP_FCB's for partially open tables.
**	    Added tcb_table_io control block which contains information
**	    necessary for IO operations.  Moved existing tcb_loc_count,
**	    tcb_location_array, tcb_lalloc, tcb_lpageno, tcb_bmpriority,
**	    tcb_checkeof and tcb_valid_stamp into the table_io control block.
**	    Added new tcb_valid_count field to keep count of the number of
**	    tcb fixes which verified the correctness of the tcb at fix time.
**	22-oct-92 (rickh)
**	    Excised DMP_ATTS.  All references to this structure have been
**	    replaced with references to the identical structure DB_ATTS.
**	    Moved _DMP_COLUMN to DMF.H, where it's now called _DM_COLUMN.
**	    This makes this structure visible to GWF so that facility
**	    doesn't have to declare its own field by field equivalent.
**	26-oct-92 (rogerk & jnash)
**	    Reduced Logging Project:  Added loc_config_id to dmp_location.
**	    Added new TCB status value TCB_CLOSE_ERROR.  Added system
**	    catalog page type TCB_PG_SYSCAT.
**	30-October-1992 (rmuth)
**	    - Change tbio_lpageno and tbio_lalloc to i4's so that
**	      we can initialise them to -1 which is an invalid pageno.
**	    - Add tbio_tmp_hw_pageno to track the the highest written
**	      pageno for a temp table to DMP_TABLE_IO.
**	05-nov-92 (jnash)
**	    Temp hack of recovery bitfield to bypass tid locking 
**	    until new recovery code integrated.
**	04-nov-92 (jrb)
**	    Changed DCB_SORT to DCB_WORK.
**	18-nov-92 (jnash)
**	    Reduced Logging Project (phase 2):
**	      - Add LOC_UNAVAIL to reflect locations that are not recovered.
**	      - Took out temporary use of rcb_recovery field.
**	      - Add rcb_usertab_jnl for system catalog rcbs to indicate the
**		journal status of the usertable being accessed.
**	05-dec-1992 (kwatts)
**	    Smart Disk enhancement, rcb_sdtsbbuffer becomes a char.
**	18-jan-1993 (bryanp)
**	    Added TCB_TMPMOD_WAIT to fix temporary table modify bug.
**	18-jan-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Reduced Logging Project (pase 3):  Additions to dcb status field.
**	16-feb-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Added tcb_open_count to count the number of open RCB's on the table.
**	15-mar-1993 (jnash)
**	    Reassign value of EXT_CB from 20 to 27 to eliminate duplicate.
**	15-mar-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Reduced Logging - Phase IV:
**	    Removed the rcb_abt_sp_addr field used when BI's were logged
**		for undo recovery.
**	    Removed obsolete rcb_bt_bi_logging and rcb_merge_logging fields.
**      26-apr-1993 (bryanp)
**          6.5 Cluster support:
**              Replace all uses of DM_LOG_ADDR with LG_LA or LG_LSN.
**		Add rcb_state flag RCB_IN_MINI_TRAN to allow tracking when a
**		    particular RCB is in the process of performing a mini-
**		    transaction.
**		Added dcb_backup_lsn so that we can track the Log Sequence
**		    Number of the start of the backup.
**		Remove the DCB_S_CSP status flag for a database, since we no
**		    longer need to know when a database is being processed by
**		    the CSP.
**		Added a dcb_add_count to track number of users who think they
**		    have added this database.
**	15-may-1993 (rmuth)
**	    Add relstat2 bits for the following:
**		- to indicate that a table is READONLY
**		- If table is an index to indicate that it is being built 
**		  in "CONCURRENT_ACCESS" mode.
**	   
**	26-jul-1993 (bryanp)
**	    The dcb_lx_id field is no longer needed, since we no longer log a
**		DM0L_CLOSEDB log record when closing a database.
**	    Replace all uses of DM_LKID with LK_LKID.
**	    Also, just a comment: sprinkled throughout this file are various
**		comments which attempt to describe, for each major control
**		block, the offset in bytes, in decimal, of that field in that
**		control block. While making the DM0L_CLOSEDB log record changes
**		I noticed that these fields have not been kept up to date; in
**		particular, the DB_MAXNAME change from 24-32 bytes in length
**		is not reflected in these comments. SO DO NOT TRUST THESE OFFSET
**		COMMENTS! Probably, we should just delete the comments, since
**		they're very hard to keep up to date.
**	23-aug-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Renamed DCB_S_RCP to DCB_S_ONLINE_RCP as it is set only when doing
**	    online recovery processing.
**	    Added definition for DCB_S_RECOVER.
**      18-oct-93 (jrb)
**          Added dcb_wrkspill_idx to DCB; MLSorts project.
**	18-oct-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Removed PEND_DESTROY tcb state.
**	18-oct-93 (swm)
**	    Added tcb_unique_id after standard DMF header, for use as a lock
**	    event value. This value is used instead of a DMP_TCB pointer
**	    because the size of a pointer can be bigger than the size of a
**	    u_i4 on some platforms.
**	    This field is currently unused, it has been added as a hook for
**	    my next integration.
**      19-oct-93 (tomm)
**	    remove erroneous comment fragment which caused syntax errors.
**	19-oct-93 (swm)
**	    Moved TCB_ASCII_ID define to immediately follow tcb_ascii_id
**	    field to which it relates, rather than tcb_unique_id.
**      27-sep-1993 (smc)
**          Removed byte offset comments as these were non-portable.
**	26-oct-93 (swm)
**	    Bug #56440
**	    Recently added tcb_unique_id field now in use.
**	20-jun-1994 (jnash)
**	    fsync project:
**	     - Add tbio_sync_close, used when building tcb to request async 
**	       writes and table force at dm2t_close.
**	     - Add DCB_S_SYNC_CLOSE dcb_status.  Database level sync-at-
**	       close, currently used only by rollforwarddb.  Generates
**	       table level sync-at-close open requests.
**           - Eliminate obsolete tcb_logical_log.
**      14-sep-1994 (andyw)

**          Added TCB2_PHYSLOCK_CONCUR - Table uses physical locks but is not
**          a TCB_CONCUR table. Implies that the table must remain hash

**          Note that dmt_set_lock_values uses the table id instead of relstat2 
**          since relstat2 is not available at the time. 
**          If you add a new table with this flag, or add this flag to an 
**          existing table, YOU MUST add equivalent checks in 
**          dmt_set_lock_values also. You'll also need to update/add to

**      07-Oct-2010 (horda03) b124559
**          When a DB was opened during Incremental Rollforward, the access_mode

**  DCB - SECTION
**
**       This section defines all structures needed to build
**       and access the information in a Database Control Block (DCB).
**       The following structs are defined:
**           
**           DMP_DCB                 Database Control Block.
*/

/*}
** Name:  DMP_DCB - DMF internal control block for static database information.
**
** Description:
**      This typedef defines the control block required to keep information
**      about databases that is independent of the opener.
**
**      Most of the information in the DCB comes from runtime information
**      provided on the call to DMF to add a database to the server and
**      from the database configuration file.  This control block varies in 
**      size for each database since any number of locations can be added 
**      by the owner.  The DCB includes such information as the pointers
**      to the TCB's for the primary system tables (i.e. RELATION, ATTRIBUTE,
**      and INDEX), the name and identifier of the log file associated with 
**      this database, a valid stamp used to determine if this copy of 
**      the DCB is still valid in between opens of the database, the primary
**      and secondary locations (physical disk locations) used to store
**      tables for this database, the owner of the database, the database name,
**      and a reference count.
**
**	Notes on DCB status values:
**
**	    DCB_S_JOURNAL:	Database is journaled.  All updates require
**				logical log records to be written which will
**				then be moved to the database journal files
**				by the archiver.
**	    DCB_S_EXCLUSIVE:	Database is opened and locked exclusively by
**				a single session in this server.
**	    DCB_S_ROLLFORWARD:	This DCB was built by the rollforward process.
**	    DCB_S_ONLINE_RCP:	This DCB was built by the recovery process.
**	    DCB_S_RECOVER:	This DCB was built by the RCP or CSP for
**				recovery processing.
**	    DCB_S_FASTCOMMIT:	Database is open with fast commit protocols.
**				All access to this database must go through
**				a common buffer manager.  All updates require
**				logical log records to be written which can
**				be used for REDO recovery.  Requires server to
**				have a fast Commit Thread which flushes dirty
**				pages as part of Consistency Point protocols.
**          DCB_S_DMCM:         Database is open with Distributed Multi-Cache
**                              Management (DMCM) protocol. This is
**                              effectively FastCommit in a Multi-Cache
**                              environment.
**	    DCB_S_INVALID:	DCB is corrupted and cannot be used.  This
**				database will not be served by this server
**				anymore.  The server should be shut down and
**				a new one started.  This error only occurs when
**				the server fails trying to clean up and close
**				a database.
**	    DCB_S_BACKUP:	Database is undergoing online backup. While
**				backup is going on, all updates to the database
**				must be logged with physical log records - this
**				includes system catalog and btree index updates.
**	    DCB_S_SYNC_CLOSE:	Database files are opened sync-at-close.
**				Currently used only by rollforwarddb, this
**				uses Unix fsync() function to bypass O_SYNC 
**				writes and force file via fsync() at close.
**          DCB_S_PRODUCTION    Database is operating in production mode. All
**                              operations that attempt to write to system
**                              catalogs are not allowed
**
**      DCBs are queued to the server control block(SVCB) and are pointed to 
**      by table control blocks(TCBs) and open database control blocks (ODCBs)
**      associated with this database.  A pictorial representation of DCBs in 
**      an active server enviroment is:

**                     +----------------------------------+
**                     
** History:
**      01-sep-85 (jennifer)
**          Created for Jupiter.
**	 9-dec-1988 (rogerk)
**	    Added DCB_S_INVALID status.  This specifies that the database
**	    control block cannot be used.  It is not built correctly and
**	    cannot be cleaned up properly.
**	21-jan-1989 (mikem)
**	    Added DCB_NOSYNC_MASK.
**	24-jan-1989 (Edhsu)
**	    Added dcb_dmp to support online backup.
**	 6-feb-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added dcb_bm_served field.  This describes whether the database
**	    can be served by one (DCB_SINGLE) or many (DCB_MULTIPLE) buffer
**	    managers.
**	 2-may-1989 (anton)
**	    local collation support (add collation field)
**	18-sep-89 (rogerk)
**	    Added dcb_lx_id to keep track of transaction for open database.
**	    This is added to avoid requiring an LGbegin call to close a
**	    database.
**	29-sep-89 (rogerk)
**	    Added DCB_S_BACKUP status which indicates that the database is
**	    undergoing online backup.  This status is used by the server to
**	    determine if special logging is necessary.
**	10-jan-90 (rogerk)
**	    Added DCB_S_OFFLINE_CSP status to show that the CSP has the
**	    database open during startup recovery.  Using this and the
**	    DCB_S_CSP (which is set during node failure) indicates whether
**	    the database is open by the CSP.
**	17-oct-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Great Merge of DMF : Move 6.4 changes into 6.5 line.
**
**	    19-nov-90 (rogerk)
**		Added dcb_timezone field for future handling of timezones.
**		The field is not currently used, but could be used to record
**		the timezone in which the database resides.
**		This was done as part of the DBMS Timezone changes.
**      24-sep-92 (stevet)
**          Changed scb_timezone of DMP_DCB to scb_tzcb, which is a pointer 
**          the timezone structure TM_TZ_CB.
**	18-jan-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Reduced Logging Project: removed old OFFLINE_CSP status.
**      26-apr-1993 (bryanp)
**          6.5 Cluster support:
**              Replace all uses of DM_LOG_ADDR with LG_LA or LG_LSN.
**		Added dcb_backup_lsn so that we can track the Log Sequence
**		    Number of the start of the backup.
**		Remove the DCB_S_CSP status flag for a database, since we no
**		    longer need to know when a database is being processed by
**		    the CSP.
**		Added a dcb_add_count to track number of users who think they
**		    have added this database.
**	24-may-1993 (robf)
**	    Secure 2.0: Add dcb_last_secid field to track last security
**	    id allocated for this database.
**	26-jul-1993 (bryanp)
**	    The dcb_lx_id field is no longer needed, since we no longer log a
**		DM0L_CLOSEDB log record when closing a database.
**	    Replace all uses of DM_LKID with LK_LKID.
**	23-aug-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Renamed DCB_S_RCP to DCB_S_ONLINE_RCP as it is set only when doing
**	    online recovery processing.
**	    Added definition for DCB_S_RECOVER.
**      18-oct-93 (jrb)
**          Added dcb_wrkspill_idx to indicate which location is to be used 
**          next for this db;  this field is typically updated without
**          semaphoring.
**     05-nov-1993 (smc)
**          Bug #58635
**          Made l_reserved & owner elements PTR for consistency with
**	    DM0M_OBJECT.
**	11-apr-96 (stephenb)
**	    Add DCB_S_REPLICATE flag value and rep_* fields to support
**	    DBMS replication.
**     01-aug-1996 (nanpr01 for ICL phil.p)
**          Introduced dcb_status of DCB_S_DMCM to indicate that the database
**          is opened with the Distributed Multi-Cache Management (DMCM)
**          protocol.
**	20-jun-97 (stephenb)
**	    add field dcb_bad_cdds to record non-replicating CDDSs
**	21-aug-1997 (nanpr01)
**	    Store the version info for FIPS upgrade.
**	21-mar-1999 (nanpr01)
**	    Support raw locations.
**	16-aug-1999 (nanpr01)
**	    Implementation of SIR 92299. Enabaling journalling on a
**	    online checkpoint. dcb_eback_lsn keeps the last lsn from
**	    the online checkpoint. 
**      06-Mar-2000 (hanal04) Bug 100742 INGSRV 1122.
**          Added DCB_S_MLOCKED as a new dcb_status value. This is an optional
**          flag used to indicate that the DCB mutex is held. If set it MUST
**          be unset immediately prior to releasing the DCB mutex.
**	16-mar-2001 (stephenb)
**	    Add unicode collation table, dcb_ucollation.
**	05-Mar-2002 (jenjo02)
**	    Added dcb_seq, list of opened Sequence Generators.
**	14-Jan-2004 (schka24)
**	    Add list of open partition master TCB's.
**      07-Jun-2005 (inifa01) b111211 INGSRV2580
**          Verifydb reports error; S_DU1619_NO_VIEW iirelation indicates that
**          there is a view defined for table a (owner ingres), but none exists,
**          when view(s) on a table are dropped.
**          Were making DMT_ALTER call on DMT_C_VIEW, to turn on iirelation.relstat
**          TCB_VBASE bit, indicating view is defined over table(s).  TCB_VBASE
**          not tested anywhere in 2.6 and not turned off when view is dropped.
**          qeu_cview() call to dmt_alter() to set bit has been removed,
**          removing references to TCB_VBASE here.
**	09-Oct-2007 (jonj)
**	    Add DCB_STATUS, DCB_LOC_FLAGS defines.
**       8-Jun-2009 (hanal04) Code Sprint SIR 122168 Ticket 387
**          Added DCB_S_MUST_LOG to flag DBs that this DBMS must log all
**          activity. SET NOLOGGING is blocked.
**	6-Nov-2009 (kschendel) SIR 122757
**	    Add has-raw-location convenience flag to status.
**	12-Nov-2009 (kschendel) SIR 122882
**	    dbcmptlvl is now an integer.
**	15-Jan-2010 (jonj)
**	    SIR 121619 MVCC: Add DCB_S_MVCC, DCB_S_MVCC_DISABLED
**	    DCB_S_MVCC_TRACE, DCB_S_MVCC_JTRACE
**      07-Oct-2010 (horda03) b124559
**          Add DCB_S_RO_INCREMENTAL_RFP to indicate a DB which is opened in
**          READ mode only (WRITE downgraded).
**	17-Nov-2010 (jonj) SIR 124738
**	    Add dcb_mo, pointer to persistent MO for database, if any.
**	24-May-2011 (drivi01) m1871
**	    Add DMP_LOC_ENTRY for root and ckp locations for x100
**	    server.

** Name:  DMP_FCB - DMF internal control block for open file information.
**
** Description:
**      This typedef defines the control block required to keep information
**      about open files associated with database tables. 
**
**      Most of the information in the FCB comes from runtime information
**      provided from call to the compatability library DIopen
**      routine.  This control block varies in size for each operating
**      system.  The DI_FCBSIZE constant is used to determine how large
**      this control block should be.  All FCB's have a fixed size portion
**      which contains the control block header, a pointer to the table
**      control block (TCB)  associated with this control block, a
**      state variable indicating if the file is currently open or closed, 
**      and the file name.
**
**      FCBs are only associated with table control blocks.  
**      A pictorial representation of FCBs in an active transaction enviroment
**      is:

**	18-feb-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Temporary table enhancements:
**	    Added FCB_DEFERRED_IO and FCB_MATERIALIZING flags to fcb_state,

**	    Added fcb_mutex to DMP_FCB.
**	10-sep-1992 (rogerk)
**	    Reduced Logging Project: Added support for partial tables.
**	    Added FCB_NOTINIT flag which indicates that an fcb has not
**	    been initialized with location information and should not
**	    be opened on the next dm2f_open_file call.
**	    Also added fcb_physical_allocation and fcb_logical_allocation

**	    Changed fcb_tcb_ptr to be a pointer to a TableIO control block
**	    rather than a TCB (temporarily left named fcb_tcb_ptr rather

** Name: DMP_HCB - DMF internal control block for TCB hashing.
**
** Description:
**      This typedef defines the control block required to keep information
**	about the TCB's that are currently in memory.
**
**	The HCB is actually just a array of hash buckets to queues of TCB that
**	that hash into these buckets.  The information in each hash queue entry
**	includes the next and previous pointers.  Secondary indexes only hash on
**	the base-id, so they will always hash to (and find) the base table TCB;
**	Partition TCB's hash using both base and index-id's, because otherwise
**	the hash chain would be as long as the number of partitions (which can
**	be well into the 10000's for TPC-H type things).  Partitions share the
**	same base-id as the partitioned master, though, so finding the master
**	is easy enough.
**
**	Hash chains need mutex protection in a multi-threaded environment.  A
**	mutex for every hash chain won't work, though, because of partitioned
**	tables.  The master and its partitions may be on different chains, and
**	at times we may need to mutex both.  To avoid deadlock, what's done
**	instead is to access a mutex based solely on the base-id (even for
**	partitions).  We should only need a few dozen mutexes to suitably
**	parallelize access to unrelated	tables;  the mutex is only needed
**	when finding and creating TCB's.
**
**	I have rather arbitrarily decreed that there will be 7 bits of
**	mutex-hash, and another 7-bits of additional hash chain hash.  Thus,
**	each mutex protects 128 hash chains, and there are 16384 hash buckets
**	altogether.  (Buckets are small, and this only adds up to 150K or so
**	of memory, depending on how big	a mutex is in any given implementation.)
**
**	The hcb_tq mutex protects the entire hash table, and is taken when
**	manipulating the free queue (hcb_ftcb_list).
**	If taking both, a hash entry mutex precedes the hcb-tq mutex.
**	Also one can take both hash and tcb mutexes;  again, take the hash
**	entry mutex first.
**
**	A pictorial representation of the HCB in an active server 
**      environment is:

** Name: DMP_ROWACCESS - Control info needed for compressed row accessing
**
** Description:
**
**	This structure bundles up all the info needed to access a row,
**	possibly with (row) compression.
**
**	The DMP_ROWACCESS structure contains:
**	- Attribute pointer array and number of attributes
**	- the compression type (TCB_C_xxx)
**
**	The rowaccess user has to initialize the above, and then it calls
**	a setup routine to finish the rowaccessor.  Setup calculates the
**	additional structure members:
**
**	- the worst-case row expansion in bytes, to be added to relwid to
**	  get the worst-case row width.  (All compression schemes can make
**	  the row bigger in some cases.)
**	- (De)compression control array, if used, and number of entries.
**	  The control array is compression scheme specific;  e.g. for
**	  standard row compression, it's a set of directives that eliminate
**	  the need to examine the row attribute by attribute.
**	- Compression and decompression call vector.
**	- A flag saying whether the compression method affects LOB
**	  coupons (the ADP_PERIPHERAL object stored in the row).
**
**	There are typically a few of these things floating around, e.g.
**	one for the base row, one for leaf entries, maybe one for index
**	entries, etc.
**
**	FOR FUTURE:  at the moment, the rowaccessor is entirely concerned
**	with attributes and compression.  It might be nice to somehow
**	encapsulate the need for row versioning here too...????

**  RCB - SECTION
**
**       This section defines all structures needed to build
**       and access the information in a Record access Control Block (RCB).
**       The following structs are defined:

/*}
** Name:  DMP_RCB - DMF internal control block for open table information.
**
** Description:
**      This typedef defines the control block required to keep information
**      about accesing records from a table.  This information varies on
**      each open of a table.  
**      
**      Most of the information in the RCB comes from runtime information
**      provided on the open call to DMF.  All opens must be within a 
**      transaction context, therefore the RCB contains a transaction 
**      identifier and is also queued to a Transaction Control Block (XCB).
**      The RCB also contains information relating this RCB to a specific 
**      transaction savepoint and a specific transaction lock list.
**      Other open information includes database and table identifiers to
**      uniquely identify the table being opened, locking parameters which
**      may have been previously specified by a user using setlock commands,
**      the access mode,  and the update mode.  
**
**      The RCB also maintains positioning information needed for succesive
**      record retrieval.  This information is provided at runtime on
**      a position call to DMF and includes the lowest and highest TIDs 
**      needed for this retrieval(this allows partial and exact scans
**      of a table), the current TID which points to the record last 
**      returned with a get call to DMF, the qualifying function and
**      argument list which provides a mechanism for DMF to fully 
**      qualify records returned with a get call to DMF, and two records
**      used for storing the record pointed to by current TID and one for
**      a work area for creating keys, compressing records, etc.  
**      

**      The RCB is primarily used by the record access routines of the
**      physical layer (i.e. routines to get, delete, replace, and
**      put records).  However the low level routines for page management
**      (including page level locking and escalation of locks to table
**      level) and recovery management (including logging of updates,
**      page allocations, btree splits or joins, etc.) need to access and
**      update certain information contained in the RCB.
**
**      A RCB is associated with a transaction through the Transaction
**      Control Block (XCB) queue as well as a table through the Table
**      Control Block (TCB) queue.  Since the size of an RCB is dependent
**      on the table it is associated with (i.e. the  record length 
**      is differs per table), once an RCB is allocated, it is not
**      deallocated until the associated TCB is deallocated.  Instead
**      it is queued off a TCB queue for free RCBs.  This significantly
**      shortens open table time for repeat operations.  
**
**	A summary of the lists that an RCB can be found on:
**	Each TCB has an active-RCB list headed at tcb_rq_next and linked
**	through rcb_q_next and _prev.
**	Each TCB has a free-TCB list headed at tcb_fq_next and linked
**	through rcb_q_next and _prev.  An RCB is either active or free.
**	All RCB's for a given TCB and transaction are linked in a singly-
**	linked ring, linked through rcb_rl_next and generally found
**	via xcb_rq_next.  This ring is only walked or manipulated by
**	the session owning the transaction, it's not to be messed with
**	by other threads.
**	All RCB's for a table that might possibly be updating are connected by
**	a doubly-linked list through rcb_upd_list starting at tcb_upd_rcbs.
**	All RCB's for a partitioned master that might possibly be updating
**	any partition are similarly linked through the master tcb_upd_rcbs
**	and rcb_mupd_list.  These two "possibly updating" lists are merely for
**	gathering reasonably accurate row and page counts that include
**	in-flight queries.  Since partitioned masters are never updated
**	directly (there's nothing there to update!), an RCB cannot be
**	on both lists for the same TCB.
**
**	The TCB mutex must be held to manipulate any of the lists except
**	for the rl_next ring.
**

**      A pictorial representation of RCBs in an active transaction enviroment
**      is:

** History:
**      01-sep-85 (jennifer)
**          Created for Jupiter.
**	30-sep-1988 (rogerk)
**	    Added rcb_hash_nofull field to keep track of the free space
**	    status on a hash overflow chain as the chain is traversed.
**	 7-nov-1988 (rogerk)
**	    Added rcb_compress field.  This gives the compression type
**	    for compressed tables.
**	 2-may-1989 (anton)
**	    added collation field
**	15-aug-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added support for Non-SQL Gateway.  Added rcb_gateway_rsb.  This
**	    is the gateway request block that is returned on a gateway table
**	    open.  It must be passed to the gateway for all record level calls
**	    on that table.
**	 6-dec-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added rcb_bt_bi_logging field to indicate that btree leaf pages
**	    should use Before Image logging.  This is used during online
**	    backup so that leaf updates can be backed out.
**	14-jun-90 (linda, bryanp)
**	    Add RCB_A_OPEN_NOACCESS access code for rcb, indicating open which
**	    does not allow access other than a close.  For gateways support of
**	    remove table command where underlying file does not exist.
**	18-jun-90 (linda, bryanp)
**	    Add RCB_A_MODIFY access code, indicating that we are opening the
**	    table only to get statistical information.  For Gateway tables,
**	    this means that it is okay if the file does not exist; default
**	    statistics will be used in that case.
**	29-apr-1991 (Derek)
**	    Added open duration performance counters.
**	17-oct-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Great Merge of DMF : Move 6.4 changes into 6.5 line.
**
**	    19-nov-1990 (rogerk)
**		Added an ADF_CB to the Record Control Block.  This is now used
**		by DMF instead of allocated adf control blocks on the stack
**		when they are needed.  This makes it easier for DMF to keep
**		track of and set ADF variables associated with each session.
**		This was done as part of the DBMS Timezone changes.
**	    12-feb-1991 (mikem)
**		Added two new fields rcb_val_logkey and rcb_logkey to DMP_RCB
**		structure to support returning logical key values to the client
**		which caused the insert of the tuple and thus caused them to be
**		assigned.
**	    23-jul-91 (markg)
**		Added new RCB_F_USER_ERROR return status for qualification
**		function. Also included some explanatory comments about the 
**		actions performed for each qualification function return 
**		status. (b38679)
**	05-jun-92 (kwatts)
**	    Added comment giving updated values for rcb_compress field.
**	05-nov-92 (jnash)
**	    Temp hack of recovery bitfield to bypass tid locking 
**	    until new recovery code integrated.
**	18-nov-92 (jnash)
**	    Reduced Logging Project (phase 2):
**	      - Took out temporary use of rcb_recovery field.
**	      - Add rcb_usertab_jnl for system catalog rcbs to indicate the
**		journal status of the usertable being accessed.
**	15-mar-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Reduced Logging - Phase IV:
**	    Removed obsolete rcb_bt_bi_logging and rcb_merge_logging fields.
**      26-apr-1993 (bryanp)
**          6.5 Cluster support:
**              Replace all uses of DM_LOG_ADDR with LG_LA or LG_LSN.
**		Add rcb_state flag RCB_IN_MINI_TRAN to allow tracking when a
**		    particular RCB is in the process of performing a mini-
**		    transaction. Technically, I suppose, the RCB is not the
**		    correct place for this flag, since it's really more of an
**		    XCB state than an RCB state, but the rcb_state field is
**		    convenient since the RCB happens to be the control block
**		    that is available to the buffer manager, which wishes to
**		    know this information (for enforcing cluster recovery
**		    protocols).
**     05-nov-1993 (smc)
**          Bug #58635
**          Made l_reserved & owner elements PTR for consistency with DM_SVCB.
**	8-may-96 (stephenb)
**	    Add rep_* fileds to support replication.
**	06-sep-1996 (canor01)
**	    Add rcp_tupbuf for compression.  Allocate buffer once.
**     01-aug-1996 (nanpr01 for ICL phil.p)
**          Added new rcb_states of RCB_RECOVER and RCB_FLUSHED for support 
**          of DMCM protocol. Both states used when causing all caches to
**          flush dirty pages for a table prior to smart disk scan / modify.
**	21-aug-96 (stephenb)
**	    Add RCB pointer fpr replicator cdds lookup table (rep_cdds_rcb)
**      22-nov-96 (stial01,dilma04)
**          Row Locking Project:
**          Add RCB_K_ROW value to indicate row level locking granularity;
**          For reposition to CURRENT cursor position in BTREE added:
**              rcb_low_lsn, rcb_low_clean_count, rcb_low_key_ptr, rcb_low_tidp
**          For reposition to FETCHED row in BTREE added:
**              rcb_fet_lsn, rcb_fet_clean_count, rcb_fet_key_ptr, rcb_fet_tidp
**          For reposition to STARTING position in BTREE added:
**              rcb_pos_bt_lsn, rcb_pos_bt_clean_count
**              rcb_p_flag, rcb_p_lk_type, rcb_p_hk_type
**          Add the following for rcb_update for replace as delete/put:
**              rcb_bt_put_lsn, rcb_bt_put_cc, rcb_bt_del_lsn, rcb_bt_del_cc

** Name: DMP_TABLE_IO - Table IO Control Block
**
** Description:
**	This structure contains information needed to perform IO operations
**	on a table.  It is normally contained within a TCB and groups together
**	those table control block fields which are needed for IO actions.
**
**	The control block is used by low-level portions of the system (mainly
**	the buffer manager) which need to perform IO actions but which do
**	not wish to know about logical attributes of the table contained in
**	the TCB.
**
** History:
**      10-sep-1992 (rogerk)
**          6.5 Recovery Project: Created to collect together the TCB fields
**	    needed by the buffer manager so that a smaller structure than
**	    a TCB could be passed to fix/unfix page routines.
**	20-jun-1994 (jnash)
**	    Add tbio_sync_close, used to request async writes and that
**	    sync be performed during dm2t_close.
**	06-mar-1996 (stial01 for bryanp)
**	    Add tbio_page_size to the DMP_TABLE_IO structure.
**      01-aug-1996 (nanpr01 for ICL phil.p)
**          Introduced extra tbio_cache_flag TBIO_CACHE_DMCM to indicate
**          that Distributed Multi-Cache Management (DMCM) protocol is
**          in use and that other buffer manager protocols will be
**          sidestepped.
**	24-Feb-1997 (jenjo02 for somsa01)
**	    Cross-integrated 428939 from main.
**	    Added tbio_extended, which is set if the table is an extended
**	    table.
**	07-May-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Added tbio_cache_ix to TBIO.
**	09-Oct-2007 (jonj)
**	    Add TBIO_STATUS, TBIO_CACHE_FLAGS defines.
**	1-Sep-2008 (kibro01) b120843
**	    Add status for being in recovery so we can ignore a flush of a
**	    page which was beyond the end of the physical file due to UNDO.

/*}
** Name:  DMP_TCB - DMF internal control block for database table information.
**
** Description:
**      This typedef defines the control block required to keep information
**      about a table that is not associated with an open of the table, but
**      remains the same regardless of the number of times it is opened by 
**      one or more sessions (server-threads).  
**      
**      Most of the information in the TCB comes from the three main system
**      tables: RELATION table, ATTRIBUTE table, and INDEX table.  For each
**      table in a database there is a record in the RELATION table describing
**      the structure of the table and the file.  This record is included
**      in a TCB.  For each attribute of a table there is a record in the 
**      the ATTRIBUTE table describing the characteristics of that attribute.
**      Information from each of these records is included in the variable
**      portion of the TCB.  This information is also used to build the
**      primary key information required  for keyed searches.
**      For each secondary index of a table there is a record in the INDEX 
**      table describing which attributes of the base table are used to 
**      create the index key.  A TCB used to describe an index table will 
**      contain information from the index table, TCB's used to describe base 
**      tables does not contain this information.
**      If a table resides on multiple locations, then the IIDEVICE table
**      contains information describing each additional locations for
**      this table.  If a table resides at only one locations this 
**      inforamtion is contained in the relation record.  Only additional
**      locations are recorded in the IIDEVICE table.
**
**      Other information contained in the TCB includes such things as the 
**      counts of the number of tuples or pages added while it is cached 
**      (note these are accumulative for all threads of a server and are 
**      only updated periodically), the current state of TCB,
**      a queue of associated index TCB's, and many pointers to associated
**      DMF internal control blocks, such as Record Access Control Block
**      (RCB) used for each open of a table, the File Control Block (FCB)
**      used to open the physical file associated with a table, and the
**      Database Control Block(DCB) used to identify which database this
**      TCB belongs to.
**
**      When a TCB is allocated for a table, all associated control blocks
**      are allocated and initialized at the same time.  This means that all
**      TCB's for all index tables associated with a base table are cached
**      with the base TCB.  Index table TCB's are not queued directly to
**      hash buckets, but are known only through the base TCB.  Partitions of
**	a partitioned table are handled differently;  while the entire PP array
**	is initialized with the master TCB, partition TCB's are only opened as
**	needed.  Partition TCB's are hashed independently of the master TCB.
**
**      The Table Control Block (TCB) is cached by the DMF.  To be able to 
**      rapidly determine if a TCB exists for a specified table, a hashing 
**      scheme exists to minimize the amount of time needed to locate this TCB.
**      Each table has a unique identifier, nameley (database_id,table_id).  
**      The table-id for all tables is in two parts:
**
**          table_id.base   (unique identifier for base table)
**          table_id.index  (zero for base tables, +unique identifier
**                           for index tables, id | sign-bit for partitions).

**
**      Since index tables are always associated with their base tables
**      (e.g. all table locks are obtained on the base table, not the index
**      table even if the index table is opened directly), The TCB caching 
**      scheme uses the base ID and partition ID, but not any index ID.
**      Each server has a TCB hash array pointed to be the Server Control
**      Block (SVCB).  The number of buckets in the hash array is also stored
**      in the SVCB.  The TCB identifier is hashed (divided by number of
**      buckets) to determine which bucket it would be queued to if it existed.
**      The bucket queue is searched matching on (database_id,table_id).
**      If it is found, it is checked to determine if the information is
**      still accurate, this is done by checking a value lock (valid stamp)
**      obtained when the TCB was built.  If it is still good, it can be
**      used, otherwise it must be thrown away since a major change to the 
**      table occurred, such as deleted, modified, etc. while this server 
**      had the TCB chached but was not using it.  
**
**	Partitioned tables introduce their own set of complications.
**	The partitioned table itself is called the master, or Partitioned
**	table.  The actual partitions carrying the data are the partition
**	tables.  The master table must always be opened if a partition is
**	open, as only the master carries iiattribute rows.  The master
**	TCB includes a physical-partition array, often abbreviated to
**	the PP array.  This array is indexed by physical partition number
**	and maps partitions to their partition table tabids.  Each
**	partition TCB points back to the master.  A master or non-partitioned
**	table points to itself.  As mentioned above, partitions share the
**	master table base ID, but use an "index" ID with the sign-bit set
**	as well.  Sharing the master base ID a) makes it trivial for a
**	partition to associate itself to its master, and b) makes it easy
**	to escalate from partition page-or-row locking to master table-level
**	locks.
**
**      Many TCB fields are protected against multi-thread updates by
**      the TCB's hash mutex, rather than by a TCB specific mutex.
**      (Part of the reason for this is that many relevant status bits are
**      only in the master/base TCB, and the hash mutex protects all partition
**      and index TCB's simultaneously.)  Some fields specifically not
**      alterable without holding the hash mutex are:
**          tcb_status
**          tcb_ref_count
**          tcb_q_next and _prev if the TCB is on a hash chain
**      Note that this is not an exhaustive list.
**
**      A pictorial representation of this scheme is:

** History:
**      01-sep-85 (jennifer)
**          Created for Jupiter.
**      16-nov-87 (jennifer)
**          Added mulitple locations per table support.
**      19-Oct-88 (teg)
**	    chgd relstat constants to hex and put documented their meaning,
**	    added TCB_VIEW.
**	10-Feb-89 (rogerk)
**	    Added tcb_status field in order to mark TCB busy while being
**	    built or released.  This way we can avoid requiring a lock
**	    in order to release a tcb.
**	06-mar-89 (neil)
**          Rules: Added TCB_RULE.
**	10-apr-89 (mikem)
**	    Logical Key project.  
**		Added tcb_{high,low}_logical_key fields to keep track of an 8 
**		byte unique id.  Also added a new relstat status bit 
**	        TCB_SYS_MAINTAINED.
**      20-jun-89 (jennifer)
**          Security development.  Added TCB_SECURE to relstat bit.
**	15-aug-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added support for Non-SQL Gateway.
**	    Added tcb_logging, tcb_logical_log, tcb_update_idx, tcb_nofile,
**	    tcb_no_tids bitfields.  These are setup when the tcb is built and
**	    describe attributes of the table to many of the dmf routines.  In
**	    this way, attributes - such as whether a table should be logged, or
**	    whether TIDS are supported - are decided at a single point, rather
**	    than at many places in the code.
**	    Added tcb_table_type which is used to decide which record level
**	    routines to call for the table.  For normal Ingres tables, the
**	    table type is set to the storage structure - thus the appropriate
**	    record level routine for that structure is used.  For special
**	    tables, such as gateway tables, this table type is set to something
**	    different.  Can't just use the storage structure since some special
**	    tables also have storage structure types.
**	23-jan-1990 (fred)
**	    Added large object support.  Added a bunch more bit fields to
**	    indicate various parameters to other parts of the code.  This should
**	    help by figuring out these things once.
**	31-jan-90 (teg)
**	    added TCB_COMMENT and TCB_SYNONYM relstat bits for the comment text
**	    and synonym projects.
**	02-mar-90 (andre)
**	    defined TCB_VGRANT_OK for the FIPS project.
**	18-jun-1990 (linda, bryanp)
**	    Added TCB_GW_NOUPDT flag value for relstat field, to enforce the
**	    default non-updateability of gateway tables.
**	24-sep-1990 (rogerk)
**	    Merged 6.3 changes into 6.5.  Moved over DMT_GW_NOUPDT relstat
**	    value from 6.3 code.  Had to change value for DMT_SECURE relstat
**	    value because it clashed with GW_NOUPDT.
**	29-apr-1991 (Derek)
**	    Added new DMP_RELATION fields for allocation project.
**	17-oct-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Great Merge of DMF : Move 6.4 changes into 6.5 line.
**
**	     4-feb-1991 (rogerk)
**		Added support for fixed cache priorities.
**		Added tcb_bmpriority to show table's cache priority.
**	    25-mar-1991 (bryanp)
**		New field tcb_data_atts to point to a list of pointers to data
**		attributes in the table. Either tcb_data_atts or tcb_key_atts
**		should be used when performing data or key compression.
**		New relstat bit, TCB_INDEX_COMP, to indicate that a table uses
**		index compression. 
**		New field tcb_comp_katts_count to store the adjustment count of
**		worst case overhead added by index compression to index entry
**		of the table.
**	15-nov-1991 (fred)
**	    Added relstat2 field to tcb_rel.  This is a temporary fix until the
**	    real project to add it is done.  Peripheral datatype/extension table
**	    support is indicated (currently only) in this field.  Bit mask names
**	    changed to make sure we don't have screw ups...  They are now called
**	    TCB2_HAS_EXTENSIONS and TCB2_EXTENSION to indicate whether a table
**	    has extension tables or is one, respectively.
**	18-feb-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Temporary table enhancements: Added TCB_PEND_DESTROY flag .
**	05-may-1992 (ananth)
**	    Increasing IIrelation tuple size project. 
**	    Increased size of relfree field in DMP_RELATION to 64 bytes.
**	05-jun-92 (kwatts)
**	    Added the MPF fields in DMP_RELATION, relcomptype and 
**	    relpgtype. Added tcb_acc_plv and tcb_acc_tlv to TCB structure.
**	28-jul-92 (rickh)
**	    Carved relstat2 out of 4 relfree bytes.  This is where FIPS
**	    CONSTRAINTS keeps its tasty bits.
**	10-sep-92 (rogerk)
**	    Added support for partial TCB's.  Added TCB_PARTIAL tcb status
**	    to indicate that a TCB may not have all its underlying files
**	    open and may not contain sufficient logical information to
**	    allow logical table access.
**	    Added tcb_table_io control block which contains information
**	    necessary for IO operations.  Moved existing tcb_loc_count,
**	    tcb_location_array, tcb_lalloc, tcb_lpageno, tcb_bmpriority,
**	    tcb_checkeof and tcb_valid_stamp into the table_io control block.
**	    Added new tcb_valid_count field to keep count of the number of
**	    tcb fixes which verified the correctness of the tcb at fix time.
**	    Added new tcb_status wait types which indicate the type of wait
**	    operation being performed when clients wait for other than TCB_BUSY
**	    status.
**	26-oct-1992 (rogerk)
**	    Reduced Logging Project: Added new page type for system catalogs,
**	    TCB_PG_SYSCAT.  Added status for tcb's that have encountered
**	    close errors, TCB_CLOSE_ERROR.
**	9-nov-92 (ed)
**	    removed 24 bytes from relfree for DB_MAXNAME name increases
**	18-jan-1993 (bryanp)
**	    Added TCB_TMPMOD_WAIT to fix temporary table modify bug.
**	16-feb-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Added tcb_open_count to count the number of open RCB's on the table.
**	15-may-1993 (rmuth)
**	    Add relstat2 bits for the following:
**		- to indicate that a table is READONLY
**		- If table is an index to indicate that it is being built 
**		  in "CONCURRENT_ACCESS" mode.
**	    of table.
**	26-jul-1993 (bryanp)
**	    Replace all uses of DM_LKID with LK_LKID.
**	18-oct-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Removed PEND_DESTROY tcb state.
**     05-nov-1993 (smc)
**          Bug #58635
**          Made l_reserved & owner elements PTR for consistency with
**	    DM0M_OBJECT.
**	8-dec-93 (robf)
**          Added TCB_ALARM for security alarms on tables.
**     20-jun-1994 (jnash)
**          Eliminate obsolete tcb_logical_log, bumped free bit count.
**      14-sep-1994 (andyw)
**          Partial Backup/Recovery Project:
**              Added New bitflags to relstat2:
**                  TCB2_PHYS_INCONSISTENT
**                  TCB2_LOGICAL_INCONSISTENT
**                  TCB2_TBL_RECOVERY_DISALLOWED
**      7-dec-1994 (andyw)
**          Added comment for changes made by Steve Wonderly and
**          Roger Sheets
**              added TCB_C_HICOMPRESS  to the DMP_RELATION structure
**              to handle new compression algorithms.
**	06-mar-1996 (stial01 for bryanp)
**	    Add relpgsize to iirelation; reduce relfree accordingly.
**	    Added DMP_NUM_IIRELATION_ATTS to dimension the dm2umod.c array.
**	17-may-96 (stephenb)
**	    Add tcb_replicate and tcb_rep_info fields to support DBMS 
**	    replication.
**      22-jul-1996 (ramra01 for bryanp)
**          Add relversion, reltotwid to iirelation; reduce relfree 
**	    accordingly.
**          Define TCB2_ALTERED to track when a table is altered.
**	23-aug-96 (nick)
**	    Added TCB_INCONS_IDX - base table has inconsistent secondaries.
**     01-aug-1996 (nanpr01 for ICL phil.p)
**          Introduced new tcb_statuses of TCB_FLUSH and TCB_VALIDATED to
**          support TCB callbacks under the DMCM protocol.
**	21-Mar-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Table priority project:
**	    Added reltcpri (Table Cache priority), reduced relfree,
**	    bumped DMP_NUM_IIRELATION_ATTS.
**      21-Apr-1998 (stial01)
**          Added tcb_extended for B90677
**	23-oct-1998 (somsa01)
**	    Added TCB_SESSION_TEMP as an option for relstat.
**	 3-mar-1999 (hayke02)
**	    Move TCB_SESSION_TEMP from relstat to relstat2 to avoid overflow
**	    of i4 (signed 4 byte int).
**	16-aug-1999 (nanpr01)
**	    Implementation of SIR 92299. Enabaling journalling on a
**	    online checkpoint. tcb_iirel_lsn keeps the lsn from the
**	    the iirelation page when TCB was built. 
**      17-Apr-2001 (horda03) Bug 104402
**          Added TCB_NOT_UNIQUE
**	04-May-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Added tcb_relid_len, tcb_relowner_len so that logging and recovery
**	    don't have to constantly strip trailing blanks to compute
** 	    these lengths.
**	08-Nov-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Added DML_XCCB *tcb_temp_xccb, pointer to pending destroy 
**	    XCCB if XCB_SESSION_TEMP temporary table.
**	18-Dec-2003 (schka24)
**	    New iirelation columns and flags for partitioning.
**	12-Jan-2004 (schka24)
**	    More partitioning stuff for tracking reltups/relpages for
**	    partitioned tables.  Trim obsolete/wrong part of tcb picture.
**	22-Jan-2004 (jenjo02)
**	    For Parallel/Partitioning project, added tcb_stmt_unique flag,
**	    tcb_unique_count, tcb_rtb_next, tcb_partno.
**	5-Mar-2004 (schka24)
**	    Remove unused field I added earlier.
**	    Define tcb free-list as a real queue, not a fake one;  easier
**	    to read, and removes a dependency on tcb_q_next being first.
**	30-Jun-2004 (schka24)
**	    Unused relsecid -> relfree1.
**	15-Mar-2005 (schka24)
**	    Introduce show-only TCB status.
**	14-Apr-2006 (jenjo02)
**	    Added relstat TCB_CLUSTERED bit for Clustered Btrees.
**	30-May-2006 (jenjo02)
**	    tcb_ikey_map changed to DB_MAXIXATTS for indexes on
**	    clustered tables.
**	    Removed goofy DMP_NUM_IIRELATION_ATTS define. dm2u_modify
**	    allocates needed memory based on relatts rather than
**	    using the stack.
**	23-Jun-2006 (kschendel)
**	    Relnparts should have been unsigned to allow >32K partitions.
**	23-nov-2006 (dougi)
**	    Re-established TCB_VIEW as 0x40 in relstat. Flag was being
**	    used in iitables view, which may well have been used in
**	    user applications.
**      29-jan-2007 (huazh01)
**          Add TCB_REPTAB bit to indicate this is a replicator
**          specific DMP_TCB. 
**          This fixes bug 117355.
**	09-Oct-2007 (jonj)
**	    Add RELSTAT, RELSTAT2 defines.
**      01-may-2008 (horda03) bug 120349
**          Add TCB_STORAGE define.
**	14-Aug-2008 (kschendel) b120791
**	    Comment update only re mutexing
**	5-jan-2009 (dougi)
**	    Add TCB_X100 (earlier), TCB_X100CL and TCB_X100IX as the various
**	    X100 storage types.
**	23-Oct-2009 (kschendel) SIR 122739
**	    Integrate rowaccessor changes.
**	12-Nov-2009 (kschendel) SIR 122882
**	    Change relcmptlvl from i4 to u_i4, don't want signed compares.
**	    Note TCB_BINARY unused, may become TCB_CLUSTER.
**	17-nov-2009 (dougi)
**	    Add TCB2_X100_INVIEW flag to relstat2 to indicate views with X100
**	    tables.
**	11-may-2010 (stephenb)
**	    Lots of shuffling around for better efficiency and correct
**	    bus alignment without padding. reltups and relpages become
**	    i8; relstat2 is moved next to relstat to provide correct
**	    8-byte alignment for reltups; new larger text fields
**	    (relid, relowner, relloc) are moved to the end of the table
**	    to make sure text compression doesn't affect alignment
