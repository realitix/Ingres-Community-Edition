/*}
** Name: DMPE_COUPON - DMF's idea of the coupon structure
**
** Description:
**
**	LOB data is stored externally to a row, with a "coupon" in the row
**	providing a pointer to the stored LOB data.  The term "coupon" is
**	used a bit loosely, unfortunately.  The on-disk structure stored
**	in the base row is an ADP_PERIPHERAL structure,  which is
**	defined in common in adp.h.  The ADP_PERIPHERAL structure has an
**	ADP_COUPON sub-structure which is the DMF part of the coupon.
**	This ADP_COUPON is defined as 5 i4's in adp.h, but it actually has
**	more structure to it that only DMF knows about.  That additional
**	structure is what is defined here, as a DMPE_COUPON.  Thus the word
**	"coupon" might apply to the entire on-disk ADP_PERIPHERAL, or
**	to the DMF part only.  The latter is more properly called the DMF
**	or DMPE coupon.
**
**	The DMPE_COUPON contains enough information for DMF to reconstruct the
**	data as needed.  The coupon contains some long term information which
**	appears on and is valid on disk, and some short term information, which
**	is zero on disk but possibly nonzero while the coupon is being
**	passed around the server as part of a base row.  The long term part
**	is what's needed to read or write the LOB data, the short term part
**	helps provide extra context so that the LOB data access and the
**	base row access can operate in a compatible way.  (e.g. use the same
**	lock modes.)
**
**	The long term parts of the DMF coupon are:
**	- A logical key value that uniquely identifies the base table row.
**	  The same logical key appears on all etab rows containing the LOB
**	  value.  Although one could have a unique logical key for each LOB
**	  in a base row (if there are more than one), it's not necessary since
**	  the DMF coupon also contains an etab table ID which uniqueifies
**	  things.  The most efficient way is to use one logical key for all
**	  the LOBs in one base table row.
**
**	- The etab table ID of the etab which contains the first segment of
**	  the LOB.  Each LOB points to the next segment, so if the LOB
**	  crosses etabs, it can be figured out as the LOB is read.
**
**	The short term parts of the DMF coupon are:
**	- The base table ID (base ID only, LOB's are not stored specific
**	  to partitions or indexes).
**	- The attribute ID for the LOB column (1-origin).
**	- Flags:
**	  - check the SRID (used by geometry columns to verify the
**	    embedded SRID against the att definition SRID)
**	  - Data-in-final-etab, also known as put-optimization.  This flag
**	    is set when a couponify has enough context available to
**	    send the incoming LOB data directly to the proper etab instead
**	    of to a holding temp.
**	  - Data-in-holding-temp, set when LOB data is in a short term
**	    holding temp table.
**
**	The baseid/attrid parts are at present only used for outgoing
**	LOBs.  Incoming LOB's only use the flags.
**
**	On some platforms, the DMF coupon is sized in adp.h as being 6 i4's
**	instead of 5 i4's.  This is a historical accident due to the
**	DMF coupon once upon a time containing a pointer.  The DMF coupon
**	size cannot change without breaking existing data, so we'll make sure
**	that the DMPE_COUPON matches the ADP_COUPON in size.  The DMF coupon
**	may not take more than 5 i4's to be platform independent, though.
**
** History:
**      17-Jan-1990 (fred)
**          Created.
**	6-May-2004 (schka24)
**	    RCB's belong to threads, and passing RCB's around fails in the
**	    face of parallel query.  Use TCB instead.  Attempt to doc.
**	12-Apr-2010 (kschendel) SIR 123485
**	    Redo the short-term part (again), this time to pass base ID, attr
**	    ID, and flags.  The new blob query CB (BQCB) will supply the
**	    necessary query lifetime context.  More redoing of the doc.
**	27-Apr-2010 (kschendel)
**	    Fix above to conditionalize the coupon fill.  Some compilers
**	    don't understand zero-size arrays.
**	31-Jan-2011 (drivi01)
**	    Take out a64_win from ADP_PERIPHERAL and ADP_COUPON
**	    structures to prevent different size structure
**	    on 32-bit and 64-bit windows, to make it possible
**	    to upgrade from 32-bit build of Ingres to 64-bit.

/* *** Important definition note: ***
** Nothing in DMPE_COUPON may be larger than an i4.
** The DMPE_COUPON may not be larger than i4[5].

** contains a larger object, compiler added padding might screw things up,
** at the least causing incompatibility with existing on-disk coupons.
** If you need an object larger than an i4 (which isn't going to happen
** unless it's redefined entirely), define it as a char or i2/i4 array.

/*
** Name: DMPE_BQCB - Blob Query Context Block
**
** Description:
**
**	LOB processing is a bit unusual in that the storing and retrieval
**	of the LOB data (couponifying and redeeming) is divorced in time
**	from the base row access.  For instance, a base row might be
**	read in a child thread, passed to a parent thread, and as the
**	row heads "out the door" to the client, the LOB coupon is redeemed.
**	At this point, the RCB used for the original base row fetch might
**	have even been closed.  In the inbound direction, similar
**	problems exist:  LOB data has to be stored as it appears, which
**	is before the base row is stored -- which in turn means before
**	bulk-load vs row-put decisions are made, etc.
**
**	The Blob Query Context block (BQCB) connects LOB data processing
**	with base row processing by existing for the life of the query.
**	(When locators have been established, the BQCB can exist until
**	all locators are freed.)  Queries can exist across transactions,
**	such as when commits/aborts are issued inside DBP's;  but in that
**	situation, QEF will re-open everything and it's OK to wipe all
**	BQCB's at transaction end and re-establish new ones.  (Things such
**	as bulk-load cannot persist across transactions in this sense.)
**
**	In the get (outgoing) direction, the BQCB is used to a) allow etabs
**	to be opened using the same lockmode (page, table, mvcc) as the
**	base table was;  and b) allow verification of the embedded SRID
**	for geospatial data.
**
**	In the put (incoming) direction, the BQCB is used to a) centralize
**	logical-key generation for the coupons, and decouple it from the
**	base row handling;  b) centralize the bulk-load decision for etab
**	loading (which can be done independently of bulk-load on the base
**	table);  and c) allow etabs to be opened using the proper lockmode,
**	just as for get.
**
**	The BQCB can also serve as a central point for linking to cached
**	data used for accessing etabs, such as PCB's, DMT/DMR CB's, etc.
**	This will be implemented later.
**
**	One BQCB exists per table per session.  It is created when a
**	table containing LOB's is opened for read or write access (but
**	not for show, noaccess, or modify).  It is normally deleted when
**	the query ends, although as noted above it might continue to
**	exist for the lifetime of any locators.  (In which case the end-
**	of-query call resets some of the BQCB but does not delete it.)
**	All BQCB's for a session are on a linked list headed in the main
**	session thread's DML_SCB.  BQCB's never appear on child thread SCB's.
**
**	Given a base table ID, the relevant BQCB can be found by scanning
**	the BQCB list.  (Normally, only a few LOB-containing tables are
**	open per query, so no hashing should be needed.)  Any RCB opened
**	for read/write access to a LOB table will contain the BQCB pointer
**	in the RCB for direct access.
**
**	The BQCB contains:
**	- the base table ID (just the db_tab_base, don't need the index)
**	- Link to next BQCB on the SCB chain
**	- Pointer to RCB opened for logical-key generation
**	- Load-etabs indicator (yes, no, unknown)
**	- Single-row vs multi-row operation flag, default is single row
**	- etab locking hint: use table locking
**	- etab locking hint: use MVCC locking, and CRIB pointer if MVCC
**	- Number of LOB attributes
**	- Array with one entry per LOB column:
**		- attribute number (1 origin)
**		- Current SRID from att definition if geometry type
**		- (Future) real-etab get and put pop-cb+pcb lists
**
** Edit History:
**	12-Apr-2010 (kschendel) SIR 123485
