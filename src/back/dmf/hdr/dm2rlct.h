** Name: DM2R_L_CONTEXT - Structure for loading sort tables.
**
** Description:
**      This typedef defines the structure used for the context
**      required when loading a table with sorted records.
**      This structure points to the control block needed by
**      the build routines, and the sort control block used
**      by the sorter.  It also contains enough room for 
**      a record which is fetched from the sorter and put
**      to the table after all records have been given to the
**      sorter.
**
** History:
**    04-sep-1986 (jennifer)
**          Created for Jupiter.
**	30-jan-1992 (bonobo)
**	    Removed the redundant typedef to quiesce the ANSI C 
**	    compiler warnings.
**	22-oct-92 (rickh)
**	    Replaced all references to DM_CMP_LIST with DB_CMP_LIST.
**     05-nov-1993 (smc)
**          Bug #58635
**          Made l_reserved & owner elements PTR for consistency with DM_SVCB.
**	    In this instance the names of the reserved elements were altered
**          to be consistent with their type.
**      08-Oct-2002 (hanch04)
**          Replace the i4 for length with a SIZE_TYPE (size_t) to allow
**          64-bit memory allocation.
**	11-Aug-2004 (schka24)
**	    Build data cleanup: remove some unused stuff.
**	15-Aug-2005 (jenjo02)
**	    Implement multiple DMF LongTerm memory pools and
**	    ShortTerm session memory.
**	    Define LCT_CB as DM_LCT_CB.
