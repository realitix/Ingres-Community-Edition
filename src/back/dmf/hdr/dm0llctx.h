/**
** Name: DM0LLCTX.H - Logging system control blocks.
**
** Description:
**      This structure describes the control blocks used by the logging
**	system.
**
**	A DMP_LCTX structure is created by calling dm0l_allocate. In a single
**	node logging system (that is, everywhere except the VAXCluster), each
**	process needs a DMP_LCTX to access the local logging system. In a
**	multi-node logging system, most processes still only access the local
**	logging system and hence still only have a single DMP_LCTX instance.
**	The CSP process, however, manages simultaneous recovery of multiple
**	nodes, and hence manages multiple LCTX structures.
**
** History:
**      24-jul-1986 (Derek)
**          Created for Jupiter.
**	26-apr-1993 (bryanp)
**	    6.5 Cluster Support:
**	    Enhancements for multi-node cluster support. Information about the
**	    current state of the log file, such as BOF, EOF, and last CP, which
**	    we formerly kept in other recovery structures, we now keep here.
**	    This helps support operations such as multi-node restart recovery,
**	    which need to simultaneously access log files from multiple nodes.
**	23-aug-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Added lctx_bkcnt field to allow users to reference the log file
**	    size.  This facilitates log address arithmetic.

** Name: DM0LLCTX - The logging system read context.
**
** Description:
**      This structure decribes the control block used by the logging routines
**	to position and read from the log file.
**
** History:
**      24-jul-1986 (Derek)
**          Created for Jupiter.
**	30-jan-1992 (bonobo)
**	    Removed the redundant typedef to quiesce the ANSI C 
**	    compiler warnings.
**	26-apr-1993 (bryanp)
**	    Enhancements for multi-node cluster support. Information about the
**	    current state of the log file, such as BOF, EOF, and last CP, which
**	    we formerly kept in other recovery structures, we now keep here.
**	    This helps support operations such as multi-node restart recovery,
**	    which need to simultaneously access log files from multiple nodes.
**	    Added a node_id field to the lctx to hold the logfile's node ID.
**	23-aug-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Added lctx_bkcnt field to allow users to reference the log file
**	    size.  This facilitates log address arithmetic.
**	05-nov-1993 (smc)
**          Bug #58635
**          Made l_reserved & owner elements PTR for consistency with DM_SVCB.
**	30-nov-93 (swm)
**          Bug #58635
**	    Changed type of lctx_1_reserved and lctx_2_reserved from i4 to
**	    i4 * to match corresponding standard DMF header elements.
**      08-Oct-2002 (hanch04)
**          Replace the i4 for length with a SIZE_TYPE (size_t) to allow
**          64-bit memory allocation.
**	30-Mar-2005 (jenjo02)
**	    Added LCTX_WAS_RECOVERED lctx_status flag, set
**	    during cluster recovery if recovery on that
**	    log was really needed.
**	03-may-2005 (hayke02)
**	    Add pool_type to match obj_pool_type in DM_OBJECT.
**	25-Jul-2005 (sheco02)
**	    Fixed the typo caused by the previous x-integration 478041.
**      05-Aug-2005 (hanje04)
**          Back out change 478041 as it should never have been X-integrated
**          into main in the first place.
**	15-Aug-2005 (jenjo02)
**	    Implement multiple DMF LongTerm memory pools and
**	    ShortTerm session memory.
**	    Define LCTX_CB as DM_LCTX_CCB.
