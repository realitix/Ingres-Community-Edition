/**
**
**  Name: LGEVENT.C - Implements the LGevent function of the logging system
**
**  Description:
**	This module contains the code which implements LGevent.
**	
**	    LGevent -- Await an event in the logging system
**	    LG_signal_event -- signal the occurrence of an event
**	    LG_suspend	    -- record that this transaction is suspending
**	    LG_resume	    -- resume a suspended transaction
**	    LG_suspend_lbb  -- attach an LXB to a log buffer's wait queue
**	    LG_resume_lbb   -- resume LXBs on a log buffer's wait queue
**
**  History:
**	Summer, 1992 (bryanp)
**	    Working on the new portable logging and locking system.
**	26-oct-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Add includes of dmf.h and ulf.h.
**	29-oct-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Improve error message logging.
**	15-mar-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Reduced Logging - Phase IV:
**	    Removed EBACKUP, FBACKUP, 1PURGE_ACTIVE, 2PURGE_COMPLETE states.
**	17-mar-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Moved lgd status values to lgdstat.h so that they are visible
**	    by callers of LGshow(LG_S_LGSTS).
**	14-jul-93 (ed)
**	    replacing <dbms.h> by <gl.h> <sl.h> <iicommon.h> <dbdbms.h>
**	31-jan-1994 (jnash)
**	    Fix lint detected sys_err un-initialization.
**	05-Jan-1995 (jenjo02)
**	    Defined new mask for LGevent suspends, CS_LGEVENT_MASK.
**	    Mutex granularity project. Semaphores now must be explicitly
**	    named in calls to LKMUTEX.C
**	18-Jan-1996 (jenjo02)
**          lbk_table replaced with lfbb_table (LFBs) and ldbb_table
**          (LDBs) to ensure that semaphores now embedded in those
**          structures are not corrupted. Similarly, sbk_table 
**          replaced with lpbb_table (LPBs), lxbb_table (LXBs), and
**          lpdb_table (LPDs).
**	25-Jan-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Mutex granularity project. Many semaphores replace
**	    the lone lgd_mutex.
**	    Added lgd_mutex_is_locked boolean to LG_signal_event()
**	    prototype.
**	21-Feb-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    LG_resume: Resume LXB only if it's actually waiting. Testing 
**	    kept running into the situation whereby an LXB was queued
**	    on an lbb_wait queue, wanting notification when the
**	    buffer hit the disk. In the mean time, the thread
**	    continued processing, but when RCP finished the i/o,
**	    it resumed the already running thread. In this instance,
**	    DI was trying to open a file, calling CScause_event()
**	    to induce a slave to actually do the open, and CSsuspend()-ing
**	    until the slave completed its open work. In the meantime,
**	    LGresume was being called from RCP on write completion,
**	    CSresume()-ing the DI path and causing CSsuspend() to
**	    think the event (the slave's open) had already completed,
**	    manifesting itself in an "file open error".
**	19-Apr-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    In LG_suspend() put new waiters on the end of the queue
**	    instead of the front.
**	16-Jul-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Changed LG_signal_event() to accept a second parm of lgd_status
**	    bits to be turned off at the same time the 1st parm bits are
**	    being turned on.
**	06-Nov-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Changed LG_E_xxxxxxxx event values to match lgd_status
**	    values to lessen the time we must hold lgd_status_mutex.
**	07-Nov-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Rewrote the way that LXBs waiting on LG events are awoken.
**	    Previously, all LXBs in the lgd_wait_event queue were resumed,
**	    at which time they called back in to LG_event() to get the current
**	    event mask and went back to sleep if the event(s) they were not
**	    interested in had not yet been signalled. This lead to a lot of 
**	    contention on lgd_status_mutex and the unnecessary resumption
**	    of threads.
**	    Now, only the LXBs which are actually waiting on the signalled
**	    event(s) are resumed, at which time they're presented with an
**	    up-to-date mask of all currently signalled events.
**	    Two new internal functions added, LG_suspend_event() and 
**	    LG_resume_event(), to deal specifically with the event wait queue.
**	19-Feb-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    LG_event() was taking a SHARE lock on lgd_status_mutex, then calling
**	    LG_suspend_event() to add its LXB to the event wait list. If multiple
**	    threads do this concurrently, corruption of the wait list may
**	    ensue because the event wait list relies on lgd_status_mutex
**	    to protect it. Changed to EXCL lock.
**	16-Nov-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Cross-process thread identity changed to CS_CPID structure
**	    from PID and SID.
**	19-Feb-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Added new functions LG_suspend_lbb(), LG_resume_lbb(). 
**      08-Dec-1999 (hanal04) Bug 97015 INGSRV 819
**          (hanje04) X-Integ of 444135 from oping20. Changed to E_DMA495
**          because E_DMA493 already exists in main.
**          Prevent process spins in LG_resume_event(), LG_resume() and
**          LG_resume_lbb() prevent process spins caused by the
**          end_offset exit condition never being met. There is an
**          underlying concurrency issue that will need to be addressed
**          if clients start seeing E_DMA493.
**	    Added new functions LG_suspend_lbb(), LG_resume_lbb().
**	24-Aug-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Dropped lgd_status_mutex, lfb_cp_mutex, use lgd_mutex instead.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	04-Oct-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Replaced CScp_resume() with LGcp_resume macro.
**	17-sep-2001 (somsa01)
**	    Due to lass cross-integration, changed nat's and longnat's to
**	    i4's. Also, added missing variable definition in LG_resume_lbb().
**	17-sep-2001 (somsa01)
**	    Backing out changes for bug 97015, as they are not needed in
**	    2.6+.
**	12-nov-2002 (horda03) Bug 105321 INGSRV 1502
**	    Following a user interrupt, iF LG_cancel() returns LG_CANCELGRANT, 
**	    then the lock request has been granted before it could be 
**	    cancelled. Rather than calling CScancelled(), call CSsuspend()
**	    as a resume is in the pipe-line. But just to be safe, suspend
**	    with a timeout.
**      12-Feb-2003 (hweho01)
**          Turned off optimizer for AIX hybrid build by using 
**          the 64-bit configuration string (r64_us5), because the    
**          error happens only with the 64-bit compiler option.  
**	08-Apr-2004 (jenjo02)
**	    Added "minitran" wait reason, corresponds to
**	    LXB_MINI_WAIT.
**      7-oct-2004 (thaju02)
**          Use SIZE_TYPE to allow memory pools > 2Gig.
**	15-Mar-2006 (jenjo02)
**	    lxb_wait_reason defines moved to lg.h, lgd_stat.wait
**	    cleaned up.
**	11-Sep-2006 (jonj)
**	    Add new "commit" wait reason for LOGFULL COMMIT.
**	6-Apr-2007 (kschendel) SIR 122890
**	    Use an intermediate for aliasing external i4 id's and LG_ID.
**	    Originally this was to fix gcc -O2's strict aliasing, but
**	    Ingres has so many other strict-aliasing violations that
**	    -fno-strict-aliasing is needed.  The id/LG_ID thing was so
**	    egregious, though, that I've kept this change.
**	09-Dec-2008 (jonj)
**	    SIR 120874: use new form uleFormat, CL_CLEAR_ERR.
**	03-Nov-2010 (jonj) SIR 124685 Prototype Cleanup
**	    Fix declaration of LG_resume_event()
**      13-Jul-2011 (hanal04) SIR 125458
**          Update cs_elog calls inline with sc0e_putAsFcn changes.

**          because the CScancelled() call doesn't delete the pending resume -

**	In general, the caller ought to be holding some sort of mutex
**	that blocks resumes on the same wait queue.  It's necessary
**	to make sure that the wait condition isn't fully cleared before
**	the LXB makes it onto the wait queue, because then nobody will
**	be left to resume this LXB once it goes onto the wait queue.
**	In some cases, the necessary mutex is sufficiently global
**	that we don't need the LWQ mutex;  for instance, this is the
**	case for the wait-for-free-buffers queue.  In other cases,
**	the resume-blocking mutex is less global in scope than the
**	wait queue, so we need the wait queue mutex.  An example of
**	the latter is the MINI wait, resume-protected by the SHARED
**	LXB mutex, but the mini-wait queue is global to the lgd.
**
**	Currently known wait queues and resume-protection mutexes:
**	- The LFB's wait-for-free-buffers queue needs the lfb_fq_mutex
**	- The LGD mini-stall queue needs the SHARED LXB mutex
**	- The LGD wait-stall queue for BCPSTALL or LOGFULL needs the lgd mutex
**	- The (same) LGD wait-stall queue for CKPDB stall needs the
**	  database's LDB mutex
**	- The LGD open-event queue needs the LDB mutex
**
**	At present, the LFB buffer-wait queue is the only one where we
**	can omit taking the LWQ mutex.  The lfb_fq_mutex fully protects
**	the LWQ in that case.
**
** Inputs:
**      lxb                             The LXB to suspend.
