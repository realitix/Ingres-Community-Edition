/**
**
**  Name: LGEND.C - Implements the LGend function of the logging system
**
**  Description:
**	This module contains the code which implements LGend.
**	
**	    LGend -- End this transaction in the logging system
**
**  History:
**	Summer, 1992 (bryanp)
**	    Working on the new portable logging and locking system.
**	16-oct-1992 (jnash) for rogerk
**	    Reduced logging project.  Removed references to obsolete 
**	    lgd->lgd_n_servers counter.  Change last_fc_server() refs
**	    to last_cp_server().
**	04-jan-1993 (jnash)
**	    Reduced logging project.  Free reserved log file space prior
**	    to destroying LXB.
**	15-mar-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Reduced Logging - Phase IV:  Removed EBACKUP database state.
**	17-mar-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Moved lgd status values to lgdstat.h so that they are visible
**	    by callers of LGshow(LG_S_LGSTS).
**	26-apr-1993 (andys/bryanp)
**	    Cluster 6.5 Project I
**		Renamed stucture members of LG_LA to new names. This means
**		    replacing lga_high with la_sequence, and lga_low with
**		    la_offset.
**		When we signal the backup to start, we record the current EOF in
**		    the ldb_sbackup field of the LDB. This will be used by
**		    higher-level DMF protocols to decide whether a page has
**		    been changed since the backup began. DMF, however, needs
**		    an LSN, not an LG_LA, to make this check, since it wishes
**		    to compare a log sequence number on a page against the LSN
**		    of the start of the backup. Therefore, we also set
**		    ldb->ldb_sback_lsn to be the most recent LSN that we have
**		    assigned.
**	14-jul-93 (ed)
**	    replacing <dbms.h> by <gl.h> <sl.h> <iicommon.h> <dbdbms.h>
**	26-jul-1993 (bryanp)
**	    When ending a logwriter thread, if it wasn't idle, perform its
**		assigned task(s) before removing it entirely.
**	    Include <tr.h>
**	26-jul-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Changed journal and dump window tracking in the logging system.
**	18-oct-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Removed obsolete LG_SESSION_ABORT handling.
**	    Took out descriptions of old unsupported flags values.
**	    Changed cleanup of recovered transactions.  Took out use of LG_RCP
**	    flag which used to indicate to clean up control blocks linked to
**	    the completed lxb.  We now only clean up parent control blocks
**	    for transactions marked orphaned.
**	18-oct-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Removed unused lgd_dmu_cnt, lxb_dmu_cnt fields.
**      31-jan-1994 (mikem)
**          bug #56478
**          0 logwriter threads caused installation to hang, fixed by adding
**          special case code to handle synchonous "in-line" write's vs.
**          asynchronous writes.  The problem was that code that scheduled
**          "synchronous" writes with direct calls to "write_block" did not
**          handle correctly the mutex being released during the call.  In the
**          synchronous case one must hold the LG mutex across the DIwrite()
**          call.  Added "release_mutex" argument to LG_do_write().
**	31-jan-1994 (bryanp) B56560
**	    When a logwriter is trying to clean up its unwritten blocks, if a
**		block cannot be written, the logwriter should return without
**		finishing the context cleanup. This allows some other process's
**		check-dead thread to give it a try.
**	31-jan-1994 (jnash)
**	    Fix lint detected problems: remove unused variables in 
**	    LG_end_tran(), initialize sys_err. 
**	05-Jan-1995 (jenjo02)
**	    Mutex granularity project. Semaphores must now be explicitly
**	    named in calls to LKMUTEX.C
**	18-Jan-1996 (jenjo02)
**          lbk_table replaced with lfbb_table (LFBs) and ldbb_table
**          (LDBs) to ensure that semaphores now embedded in those
**          structures are not corrupted. Similarly, sbk_table 
**          replaced with lpbb_table (LPBs), lxbb_table (LXBs), and
**          lpdb_table (LPDs).
**	27-Feb-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Rearranged code in LG_end_tran() so that first thing done
**	    is to remove LXB from its queues. This to avoid contention
**	    with other threads which may be walking those queues and
**	    are forced to wait on the lxb_mutex of the LXB being ended.
**	05-Sep-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Removed "release_mutex" argument from LG_do_write().
**	27-Sep-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Moved ldb_lxbo_count-- to where it's protected by the ldb_mutex.
**	13-Dec-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    ldb_lxbo_count now counts the number of non-READONLY protected 
**	    transactions, active or inactive.
**	15-Jan-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Fixed bad line of code in LG_end_tran which failed to detect
**	    orphaned LXBs.
**	11-Nov-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Redefined ldb_lxbo_count to include only active, protected
**	    transactions.
**      08-Dec-1997 (hanch04)
**        New block field in LG_LA for support of logs > 2 gig
**	17-Dec-1997 (jenjo02)
**	  o LG_do_write() loops while lxb_assigned_buffer, so there's no
**	    need to also do that here.
**	  o Replaced idle LogWriter queue with a static queue of all
**	    LogWriter threads.
**	24-Aug-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    When ending an active transaction, remove it from the
**	    active transaction hash queue.
**	24-Aug-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Dropped lgd_status_mutex, lfb_cp_mutex, use lgd_mutex instead.
**	    Renamed lgd_lxb_aq_mutex to lgd_lxb_q_mutex; there is no longer
**	    an "inactive" LXB queue; only active, protected txns appear
**	    on the LXB queue.
**	15-Dec-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Added support for SHARED transactions.
**	02-Feb-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Fixed 2 typos - LK_mutex/unmutex should be LG_mutex/unmutex -
**	    an innocuous goof.
**	14-Mar-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Removed static LG_end() function and the unnecessary level
**	    of indirection it induced. LGend() now does all the work.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**      12-Feb-2003 (hweho01)
**          Turned off optimizer for AIX hybrid build by using 
**          the 64-bit configuration string (r64_us5), because the    
**          error happens only with the 64-bit compiler option.  
**      10-May-2003 (hweho01)
**          Still need to turn off optimization for AIX 32-bit build.
**          Got error "E_DMA415_LGEND_BAD_ID" during creating iidbdb.
**          Compiler : VisualAge 5.023.
**      11-Jun-2004 (horda03) Bug 112382/INGSRV2838
**          Ensure that the current LBB is stil "CURRENT" after
**          the lbb_mutex is acquired. If not, re-acquire.
**      7-oct-2004 (thaju02)
**          Use SIZE_TYPE to allow memory pools > 2Gig.
**	20-Sep-2006 (kschendel)
**	    LG-resume call changed, update here.
**	6-Apr-2007 (kschendel) SIR 122890
**	    Use an intermediate for aliasing external i4 id's and LG_ID.
**	    Originally this was to fix gcc -O2's strict aliasing, but
**	    Ingres has so many other strict-aliasing violations that
**	    -fno-strict-aliasing is needed.  The id/LG_ID thing was so
**	    egregious, though, that I've kept this change.
**	09-Dec-2008 (jonj)
**	    SIR 120874: use new form uleFormat, CL_CLEAR_ERR.
**      13-Jul-2011 (hanal04) SIR 125458
**          Update cs_elog calls inline with sc0e_putAsFcn changes.
