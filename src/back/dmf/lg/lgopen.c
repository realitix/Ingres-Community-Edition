/**
**
**  Name: LGOPEN.C - Implements the LGopen function of the logging system
**
**  Description:
**	This module contains the code which implements LGopen.
**	
**	    LGopen -- Connect this process to the logging system
**
**  History:
**	Summer, 1992 (bryanp)
**	    Working on the new portable logging and locking system.
**	29-sep-1992 (nandak)
**	    Use one common transaction ID type.
**	12-oct-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Only the master must be given the block_size arg to LGopen. 
**	    Others can read the block_size from the LG_HEADER.
**	16-oct-1992 (jnash) for rogerk
**	    Reduced logging project.  Removed references to obsolete 
**	    lgd->lgd_n_servers counter
**	18-jan-1993 (bryanp)
**	    LG_logs_opened is now a GLOBALDEF.
**	    Call CL_CLEAR_ERR to clear the sys_err.
**	17-mar-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Moved lgd status values to lgdstat.h so that they are visible
**	    by callers of LGshow(LG_S_LGSTS).
**	26-apr-1993 (andys/bryanp/keving)
**	    Cluster 6.5 Project I:
**	    On the VAXCluster, we must append the nodename to the logfile name.
**	    When the process opens the log, call LGlsn_init.
**	    Renamed stucture members of LG_LA to new names. This means
**		replacing lga_high with la_sequence, and lga_low with la_offset.
**	    Set DI_SYNC_MASK when opening log files.
**	    Pass the block size to LG_open so that it can create buffers
**		of the correct size
**	    Initialize lpb_gcmt_sid.
**	24-may-1993 (andys)
**	    In form_path_and_file, use LO routines.
**	    In LGopen, deal better with the case where the primary logfile
**	    has vanished by using the dual logfile to find the logfile
**	    blocksize. This allows LGopen to (later) disable the primary 
**	    logfile correctly.
**	    In LGopen, correct off by one error where DIsense returns page 
**	    number and we want number of pages.
**	25-may-1993 (bryanp)
**	    If II_DUAL_LOG or II_DUAL_LOG_NAME isn't defined, this means the
**	    user isn't using dual logging. Don't complain, just use the primary.
**	21-jun-1993 (andys/bryanp)
**	    CSP/RCP process linkage: call LGc_csp_enqueue when opening log.
**	    Replace LG_NOHEADER with LG_LOG_INIT.
**	    If LG_LOG_INIT set, still try to open both logfiles...
**	21-jun-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Added LG_IGNORE_BOF flag to cause verify_header to do the logfile
**	    scan for bof_eof even if the logfile header status indicates that
**	    the bof/eof values in the header are valid.  This can be used by
**	    logdump to dump entire logfiles.
**	14-jul-93 (ed)
**	    replacing <dbms.h> by <gl.h> <sl.h> <iicommon.h> <dbdbms.h>
**	26-jul-1993 (bryanp)
**	    When the master opens a remote log, don't reset master_lpb if it's
**		already set -- this was causing the CSP to overwrite master_lpb
**		when it opened a remote log during node failure recovery.
**	    Include <tr.h>
**	26-jul-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Initialize new archive window fields.
**	23-aug-1993 (jnash)
**	    Include time and date in many TRdisplays.
**	18-oct-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Initialize new lpb_cache_factor field.
**	31-jan-1994 (mikem)
**	    Sir #57044
**	    Changed debugging logging of log file scans to print messages
**	    every 1000 buffers rather than every 100 buffers.  This makes
**	    the rcp log a little more readable.
**	31-jan-1994 (jnash)
**	  - In LG_verify_header(), verify that log page size passed in
**	    (if any) matches that cataloged in log file header.
**	  - Fix lint detected problem: remove unused "channel" variable in 
**  	    reconstruct_header().
**	15-feb-1994 (andyw)
**	    Removed iosb TRdisplay's from scan_bof_eof() & check_uneven_eof().
**	20-apr-1994 (mikem)
**	    bug #62034
**	    Fixed LG_verify_header to not return an error in the case of a
**	    mismatched blocksize between the on disk copy and the config.dat
**	    copy, if it was being called as part of "rcpconfig -init" (ie. to
**	    change the blocksize of the log file).
**	25-apr-1994 (bryanp) B61064
**	    Set lgk_mem.mem_creator_pid to the master's PID when the master
**		opens the log. This greatly reduces the problems associated
**		with the shared memory re-initialization code in LGK_initialize.
**		Under some circumstances, due to the timing of the various
**		subprocesses fired off by ingstart, the ingstart processing
**		completed leaving the installation up with the shared memory
**		owned by one of ingstart's subprocesses (one which was used to
**		run rcpstat, usually). By forcing the mem_creator_pid to be
**		set to the RCP's pid (the CSP's, in a cluster), we ensure that
**		the LGK_initialize re-formatting the shared memory code doesn't
**		accidentally fire.
**	23-may-1994 (bryanp) B58497
**	    Don't allow multiple local logfile opens with the same process PID.
**	12-jul-1995 (duursma)
**	    on VMS, call the new function NMgtIngAt() when translating 
**	    II_DUAL_LOG or II_DUAL_LOG_NAME
**      12-jun-1995 (canor01)
**          semaphore protect memory allocation (MCT)
**      13-jun-1995 (chech02)
**          Added LGK_misc_sem semaphore to protect critical sections.(MCT)
**	16-oct-1995 (nick)
**	    Add extra parameter to scan_bof_eof() to catch bug #71906.
**	05-Jan-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Mutex granularity project. Semaphores must now be explicitly
**	    named when calling LKMUTEX functions. Many semaphores added
**	    to suppliment the singular lgd_mutex.
**      03-jun-1996 (canor01)
**          New ME for operating-system threads does not need external
**          semaphores.
**	23-sep-1996 (canor01)
**	    Move global data definitions to lgdata.c.
**	23-sep-1997 (kosma01)
**	    The rs4_us5 platform keeps its pthread mutexes and condition
**	    variables on a chain and the chain is broken if a Ingres
**	    semaphore is moved as is done here for the DI ingres_log 
**	    semaphore.
**	14-Nov-1997 (hanch04)
**	    Reorder math to prevent overflow for files > 2 gig
**      08-Dec-1997 (hanch04)
**          Initialize new la_block field in LG_LA,
**	    Use new la_block field when block number is needed instead
**	    of calculating it from the offset
**	    for support of logs > 2 gig
**	18-Dec-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Added LG_my_pid GLOBAL. Removed GLOBALREFs and defines which 
**	    are already defined in lgdef.h.
**    30-Dec-1997 (hanch04)
**        lgh_begin should be lgh_end plus one block
**	26-Jan-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Partitioned Log File Project:
**	    Changed references to DI_IO to LG_IO, di_io to lg_io. Replaced
**	    DIread/write with LG_READ/WRITE macros.
**	    Replaced lpb_gcmt_sid with lpb_gcmt_lxb, removed lpb_gcmt_asleep.
**	01-sep-1998 (hanch04)
**	    Remove fall through for II_LOG_FILE from symbol table.  Only read
**	    it from config.dat or fail.
**      28-apr-1999 (hanch04)
**          Replaced STlcopy with STncpy
**	24-Aug-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Replaced SHARE lock of lgd_lpb_q_mutex with EXCL.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	29-may-2001 (devjo01)

**	    remove call to LGc_rcp_enqueue. (s103715)
**	11-feb-2002 (devjo01)
**	    Correct file open logic for when nodes have logs in
**	    different locations.
**	27-may-2002 (devjo01)
**	    Zero lfb_buf_cnt when initializing LFB.
**	24-oct-2003 (devjo01)
**	    replace LGcluster with CXcluster_enabled

**      7-oct-2004 (thaju02)
**          Use SIZE_TYPE to allow memory pools > 2Gig.
**	09-Dec-2008 (jonj)
**	    SIR 120874: use new form uleFormat, CL_CLEAR_ERR.
**      14-Jan-2010 (horda03) Bug 123153
**          Don't try to allocate buffers for node recovery

/*{
** Name: LGopen	- Open log file.
**
** Description:
**      This routine opens the log file for the current process establishing
**      a connection to the logger. If the caller specified the LG_MASTER flag,
**	then the log file can be initialized by the caller and the number of 
**	allocated blocks in the log file is returned.  Otherwise, if the log
**	file has not been initialized the caller will be returned an error.
**
**	The lg_id returned by this call is used in further calls to 
**	LGclose and LGadd.
**
**	If, prior to calling LGopen, the logging system has been set into
**	dual-logging mode via the proper LGalter() call, LGopen will open both
**	the primary log file and the dual log file and then (if this is the
**	master) will verify the two log files in tandem. In this process,
**	LGopen may discover that one of the two log files has previously
**	encountered an error (this will be marked in the log file headers). If
**	this is the case, or if any new errors are encountered during the dual
**	log opening and EOF scanning, LGopen will dynamically degrade the
**	system into dual-logging-with-single-active-log mode. All of this
**	special processing is performed by the LG_MASTER. Subsequent slave
**	opens will detect that only one log is active and will open only that
**	log.
**
**	Testpoint(s) implemented:
**	    LG_T_PRIMARY_OPEN_FAIL	if set, causes open of primary/only
**					log file to fail.
**	    LG_T_DUAL_OPEN_FAIL		if set, causes open of dual log file
**					to fail.
**	    LG_T_FILESIZE_MISMATCH	if set, causes log files to appear to
**					be different sized
** Inputs:
**      flag                            LG_MASTER
**					    This is the MASTER process. Only one
**					    such is allowed, and it is given
**					    special privileges. In addition,
**					    LGopen will perform special checks
**					    upon the log file header to ensure
**					    it is consistent with the log file.
**					LG_SLAVE
**					    Not a 'real' flag. Any process other
**					    than the MASTER is a slave.
**					LG_ARCHIVER
**					    This is the ACP. At most one of
**					    these is around.
**					LG_LOG_INIT
**					    It's ok to open the log file even
**					    if it can't be read. This flag
**					    should be used only by RCPCONFIG.
**					LG_PRIMARY_ERASE
**					LG_DUAL_ERASE
**					    Only used in conjunction with 
**					    LG_LOG_INIT, these flags indicate
**					    that only the specified logfile
**					    is to be opened.
**					LG_CKPDB
**					    This is a checkpoint process.
**					LG_FCT
**					    This process is a server which can
**					    use Fast Commit on databases, hence
**					    if it dies, REDO may (will) be done.
**					LG_HEADER_ONLY
**					    This process wishes to read the
**					    primary log's log file header but
**					    does not plan to actually use the
**					    log system. Therefore, the log file
**					    scan need not be performed, and the
**					    log file header should NOT be
**					LG_FULL_FILENAME
**					    nodename contains a fully-qualified
**					    filename. Used by standalone
**					    logdump.
**					LG_IGNORE_BOF
**					    Used by logdump to dump entire log
**					    files in standalone processing.
**					    Directs the logging system to ignore
**					    the BOF in the log header and to
**					    scan the log file to find the log
**					    sequence number transition point
**					    to use as the starting BOF.
**                                      LG_PARTITION_FILENAMES
**                                          Used to indicate that nodename is an
**                                          array of LG_PARTITIONs, signifying that
**                                          the LGopen is to open a partitioned Logfile.
**                                          l_nodename will hold the number of partitons.
**
**	nodename			Pointer to file name or LG_PARTITION.
**	l_nodename			Length of file name or number of partitons.
**	block_size			Blocksize to open the file with.
**
** Outputs:
**      lg_id                           Log file identifier.
**	blks				Number of blocks allocated if called
**					by the master, dmfrcp.
**      sys_err                         Reason for error return status.
**	Returns:
**	    OK
**	    LG_RESOURCE		    No resources available.
**	    LG_NOTLOADED	    LG system is not available.
**	    LG_CANTOPEN		    Error opening log file.
**
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	    none
**
** History:
**	Summer, 1992 (bryanp)
**	    Working on the new portable logging and locking system.
**	12-oct-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Only the master must be given the block_size arg to LGopen. Others can read
**	    the block_size from the LG_HEADER.
**	18-jan-1993 (bryanp)
**	    Call CL_CLEAR_ERR to clear the sys_err.
**	16-feb-1993 (bryanp)
**	    When the master opens the local log, call LGlsn_init.
**	26-apr-1993 (bryanp)
**	    Set DI_SYNC_MASK when opening log files.
**	24-may-1993 (andys)
**	    Deal better with the case where the primary logfile
**	    has vanished by using the dual logfile to find the logfile
**	    blocksize. This allows us to (later) disable the primary 
**	    logfile correctly.
**	    Correct off by one error where DIsense returns page number
**	    and we want number of pages.
**	25-may-1993 (bryanp)
**	    If II_DUAL_LOG or II_DUAL_LOG_NAME isn't defined, this means the
**	    user isn't using dual logging. Don't complain, just use the primary.
**	21-jun-1993 (andys/bryanp)
**	    CSP/RCP process linkage: call LGc_csp_enqueue when opening log.
**	    Replace LG_NOHEADER with LG_LOG_INIT.
**	    If LG_LOG_INIT set, still try to open both logfiles...
**	    Initialize local_status to zero.
**	23-aug-1993 (andys)
**	    Correct number of args in ule_format(E_DMA47F_LGOPEN_SIZE_MISMATCH..
**	31-jan-1994 (jnash)
**	    Add block_size parameter to LG_verify_header() call.
**	25-Jan-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Removed acquisition and freeing of lgd_mutex.
**	26-Jan-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Partitioned Log File Project:
**	    Added code to handle multiple log partitions.
**	24-aug-1998 (hanch04)
**	    Partitioned Log File Project:
**	    Changed from log file names to log file locations.
**	28-Mar-2005 (jenjo02)
**	    For clusters, delay buffer allocation until after
**	    the log header has been tidied up; LG_allocate_buffers()
**	    presumes the header is valid. Also increase the number
**	    of buffer from 3 to the worst case, based on LG_MAX_RSZ.
**      13-jun-2005 (stial01)
**          For clusters, store node name in lfb
**	22-Nov-2005 (jenjo02)
**	    Add DI_DIRECTIO_MASK to open logs with
**	    directio when available.
**      30-Oct-2009 (horda03) Bug 122823
**          logdump standalone can be used to view a TX log file, but
**          then the TX log file is partitioned, need a way of supplying
**          the partiton file names. If LG_PARTITION_FILENAMES set, then
**          nodename and l_nodename will refer to the partiton filenames.
**	23-Jul-2008 (kschendel) SIR 122757
**	    Control log file directIO with direct_io_log param.
**	10-Feb-2010 (kschendel) SIR 122757
**	    Default for direct_io_log should be OFF.

/*{
** Name: LG_open	- Open log file
**
** Description:
**      This routine creates the internal data structures that
**	describe a process opening a log file.  The caller that
**	passes the LG_MASTER flag is consider the owner of the
**	file.  It is the responsiblity of the master to assure the
**	consistency of the log information.
**
**	    (Actually, the notion of "master" is flawed and overloaded. Once
**	    the RCP is up and running, the RCP is the master of the logging
**	    system, and the RCP's state is tracked closely. The lgd_master_lpb
**	    field always points to the RCP's LPB, and various places in the
**	    logging system use this to locate the RCP's information. When the
**	    RCP is NOT up, things are more iffy. In particular, various
**	    processes such as rcpconfig, dmfcsp, and logdump may at times
**	    masquerade as the master in order to trick the logging system into
**	    allowing them to connect and open log files when the RCP is not up.
**	    In fact, the dmfcsp process may open multiple log files as the
**	    "master"; in fact, it may do this while the RCP is already up, in
**	    a node failure recovery scenario!
**
**	    We treat the LG_MASTER flag specially if a non-zero node name is
**	    passed, for this is the case where the dmfcsp process is opening a
**	    remote log. If this occurs before the RCP is up, then the dmfcsp
**	    process temporarily assumes the role of master; if it occurs after
**	    the RCP is up, then the dmfcsp does not disturb the RCP's proper
**	    role as master. Temporarily assuming the role of master is ugly,
**	    but it is necessary in order for the rest of the logging system to
**	    operate properly.)
**
**	If LG_DUAL_LOG is set in 'flag', then both log files have been opened
**	by this process. Otherwise, we assume that only one file (we don't
**	know whether primary or dual) has been opened.
**
**	We set lgd_active_log at this point to indicate the current active
**	log(s); this may be changed later either dynamically or through a
**	call to LGalter().
**
** Inputs:
**      flag                            Either:
**					    LG_SLAVE: Normal requestor.
**					    LG_ARCHIVER: Archiver process.
**					    LG_MASTER: Recovery process.
**					        (or rcpconfig or logdump...)
**					    LG_CKPDB: Ckpdb process.
**					    LG_DUAL_LOG : open the dual log.
**	nodename			Pointer to file name.
**	l_nodename			Length of file name.
**
** Outputs:
**      lg_id                           The assigned log indentifier.
**	Returns:
**	    LG_I_NORMAL			Successful.
**	    LG_I_BADPARAM		Bad parameter.
**	    LG_I_INSFMEM			Out of LPB's.
**	    LG_I_SHUT			Logging system shutdown.
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	    none
**
** History:
**	Summer, 1992 (bryanp)
**	    Working on the new portable logging and locking system.
**	16-oct-1992 (jnash) for rogerk
**	    Reduced logging project.  Removed references to obsolete 
**	    lgd->lgd_n_servers counter
**	23-oct-1992 (bryanp)
**	    I'm not sure how useful the LG_BADFILENAME check is, and it's not
**	    working correctly in a dual logging world (if the master opens both
**	    logs and sets lgd_filename to primary, then primary fails, then any
**	    subsequent server starts are refused because they try to pass the
**	    dual filename in and it doesn't match the primary filename). Thus,
**	    I have taken out the LG_BADFILENAME return for now.
**	26-apr-1993 (bryanp)
**	    Initialize lpb_gcmt_sid.
**	26-jul-1993 (bryanp)
**	    When the master opens a remote log, don't reset master_lpb if it's
**	    already set -- this was causing the CSP to overwrite master_lpb
**	    when it opened a remote log during node failure recovery. Instead,
**	    only the local master will set master_lpb.
**	26-jul-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Initialize new archive window fields.
**	18-oct-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Initialize new lpb_cache_factor field.
**	25-apr-1994 (bryanp) B61064
**	    Set lgk_mem.mem_creator_pid to the master's PID when the master
**		opens the log. This greatly reduces the problems associated
**		with the shared memory re-initialization code in LGK_initialize.
**		Under some circumstances, due to the timing of the various
**		subprocesses fired off by ingstart, the ingstart processing
**		completed leaving the installation up with the shared memory
**		owned by one of ingstart's subprocesses (one which was used to
**		run rcpstat, usually). By forcing the mem_creator_pid to be
**		set to the RCP's pid (the CSP's, in a cluster), we ensure that
**		the LGK_initialize re-formatting the shared memory code doesn't
**		accidentally fire.
**	23-may-1994 (bryanp) B58497
**	    Don't allow multiple local logfile opens with the same process PID.
**	25-Jan-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Multiple semaphores replace singular lgd_mutex. Also relocated
**	    code linking new LPB into active queue until AFTER its been
**	    completely initialized:)
**	    Added lgd_archiver_lpb to hold pointer(offset) of Archiver's
**	    LPB.
**	26-Jan-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Partitioned Log File Project:
**	    We may now be opening multiple physical files per log.
**	27-may-2002 (devjo01)
**	    Zero lfb_buf_cnt when initializing LFB (cannot just zero entire
**	    structure, since certain portions (e.g. mutexes) are preserved
**	    between uses).
**	30-Apr-2003 (jenjo02)
**	    Removed 25-apr-1994 (bryanp) B61064 change to assign
**	    mem_creator_pid to the RCP's pid, no longer needed
**	    due to changes made for BUG 110121.
**	28-Mar-2005 (jenjo02)
**	    For clusters, delay buffer allocation until after
**	    the log header has been tidied up; LG_allocate_buffers()
**	    presumes the header is valid.

** Name: LG_verify_header	- Read , verify and rebuild the log header.
**
** Description:
**      This routine verifies that the log header is intact.  If not
**	it attempts to reconstruct relevant portions of the log header
**	by reading the log file.
**
**	This routine is invoked only by the log master (typically the RCP, but
**	also by RCPCONFIG in 'LG_LOG_INIT' mode).
**
**	If the system has only one active log, our job here is fairly straight
**	straightforward:
**	    1) Read the header, if possible. It's recorded twice.
**	    2) If we can't read the header, re-construct it.
**	    3) If the EOF position of the file is in doubt (due to a previous
**		system crash), scan the log file and determine the correct EOF.
**		If there is a partially-written log record at the end of the
**		log, back up to before that record.
**
**	If there are dual logs, then our job is complicated by the following:
**	    1) Header file analysis must check both log file headers, and must
**		use the one with the greater timestamp (the system may have
**		crashed after writing one but before writing the other).
**	    2) The header of the log file(s) may indicate that one of the log
**		files is disabled due to having encountered I/O errors. This
**		log file should then be dynamically disabled.
**	    3) The system may have crashed in the middle of writing one of the
**		log files (i.e., after writing one log but before/during
**		writing of the other log). In this case, we should complete the
**		partial write by copying the good record to the damaged file to
**		bring the files back into sync.
**	    4) During the header reads and EOF scan, an I/O error on one file
**		should dynamically fail-over to the other file. HOWEVER, if we
**		get I/O errors or bad check-sums on BOTH log files, we will
**		refuse to re-construct the header. This situation is judged to
**		be SO dire that header re-construction is not desirable. Note
**		that the headers are written synchronously, and thus we never
**		have an opening where a power failure/system crash could damage
**		both headers in ordinary processing.
**
**	LG_verify_header can be logically divided into three parts:
**	1) header reading and checking.
**	2) header re-construction (never performed for dual-logging).
**	3) EOF determination.
**
** Inputs:
**	flag		- the LGopen flags, possibly augmented. Most of the
**			  flags are ignored, but these are interesting:
**			LG_LOG_INIT - log file will be re-initialized. Don't
**				      scan the log file; it's not needed.
**			LG_DUAL_LOG - dual logging is active, and both log
**				      files have been opened.
**			LG_HEADER_ONLY - log files must be opened, but only the
**				      header need be processed.
**			LG_ONELOG_ONLY- only one logfile is being opened, so
**				      the dual logging cross-checks are not
**				      needed (this is used by standalone
**				      logdump).
**			LG_IGNORE_BOF - ignore the BOF value in the log header
**				      and always scan the log file to find
**				      the log sequence number transition point
**				      to use as the new BOF.
**
**	blocks		- size of the log file(s), in LGD_MIN_BLK_SIZE units.
**	blocksize	- log file block size, in bytes.
**	log_to_disable	- passed through to read_headers to allow it to
**			  perform better edit checking on the log file headers.
**
** Outputs:
**	header		- the (updated and verified) log file header.
**
** Returns:
**	OK		- all went well, header is usable.
**	LG_DISABLE_PRIM - primary log is unusable, and needs to be de-activated
**	LG_DISABLE_DUAL - dual log is unusable, and needs to be de-activated.
**
** History:
**	Summer, 1992 (bryanp)
**	    Working on the new portable logging and locking system.
**	21-jun-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Added LG_IGNORE_BOF flag to cause verify_header to do the logfile
**	    scan for bof_eof even if the logfile header status indicates that

/*
** Name: read_headers	- header reading and checking for LG_verify_header()
**
** Description:
**	This routine is called from LG_verify_header to read and check the
**	log file header(s).
**
**	If dual logging is enabled, we will check the headers to see if one
**	of the log files has encountered an I/O error in a previous lifetime.
**	If so, we will tell our caller to disable that log.
**
**	Note that if dual logging is enabled, LG_RECONSTRUCT will never be
**	returned. This is a conscious design decision.
**
**	If dual_logging is disabled, our work is simple:
**	    1) read the header from block 1 (virtual blocks count from 1)
**	    2) if that header can't be read or fails to checksum properly,
**		read the header from block 3
**	    3) if neither header could be read properly, return LG_RECONSTRUCT,
**		else check to see that the header says "active log is primary"
**		and then return OK.
**
**	If dual_logging is enabled, our work is more complicated:
**	    1) read the primary header from block 1 or 3 if possible.
**	    2) read the dual header from block 1 or 3 if possible.
**	    3) if both headers are OK, pick the one with higher timestamp and
**		return either OK or a disable code, depending on what the
**		header information says.
**	    4) if neither header was readable, return LG_CANTOPEN
**	    5) pick the header which was readable
**	    6) If the unusable header was due to an I/O error, disable that
**		log by returning the appropriate disable code, else return
**		OK (thus recovering, in effect, from a bad header write in the
**		previous crash.
**
**	If dual logging was previously enabled, but we were only able to read
**	one log file, then we proceed as for the single-logging case; however,
**	if the log file header indicates that only the "other" log file was
**	previously active, we return CANTOPEN. This case, a highly special
**	one, is encountered when the RCP cannot open one of the log files after
**	being brought back up following a period of dual logging. This is the
**	reason for the 'disabled log' parameter.
**
**	We attempt to verify that the version number field in the logfile
**	header matches the version number with which we were compiled. However,
**	the checksum algorithm uses the size of the LG_HEADER structure in its
**	checksum calculation. This means that if you change the size of the
**	LG_HEADER structure (for example, by adding a new member), then the new
**	code will compute a checksum using the new LG_HEADER size, but the
**	logfile headers written with the old LG_HEADER version will not
**	checksum properly. Therefore, attempts to use version numbers to catch
**	changes in the size of the structure are problematic. This is why we
**	check the version number even when the checksum fails.
**
** Inputs:
**	flag		    Many ignored flags, but in particular:
**			    LG_DUAL_LOG	    - dual logging is enabled, so read
**					      and check both log files.
**			    LG_HEADER_ONLY  - don't reconstruct header.
**			    LG_ONELOG_ONLY  - allow open of just 1 log file in
**					      a dual logging system (for
**					      standalone logdump usage).
**	disabled_log	    This field is only relevant if LG_DUAL_LOG is off,
**			    and serves to distinguish between 3 cases:
**			    DISABLE_NO_LOG	- we are truly single logging,
**				and the header should confirm this.
**			    DISABLE_PRIMARY_LOG	- we were previously dual
**				logging, but the II_LOG_FILE could not be
**				opened, and so the header should indicate
**				BOTH ACTIVE or DUAL ACTIVE -- PRIMARY ACTIVE
**				is an error.
**			    DISABLE_DUAL_LOG	- we were previously dual
**				logging, but the II_DUAL_LOG could not be
**				opened, and so the header should indicate
**				BOTH ACTIVE or PRIMARY ACTIVE -- DUAL ACTIVE
**				is an error.
**
** Outputs:
**	header		    the log file header to use
**
** Returns:
**	OK		    no problems encountered.
**	LG_RECONSTRUCT	    header is unusable, and must be re-constructed.
**	LG_DISABLE_PRIM	    header is ok, but primary log cannot be used.
**	LG_DIABLE_DUAL	    header is ok, but dual log cannot be used.
**	LG_CANTOPEN	    dual logging enabled, but neither header usable.
**			    OR, dual logging disabled, but primary log header
**			    indicates dual logging was ENabled.
**
** History:
**	Summer, 1992 (bryanp)
**	    Working on the new portable logging and locking system.
**	10-Nov-2009 (kschendel) SIR 122757
**	    Dynamically allocate (and align) the buffer for reading the
**	    header.  It's potentially large, and this is only done at

/*
** Name: reconstruct_header	- perform single-log header reconstruction.
**
** Description:
**	If LG_LOG_INIT is on, this routine is called with an empty log file
**	and should simply build a default LG_HEADER structure and return.
**
**	Otherwise, this routine is called to attempt recovery from a bad file.
**	When dual logging is not enabled, we run the risk that a power failure
**	or system crash during a header write may leave the header useless. If
**	that occurs, we attempt to re-construct the header information. For
**	most of the information, we can simply pick a sensible default. For
**	the log file page size, we make an attempt to deduce the log file
**	page size by testing each of the possible page sizes until we get one
**	that matches.
**
**	This routine is NOT currently called for dual logging. If dual logging
**	is enabled but neither file's header is readable, we decline to attempt
**	any reconstruction of the headers. This decision may need to be
**	re-thought.
**
** Inputs:
**	flag	    - if LG_LOG_INIT is on, just build default header.
**	blocks	    - size of the log file.
**
** Outputs:
**	header	    - log file header
**
** Returns:
**	OK	    - header rebuilt successfully
**	LG_READERROR- log file is unreadable.
**
** History:
**	5-jun-1990 (bryanp)
**	    Spun out of verify_header for dual_logging support.
**	5-jul-1990 (bryanp)
**	    Set lgh_timestamp and lgh_active_logs in default header.
**	12-oct-1990 (bryanp)
**	    Updates for Unix support.
**	29-sep-1992 (nandak)
**	    Use one common transaction ID type.
**	31-jan-1994 (mikem)
**	    Sir #57044
**	    Changed debugging logging of log file scans to print messages
**	    every 1000 buffers rather than every 100 buffers.  This makes
**	    the rcp log a little more readable.
**	31-jan-1994 (jnash)
**	    Fix lint detected problem: remove unused "channel" parameter. 
**	19-Apr-2005 (schka24)
**	    Fudge low half of tran-id forward from "now" in case tx had
**	    been running more than one per second; for Replicator.
**	10-Nov-2009 (kschendel) SIR 122757
**	    Make sure I/O buffer is aligned.

        ** the checksum routine returns a different value depending on

        ** of code is that we read each block in the log, one at a time.
        ** For each such block, we try each of the possible block sizes,
        ** from smallest to largest. If at any instant we find a block
        ** and a blocksize where the block's checksum matches the LGchk_sum
        ** result for that blocksize, we have a potential blocksize. If
        ** we ever confirm that blocksize by observing a second correct
        ** checksum (on a subsequent block), then we accept that as the
        ** correct blocksize.
        **
        ** Variables:
        **    seq   - current position in the log file (we advance
        **            LGD_MAX_BLK_SIZE bytes at a time).
        **    cbsize- candidate blocksize, awaiting confirmation.
        **    bsize - the thing we're trying to calculate.
        **    size  - a blocksize variable.
        **    j     - the number of 'little' blocks to overlay on the
        **            current 'big' block.
        **    i     - the current 'little' block counter.
        **    b     - the current 'little' block pointer, used to overlay
        **            a potential little block on this big block.
	**
	** Initially, we assume the block size is LGD_MAX_BLK_SIZE.
	**
	** This algorithm HOPES to terminate by setting 'bsize' to a likely
	** blocksize. It may, however, read all the blocks in the file, at
	** which point 'seq' will become too big and we'll attempt an out of
	** bounds read and return with LG_READERROR. I don't think that this

/*
** Name: check_uneven_eof	- handle EOF inconsistencies in dual logging
**
** Description:
**	This routine is called to deal with recovering from failures in which
**	one log got written but the other did not. In the future this routine
**	might be expanded to deal with a much tougher problem if we ever
**	allow multiple pending I/O's on the logs.
**
**	At the point we are called we have located the apparent EOF in the
**	primary log file. There are 3 possibilities we must deal with:
**	1) The dual log has precisely the same EOF. In this case, all is fine,
**	    and we simply return to our caller.
**	2) The dual file was written further than the primary file. For some
**	    period of time before the system came down, the dual log was in
**	    use but the primary was not. In this case, we need to advance down
**	    the dual file until we reach its EOF. As we go, we must copy the
**	    dual pages over to the primary, thus completing write(s) which were
**	    not performed before the crash. There is the high probability that
**	    we will encounter an error writing the primary in this case, since
**	    might have disabled the primary just before the crash occurred.
**	3) The opposite of (2) -- the primary was written farther than the dual.
**
**	The algorithm as currently implemented allows for a multi-block
**	discrepancy between the primary and dual EOF positions, and repairs
**	such as discrepancy (by copying blocks from one log to the other), but
**	it CANNOT handle "holes" in the log file. That's OK -- we never have
**	multiple outstanding I/O's against a single log file, but you should
**	keep this limitation in mind.
**
**	We DO checksum some of the  pages we read in this routine. A page which
**	fails to checksum properly is treated as though it didn't get written
**	at all.  Not only does this simplify the logic, it may allow us to
**	recover from more I/O errors.
**
** Inputs:
**	header		    - current log header
**	seq		    - seq number of previous page of primary log.
**	buffer_primary	    - current log page from primary log
**	eof_block	    - current position in the primary log (i.e., block
**			      number of the page in the primary log which had
**			      a lower sequence number than the previous page)
**
** Outputs:
**	buffer_primary	    - overwritten. Don't count on its contents.
**	eof_block	    - possibly incremented to next log "page"
**
** Returns:
**	OK		    - EOF's have been reconciled
**	LG_DISABLE_PRIM	    - primary has become unusable, disable it
**	LG_DISABLE_DUAL	    - dual has become unusable, disable it.
**	LG_CANTOPEN	    - unrecoverable error
**
** History:
**	8-jun-1990 (bryanp)
**	    Began.
**	7-aug-1990 (bryanp)
**	    Enhancements to allow a multi-block discrepancy in the EOF to be
**	    detected and repaired.
**	5-sep-1990 (bryanp)
**	    Checksum some pages we read in this routine, and treat a page which
**	    doesn't checksum as though it didn't get written at all.
**	12-oct-1990 (bryanp)
**	    Updates for Unix support.
**	31-jan-1994 (mikem)
**	    Sir #57044
**	    Changed debugging logging of log file scans to print messages
**	    every 1000 buffers rather than every 100 buffers.  This makes
**	    the rcp log a little more readable.
**	15-feb-1994 (andyw)
**	    Removed iosb as this is never used/assigned
**	10-Nov-2009 (kschendel) SIR 122757
**	    Make sure I/O buffer is aligned.
**	06-Jul-2010 (jonj) SIR 122696
**	    Check bookends to ensure page completely written.

** Name: cross_check_logs	- sanity checking when dual logging is enabled
**
** Description:
**	This routine is called when the LG_MASTER opens the logging system
**	with dual logging support enabled. We have opened both files and have
**	already verified that the files are the same size; the point of this
**	routine is to make more sophisticated internal checks. We do the
**	following:
**
**	As a safety check, we demand that the following fields be
**	    identical in the two headers:
**
**	    lgh_version	    ( version of the log file )
**	    lgh_size	    ( log file page size      )
**	    lgh_count	    ( number of pages in log  )
**	    lgh_status	    ( log file status         )
**	    lgh_tran_id	    ( last transaction ID used)
**	    lgh_begin	    ( last begin of file      )
**	    lgh_end	    ( last end of file        ) -- checked in (1)
**	    lgh_cp	    ( last consistency point  )
**	    lgh_active_logs ( mask of active logfiles )
**
**	    If the two log files differ in any of these, something must be
**	    DREADFULLY wrong!
**
**	    These values may not be *correct*, but they should be the same.
**	    Subsequent code will potentially update the header.
**
** Inputs:
**	header_primary	    - LG_HEADER from the primary log file
**	header_dual	    - LG_HEADER from the dual log file
**
** Outputs:
**	None
**
** Returns:
**	OK		    - headers cross-check without error
**	LG_DUALLOG_MISMATCH - headers don't match. Something is hosed.
**
** History:
**	31-may-1990 (bryanp)
**	    Created.

**	nodename	    - name of the node whose logfile is needed, on
**			      a clustered installation, or NULL if the
**			      local logfile is needed.
**
** Outputs:
**	file_name	    - filled in with logfile name
**	l_file_name	    - filled in with filename length
**	path		    - filled in with just the "path", if non-zero

**	16-feb-1993 (bryanp)
