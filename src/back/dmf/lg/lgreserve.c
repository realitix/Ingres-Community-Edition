/**
**
**  Name: LGRESERVE.C - Implements the LGreserve function of the logging system
**
**  Description:
**	This module contains the code which implements LGreserve.
**
**	External Routines:
**
**	    LGreserve -- Reserve space for a subsequent log write.
**
**	Internal Routines:
**
**	    LG_reserve
**
**  History:
**	07-jan-1993 (jnash)
**	    Created for the Reduced Logging project.
**	18-jan-1993 (jnash)
**	    Loosen parameter checking, add CL_CLEAR_ERR().
**	08-feb-1993 (jnash)
**	    ANSI-ize function defintion.
**	15-mar-1993 (jnash & rogerk)
**	    Add a "i4 factor" for each record reserved.
**	    Added LXB_NORESERVE flag.
**	17-mar-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Moved lgd status values to lgdstat.h so that they are visible
**	    by callers of LGshow(LG_S_LGSTS).
**	14-jul-93 (ed)
**	    replacing <dbms.h> by <gl.h> <sl.h> <iicommon.h> <dbdbms.h>
**	26-jul-1993 (bryanp)
**	    Include <tr.h>
**	20-sep-1993 (jnash)
**	    Add "force_flag" param to LGreserve().
**	18-oct-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Changed to pass flag parameter down to the LG_reserve call so
**	    the logspace reservation logic can be encapsulated into one place.
**	    Added LG_calc_reserved_space routine for this encapsulation.
**	20-jun-1994 (jnash)
** 	    Fix lint detected problems: remove unused variables i, rec_ohead,
**	    buf_ohead.
**	05-Jan-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Mutex granularity project. Semaphores must now be explicitly
**	    named when calling LKMUTEX functions. Several new new
**	    semaphores added to keep lgd_mutex company.
** 	16-Jan-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Explicitly state CS_LOG_MASK in CSsuspend() calls.
**	18-Jan-1996 (jenjo02)
**          lbk_table replaced with lfbb_table (LFBs) and ldbb_table
**          (LDBs) to ensure that semaphores now embedded in those
**          structures are not corrupted. Similarly, sbk_table 
**          replaced with lpbb_table (LPBs), lxbb_table (LXBs), and
**          lpdb_table (LPDs).
**	06-mar-1996 (stial01 for bryanp)
**          Modify LGreserve edit checking to allow for reservation of space
**          for very long log records.
**	23-sep-96 (nick)
**	    Recast some of our stat counters to unsigned.
**	11-Mar-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Removed Nick's log reservation changes which attempted to factor
**	    in "wasted" space per log record. Inaccurate at best, it abetted
**	    log space reservation creep, resulting in bogus DMA490/DMA491
**	    warnings.
**	15-Mar-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Return LG_CKPDB_STALL error if txn is becoming active and needs
**	    to be stalled for CKPDB.
**	24-Aug-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Dropped lgd_status_mutex, lfb_cp_mutex, use lgd_mutex instead.
**	25-Aug-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Defeat LG_RS_FORCE which seems to serve no purpose other than
**	    to eat copious amounts of log space.
**	15-Dec-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Add support for shared log transactions (LXB_SHARED/LXB_SHARED_HANDLE).
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**      12-Feb-2003 (hweho01)
**          Turned off optimizer for AIX hybrid build by using 
**          the 64-bit configuration string (r64_us5), because the    
**          error happens only with the 64-bit compiler option.  
**      7-oct-2004 (thaju02)
**          Use SIZE_TYPE to allow memory pools > 2Gig.
**	6-Apr-2007 (kschendel) SIR 122890
**	    Use an intermediate for aliasing external i4 id's and LG_ID.
**	    Originally this was to fix gcc -O2's strict aliasing, but
**	    Ingres has so many other strict-aliasing violations that
**	    -fno-strict-aliasing is needed.  The id/LG_ID thing was so
**	    egregious, though, that I've kept this change.
**	09-Dec-2008 (jonj)
**	    SIR 120874: use new form uleFormat, CL_CLEAR_ERR.
**      13-Jul-2011 (hanal04) SIR 125458
**          Update cs_elog calls inline with sc0e_putAsFcn changes.

/*{
** Name: LGreserve	- Reserve logfile space for subsequent LGwrite.
**
** Description:
**	In order to manage logfull calculations, normal log writes must be 
**	preceded by calls to LGreserve to reserve space in the log file.
**	Log writes that have compensating actions (that log
**	a Compensation Log Record (CLR) during transaction undo) must 
**	also reserve space for the CLR.  Space may be reserved for more
**	than one log write in a single call.  Log writes performed 
**	during recovery do not generally need to reserve space --
**	is has already been reserved prior to the action which is
**	being compensated.
**
** 	This action is taken outside LGwrite because recovery algorithms 
**	require that page mutexes be held throughout the call to LGwrite, 
**	ensuring that no one modifies the page between the log write and 
**	the insertion of the LSN onto the page.  
**
**	A normal sequence of actions would be:
**	    LGreserve()
**	    dm0p_mutex(page) 
**	    LGwrite()
**	    page->page_lsn = lsn
**	    dm0p_unmutex() 
**
**	If no space is available in the log file, LGreserve will wait 
**	for it to become available.  This routine does not currently
**	include an option to not wait for reserved space to become 
**	available, but this ability may prove useful in the future.
**
**	The force flag is used to reserve an entire log buffer for
***	use in the recovery of that operation.  This is the worst case
**	situation, but represents the easiest way to deal with this
**	situation.
**	
** Inputs:
**	lx_id				Transaction identifier.
**	flag				Zero, no special action
**					  LG_RS_FORCE, reserve 1 log buffer
**	res_space			The amount of space to reserve
**	num_records			Number of log records
**
** Outputs:
**	sys_err				CL error
**	Returns:
**	    OK
**	    LG_BADPARAM                 Parameter(s) in error.
**	    LG_WRITEERROR               Error reserving space.
**	    LG_BADMUTEX			Bad LG mutex operation
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	Caller will be suspended if no log space is available.
**
** History:
**	07-jan-1993 (jnash)
**          Created for the Reduced logging project.
**	20-sep-1993 (jnash)
**	    Add flag param, currently used to indicate a log force 
**	    is required during recovery.  In response, reserve 
**	    an additional log buffer's worth.
**	18-oct-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Changed to pass flag parameter down to the LG_reserve call so
**	    the logspace reservation logic can be encapsulated into one place.
** 	16-Jan-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Explicitly state CS_LOG_MASK in CSsuspend() calls.
**	25-Jan-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Removed acquisition and freeing of lgd_mutex.
**	06-mar-1996 (stial01 for bryanp)
**	    Modify LGreserve edit checking to allow for reservation of space
**		for very long log records.
**	29-jul-96 (nick)
**	    Add some calculations to reflect the factor by which log file
**	    space is unused and then take that into account when determining
**	    amount to reserve. #77308

**	Reserve space in log file for log record(s) about to be written.
**	If there is no space available and requested to wait, then
**	call suspend() here and return warning.  If caller does not wish
**	to wait for space to be freed, return warning.
**
**	Space reserved by this routine is freed by: 
**	   LG_write() will free whatever it writes (except CLR reservations),

**
**	Note that log writes performed by the RCP are not made within BT/ET

**	15-mar-1993 (jnash & rogerk)
**	    Include i4 space adjustment for all records.
**	    Added LXB_NORESERVE flag.  Transactions which specify this will
**		make updates without reserving space.  If one of these
**		transactions makes an LGreserve call, ignore the request
**		since the reservation will not be decremented on write requests.
**	18-oct-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Changed to pass flag parameter down to the LG_reserve call so

**	    Moved checks for check_stall limit into the LG_check_logfull
**	    routine itself rather than checking before the call.
**	25-Jan-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Several new mutexes added to augment lgd_mutex.
**	15-Mar-1999 (jenjo02)

/*{
** Name: LG_calc_reserved_space	- Calculate required logspace reservation.
**
** Description:
**	This routine takes a request for a logspace reservation for a certain
**	number of bytes and log records and computes the amount of logfile 
**	space (in bytes) needed to satisfy the logspace reservation protocols.
**
**	It takes into account the overhead for record headers, log buffer
**	headers, consistency points and known and possible log buffer forces 
**	during recovery.
**
**	Some of the overhead calculations round up to make sure that at least
**	one byte is allocated for that overhead.  Without this we might never
**	reserve space in some of the calculations because the computation
**	would yield less than 1 byte per log record.  When we do round up
**	in these calculations, it must be by 'num_records' amount rather than
**	by 1 byte to make the logspace calculations more deterministic.
**
**	This routine should be deterministic in the following way:
**
**	    The sum of the results of the calls:
**
**		LG_calc_reserved_space(1 record, J bytes);
**		LG_calc_reserved_space(1 record, K bytes);
**
**	    Must be equivalent to the result of the call:
**
**		LG_calc_reserved_space(2 records, J + K bytes);
**
**	This is because LGreserve will be called once to reserve space for
**	both the normal log record and its CLR.  As the log records are written
**	individually the space will be given back in two sets.
**
**	As it turns out however, since this routine does integer arithmetic
**	it cannot be completely deterministic because of truncations when
**	division is done.  It is possible that the sum of the two calls above
**	will return a value less than the single call below it.  This is
**	the preferred direction of the flaw since it will cause our xacts to
**	accumulate small amounts of extra reserved log space rather than
**	creeping in the direction of losing reserved space.  (The note above
**	about always using 'num_records' when rounding up calculations ensures
**	that the creep is in the positive direction).
**
**	In addition, there are factors outside our control for which we need
**	to account ; in group_commit scenarios ( or rather lack of ) log
**	writes don't actually write out 100% full buffers.  The ultimate
**	effect of this is that the space we reserve is insufficient to permit
**	successful recovery in some situations ( especially when we are 
**	aborted due to logfile limits ).  This make the calculation even less
**	deterministic.
**
** Inputs:
**	lxb				Transaction context
**	num_records			Number of log records
**	log_bytes			The amount of log record needed
**	flag				Reserve options:
**					LG_RS_FORCE - caller indication that a
**					    logforce will be required to undo
**					    the operation for which the log
**					    record space reservation is being
**					    done.  This causes an additional
**					    buffer-size amount of bytes to be
**					    tacked onto the reservation.
**
** Outputs:
**	Returns:
**	    space_needed		Amount of bytes needed to reserve
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	    none
**
** History:
**	18-oct-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Created.
**	21-jun-96 (nick)
**	    Add some calculations to increase the reserved space to 
**	    account for the 'dead' space contained in the log buffers.
**	23-sep-96 (nick)
**	    Cast some things I added in the above change to unsigned.  This
**	    is a short term change as I'm in the process of redesigning
**	    this to remove dependency on long-term stats. and make the
**	    calculation more responsive to short term changes.
**	11-Mar-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Removed Nick's log reservation changes which attempted to factor
**	    in "wasted" space per log record. Inaccurate at best, it abetted
**	    log space reservation creep, resulting in bogus DMA490/DMA491
**	    warnings.
**	    The calls to LG_calc_reserved_space() from LGreserve() and 
**	    LGwrite() must come up with the same number. Introducing 
**	    a variable into the computation can cause the reserved space
**	    to creep and, for very long running transactions, lead to 
**	    artificial DMA490/DMA491 warnings in the log.
**	25-Aug-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Defeat LG_RS_FORCE which seems to serve no purpose other than
**	    to eat copious amounts of log space.
**	30-Apr-2004 (jenjo02)
**	    Brought back LG_RS_FORCE. MODIFY of large number of 
**	    partitions writes a ton of forced FCREATE and FRENAME
**	    log records, causing recovery to run off the end of
**	    the log.
**	06-Jul-2010 (jonj) SIR 122696
**	    Include LG_BKEND_SIZE in page overhead.

    ** We note that they are slightly more predictable in offline recovery
    ** situations when there are no other cache users complicating the issue,
    ** but even then it is not completely deterministic.
