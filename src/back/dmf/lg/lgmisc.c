/**
**
**  Name: LGMISC.C -- Miscellaneous support routines for LG
**
**  Description:
**	This file contains various LG subroutines which didn't seem to fit in
**	anywhere else.
**
**
**  History:
**	Summer, 1992 (bryanp)
**	    Working on the new portable logging and locking system.
**	16-oct-1992 (jnash) merged 29-jul-1992 (rogerk)
**	    Reduced Logging Project: Changed actions associated with some of
** 	    the Consistency Point protocols. The system now requires
**	    that all servers participate in Consistency Point flushes, not
**	    just fast commit servers:
**            - Added notion of CPAGENT process status.  This signifies that
**              the process controls a data cache that must be flushed when
**              a consistency point is signaled.  Currently, all DBMS servers
**              will have this status and no other process type will.
**            - Added alter entry point LG_A_CPAGENT which causes the CPAGENT 
**              process status to be defined in the current process.  
**            - Changed the LG_A_BCPDONE case to signal the CPFLUSH event if 
**              there are any CPAGENT servers active rather than just 
**              fast commit ones.  
**            - Changed LG_check_fc_servers name to LG_check_cp_servers.
**            - Changed LG_last_fc_server name to LG_last_cp_server.
**            - Removed references to obsolete lgd->lgd_n_servers counter.
**	17-nov-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Added LGidnum_from_id() to extract the ID portion of an LG id.
**	    Currently, this function is used only by the archiver.
**	03-jan-1993 (jnash)
**          Reduced Logging project. 
**	      - Include lgd_reserved_space in used logspace calculation in 
**		LG_check_logfull().  Add LG_used_logspace() routine, now used 
**		when inquiring minds want to know.
**	      - In LG_set_bof(), defer decision to turn off archiving, logfull 
**		and force abort until we have determined that BOF has moved 
**		forward.
**	18-jan-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Changed name of LG_set_bof to LG_archive_complete.
**	15-mar-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Reduced Logging - Phase IV:
**	    Removed system EBACKUP, FBACKUP and database EBACKUP states.
**	17-mar-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Moved lgd status values to lgdstat.h so that they are visible
**	    by callers of LGshow(LG_S_LGSTS).
**	26-apr-1993 (andys)
**	    Cluster 6.5 Project I
**	    Renamed stucture members of LG_LA to new names. This means
**	    replacing lga_high with la_sequence, and lga_low with la_offset.
**	24-may-1993 (bryanp)
**	    Fix arguments to PCforce_exit(). This fixes some shared cache
**		rundown problems.
**	24-may-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Fixed problem in LG_archive_complete which cause hanging in 
**	    online backup operations.
**	14-jul-93 (ed)
**	    replacing <dbms.h> by <gl.h> <sl.h> <iicommon.h> <dbdbms.h>
**	26-jul-1993 (bryanp)
**	    Fix a problem in LG_compute_bof() when transactions from both local
**		and remote logs are simultaneously active.
**	    Include <tr.h>
**	26-jul-1993 (rogerk)
**	  - Changed journal and dump window tracking in the logging system.
**	    The journal and dump windows are now tracked using the actual
**	    log addresses of the first and last records which define the
**	    window rather than the address of the CP previous to those
**	    log records.  Added a new field - lfb_archive_window_prevcp - 
**	    which gives the consistency point address before which we know 
**	    there is no archiver processing required.  Consolidated the system
**	    journal and dump windows into a single lfb_archive_window.
**	  - Changed LG_archive_complete routine to reset the journal and dump
**	    windows using the archiver stopping address and to store the
**	    previous CP address.
**	  - Changed LG_compute_bof to use the new archive_window_prevcp value.
**	  - Include respective CL headers for all cl calls.
**	23-aug-1993 (bryanp)
**	    Added support to LG_force_abort for man-abort of prepared xacts.
**	18-oct-1993 (bryanp)
**	    Added get_critical_sems implementation, patterned on 6.4 one.
**	18-oct-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Added LG_orphan_xact and LG_adopt_xact routines.
**	    Added argument to LG_used_logspace to indicate whether or not
**	    to include reserved logspace.
**	04-jan-1994 (chiku)
**          Changed LG_chekc_logfull() to call LG_unmutex() before PCExit() on 
**          logfull conditions.  [BUG#: 56702].
**	31-jan-1994 (jnash)
**	    Fix lint detected problem: remove unused declaration of
**	    check_archive_off().
**	15-apr-1994 (chiku)
**          Bug56702: Changed LG_chekc_logfull() to return E_DM9070_LOG_LOGFULL on
**          logfull conditions.
**	20-jul-1995 (canor01)
**	    LG_force_abort() should pass an SCB to the abort_handler instead
**	    of a SID
**	05-Jan-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Mutex granularity project. Semaphores must now be explicitly
**	    named when calling LKMUTEX functions.
**	14-mar-96 (nick)
**	    Replace LK_mutex() and LK_unmutex() with LK_get_critical_sems()
**	    and LK_rel_critical_sems() respectively.
**	29-Mar-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Lock appropriate LG semaphores in get|rel_critical_sems().
**	29-May-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Added lxb parm to LG_check_logfull() to pass to  LG_abort_oldest().
**	    LG_abort_oldest() may abort the LXB which is running the
**	    current thread, in which case its mutex is already locked -
**	    the function needs to know that.
**	08-Oct-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    In get_critical_sems, rel_critical_sems, call CSp|v_semaphore
**	    directly instead of using LG_mutex|unmutex to avoid cluttering
**	    the log with misleading errors.
**	13-Nov-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    When resetting back status in LDB, also reset LDB_STALL_RW
**	    flag (new).
**      08-Dec-1997 (hanch04)
**          Initialize new block field in LG_LA 
**          Calculate number of blocks from new block field in LG_LA 
**          for support of logs > 2 gig
**	18-Dec-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Added LG_my_pid GLOBAL.
**	16-Nov-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Cross-process thread identity changed to CS_CPID structure
**	    from PID and SID.
**	15-Mar-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Removed LDB_STALL_RW flag.
**      23-Jun-99 (hweho01)
**          Added *CS_find_scb() function prototype. Without the 
**          explicit declaration, the default int return value   
**          for a function will truncate a 64-bit address
**          on ris_u64 platform.
**	03-Mar-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    As part of fix for BUG 98473, ensure that LG_abort_oldest()
**	    allows a single force-abort to take place at a time.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	16-Apr-1999 (hanch04)
**	    Call CSfind_scb, not CS_find_scb
**	24-Aug-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Dropped lgd_status_mutex, lfb_cp_mutex, use lgd_mutex instead.
**	    lfb_current_lbb_mutex replaced by individual LBB's lbb_mutex.
**	    Dropped lgd_lxb_aq_mutex and inactive LXB queue.
**	    lgd_wait_free and lgd_wait_split queues consolidated into
**	    lgd_wait_buffer queue.
**	15-Dec-1999 (jenjo02)
** 	    Added support for SHARED transactions. When force-aborting
**	    any participant, all must be force-aborted.
**	04-Oct-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Deleted CS_find_scb() prototype.
**	    Replaced CScp_resume() with LGcp_resume macro.
**      01-aug-2002 (jenjo02)
**          LG_abort_transaction: Init lxbq, before referencing it (b108439)
**      22-oct-2002 (stial01)
**          LG_abort_transaction: fixed loop through shared transaction handles
**          Added LG_xa_abort().
**      7-oct-2004 (thaju02)
**          Use SIZE_TYPE to allow memory pools > 2Gig.
**      31-Mar-2005 (horda03) Bug 114192 / INGSRV 3224
**          When a Dead process is identified, before releasing the
**          lgd->lgd_lpb_q_mutex, set the LPB_DEAD flag to prevent other
**          servers trying to Rundown the same process.
**      31-Mar-2006 (stial01)
**          LG_archive_complete() Moved JSWITCH processing here.
**          Always send LG_E_ARCHIVE_DONE.
**	20-Sep-2006 (kschendel)
**	    LG-resume calls changed, update here.
**	6-Apr-2007 (kschendel)
**	    Remove LGidnum_from_id, not used anywhere.
**	16-Aug-2007 (kibro01) b118626
**	    Add status check so repq manager can detect that a transaction
**	    has entered the force-abort state
**      28-feb-2008 (stial01)
**          LG_check_dead() Check for lone logwriter sleeping & unassigned bufs
**	07-Aug-2009 (drivi01)
**	    In order to port to Visual Studio 2008, cleanup the warnings.
**	03-Nov-2010 (jonj) SIR 124685 Prototype Cleanup
**	    Delete non-conforming LG_status_is_abort() function.
**	    Those that need to know this must use LGshow().
**	11-Nov-2010 (kschendel)
**	    CS_xxx_critical_sems exists on VMS as well as unix, change the
**	    conditional.
**      13-Jul-2011 (hanal04) SIR 125458

/*{
** Name: LG_archive_complete	- Mark completion of archive event.
**
** Description:
**	This routine is called via LGalter by the archiver whenever
**	an archive cycle is completed.
**
**	It updates the database and system dump and journal windows
**	and moves the Log File BOF forward if possible.
**
**	Its input is two log addresses: the log address at which archive
**	processing stopped; and the last CP encountered by the archiver 
**	during the most recent archive pass.
**
**	Each database journal and dump window is moved up to reflect the
**	archive work just completed (the start of each window is moved
**	up forward to the archiver completion address).  Any dump or journal
**	window for which the archiver completion address beyond the end
**	window address is reset to zero.
**
**	The system archive window is moved up to reflect the new union of
**	all database journal and dump windows.
**
**	The system archive_window_prevcp is set with the value given by
**	the archiver as the address of the last Consistency Point encountered 
**	during the archive scan.  If the archiver provided value is not set
**	then the current archive_winodow_prevcp value is preserved.  This
**	address will be used by the LG_compute_bof call which is made here
**	to determine how far up the Log File BOF can be moved.
**
**	This routine also does post-purge database processing.  A database
**	which is in PURGE state and has just had its journal window closed
**	has a CLOSEDB action signaled for it.
**
** Inputs:
**	acp_stopping_lga		Log Address to which the ACP did
**					archive processing.
**	acp_last_cp			Last Consistency Point encountered by
**					the acp during its archive pass. May
**					be zero if no CP's were encountered.
**
** Outputs:
**	Returns:
**	    VOID
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	    none
**
** History:
**	Summer, 1992 (bryanp)
**	    Working on the new portable logging and locking system.
**	03-jan-1993 (jnash)
**	    Reduced logging project.  Defer decision to turn off
**	    archiving, logfull and force abort until it has been determined
**	    that BOF has moved.
**	18-jan-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Changed name from LG_set_bof.
**	15-mar-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Reduced Logging - Phase IV:
**	    Removed ONLINE PURGE database state.
**	24-may-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Changed comparisons using purge log address to take into account
**	    that the purge address includes the last processed record.  So that
**	    if the purge address is exactly equal to the database's jnl or
**	    dmp window end then the window has been completely processed.
**	    Failure to do this caused online backup on an unopen database to
**	    stall because the checkpoint process thought the dump window never
**	    got fully archived.
**	26-jul-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Changed journal and dump window tracking in the logging system.
**	    The journal and dump windows are now tracked using the actual
**	    log addresses of the first and last records which define the
**	    window rather than the address of the CP previous to those
**	    log records.  Added a new field - lfb_archive_window_prevcp - 
**	    which gives the consistency point address before which we know 
**	    there is no archiver processing required.  Consolidated the system
**	    journal and dump windows into a single lfb_archive_window.
**	23-Jan-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Mutex granularity project. Lock LFB and LDB mutexes.
**	16-Feb-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    LG_signal_event() call incorrectly indicated lgd_mutex was held 
**	    by this function; it should indicate it's not lest a deadlock
**	    ensue.
**	19-Jul-2001 (jenjo02)
**	    Wrap updating of archive window log addresses with lgd_mutex
**	    instead of ldb_mutex and lgd_mutex. This closes a hole 
**	    in which lfb_archive_window_start could assume a value
**	    that is not the union of all open databases, leading to
**	    DM9845 failures in the archiver.
**	21-Mar-2002 (jenjo02)
**	    If ldb_type != LDB_TYPE, don't restart queue, just
**	    keep going.
**	22-Jul-2005 (jenjo02)
**	    Fix race condition exposed by MAC port. Ensure that
**	    LDB's are mutexed before checking status.
**	01-Nov-2006 (jonj)
**	    Using consistent ldb_q, ldb mutex ordering throughout the
**	    code means we can take and hold the ldb_q and mutex LDBs
**	    without deadlock danger. Remove "release the LDB, remutex
**	    the queue" entanglements.

/*{
** Name: LG_compute_bof - Compute new BOF and signal archiver if necessary
**
** Description:
**	This routine is called when we may have done something to allow
**	us to move the logfile BOF forward.  This includes:
**
**	    - ending the oldest transaction
**	    - completing a conisistency point
**	    - completing an archive cycle
**
**	It should be safe, however, to call this routine at any time.  If
**	none of the above have been done, the routine will just have no
**	result.
**
**	The log file BOF should be the minimum of the following:
**	    1)	The address of the BCP before the oldest active transaction
**		(if there is one) - given by lgd_lxb_next->lxb_cp_lga.
**	    2)	The address of the latest BCP record written - given by
**		lgd_header.lgh_cp.
**	    3)	The address of the BCP before the start of the current
**		archive window - given by lfb_archive_window_prevcp.
**
**	If there are journaled transactions to archive and the correct number
**	of CP's have been executed then wake up the archiver.
**
**	The number of CP's to execute before waking up the archiver is given
**	by the parameter 'archive_interval'.  This will generally be the
**	user-setable lgh_cpcnt.  In some cases, however, this routine may
**	be called to start the archiver if there is anything that can be
**	archived - when the log is full or when the RCP is aborting
**	transactions.  In this case, 'archive_interval' will be zero.
**
** Inputs:
**	archive_interval  - The size of the archive window at which to invoke
**			    the archiver.  Specified in number of blocks.
**
** Outputs:
**	Returns:
**	    None
**	Exceptions:
**	    None
**
** Side Effects:
**	None

** History:

**	26-jul-1993 (bryanp)
**	    Fix a problem in LG_compute_bof() when transactions from both local
**		and remote logs are simultaneously active.
**	26-jul-1993 (rogerk)
**	  - Changed to use the new lfb_archive_window_prevcp as the address
**	    to which we can move the BOF without upsetting archive processing.
**	    We now move the BOF to the lesser of this value and the oldest
**	    transaction prev_cp value.
**	  - Also changed the logic which decides whether to signal the
**	    archiver to use the lfb_archive_window to determine the amount

** Name: LG_check_dead() - Find any processes that have abnormally exited.

**	Run throught the logging systems process list and find check by

**	necessary for any process which does not cleanup in the normal
**	fashion (ie. processes that that are killed with "-9", or that
**	are exited while in the debugger).
**
**	With the fast commit changes, the the LPB may or may not be
**	deleted by LG_rundown().  This makes looping through the LPB list
**	while calling LG_rundown() much more difficult.  In order to 
**	simplify this problem, LG_check_dead quits after it has found the
**	first dead pid.  Any other pid's will be found the next time we
**	check (ie. 5 seconds later).  Abnormal server death had better be
**	an rare event, or there are other things to fix.
**
** OUTSTANDING PROBLEM:
**
**	Some of the dbutil utilities only connect to the LK system rather than
**	the LG system.  These programs will never be found by the following
**	routine if they abnormally exit (this should only happen in the kill
**	-9 case as PCatexit() should call the rundown handlers in other cases).

** Name: get_critical_sems	    - get installation critical resources.
**
** Description:
**	This routine is used by LG_rundown when it wants to kill off
**	selected servers without bringing down the entire installation.
**
**	To do this, LG must make sure that when it kills a server, that the
**	server is not holding any system critical semaphore - otherwise the
**	installation could be left in a corrupted state.
**
**	To ensure that the servers will not be holding any system semaphores
**	when they die, this routine collects all such semaphores on behalf
**	of the calling process.
**
**	Currently there is no CL registry of critical resources, nor is there
**	any mainline registry. This routine takes its best shot by acquiring
**	the following critical semaphores:
**
**	    LG_mutex		    : held by our caller already.
**	    LK_mutex		    : to lock out locking system activities.
**	ifdef UNIX
**	    Cs_sm_cb->css_spinlock  : to lock out CS shmem activities.
**	endif
**
**	Other semaphores which we might need to consider holding include:
**
**	    Lgk_mem->mem_ext_sem    : to lock out internal LG/LK memory mgt
**
**	Currently, we do not bother to acquire these semaphores because these
**	semaphores are only taken while also holding either the LG_mutex or the
**	LK_mutex, so we argue that we've locked them out effectively already.
**
**	Based on testing, we may need to add additional semaphores to the list.

/*{
** Name: LG_check_logfull - Check for logfull/force_abort conditions
**
** Description:
**      This routine is called whenever the log is full enough (greater
**      than lgd_checkstall) to warrant checking for logfull or force-abort
**      conditions.
**
**      If we have reached the force_abort limit, then we must find the oldest
**      transaction in the system and signal it to be aborted.
**
**      If we have reached the logfull limit, then we must stall the logging
**      system until logspace is freed up.  Usually this means until the oldest
**      transactions get aborted.  (Note that if we hit logfull we will signal
**      force_abort even if we have not actually reached the force_abort limit).
**
**      Logfull is computed in one of two ways.  First there is an installation
**      startup parameter that gives the logfull limit. Usually it will be set
**      to around 95% of the logfile size.  When the logfill becomes this full,
**      then LOGFULL will be signaled.
**
**      Secondly, the logging system keeps track of how much logspace would
**      be required to recover all of the active transactions in the system
**      should a machine failure occur.  These reqirements are described below.
**
**      Should the logfile reach a limit that exceeds either of the two logfull
**      limits, then LOGFULL will be signaled.
**
**      Should the logging system recognize that it is approaching a logfull
**      condition while executing a consistency point, it will stall the logging
**      system until the CP is complete.  This is because filling up the logfile
**      during a CP often leads to force-aborting all active transactions
**      (a result of moving the logfile BOF marker only by CP boundaries).
**      If we stall the logging system for this reason, we will not signal
**      force_abort.
**
**
**      Requirements for computing dynamic logfull limit.
**
**          The logging system must make sure that there is always enough space
**          to recover all the active transactions.  This requires there to be
**          available:
**
**	   	- space to writes CLRs for all updates in all active 
**		  transactions, reflected by lgd_reserved_space and
**		  (factored as part of the used logspace below).
**
**              - one log buffer for each active transaction.  This is
**                required to write and force each End Transaction record.
**
**              - one log buffer for each active DMU operation.  This is
**                required so the system can write and flush a DM0L_ABORTSAVE
**                record each time it completes recovery on a DMU operation.
**
**              - two log buffers in order to execute two Consistency Points.
**                It may be necessary to write and flush ECP records in order
**                to reclaim space for transactions after being recovered.
**
**              - six more buffers; for no particular reason, just to be safe.
**                Just in case someone adds something that requires more disk
**                space without altering this algorithm, we get a little leeway
**                to notice it internally before we corrupt anybody's database.

**	Summer, 1992 (bryanp)
**	    Working on the new portable logging and locking system.
**	03-jan-1993 (jnash)
**          Reduced Logging project.   This project adds more complexity in 
**	    logfull calculations, and we haven't yet worked out solutions 
**	    to all the problems.  Basically, it becomes critical that 
**	    we know exactly what logging takes place writes after LOGFULL 
**	    (the "real" logfull -- not the CP stall) has been signalled.   
**	    This project includes reserved space to that previously 
**	    noted, and also includes one additional log buffer for each 
**	    CP that may be performed during transaction backout,
**	    with the reserved space to estimate the number of CPs.
**	    This is not perfect as CPs are variable length.
**	    A more difficult problem, not resolved here, can be viewed
**	    at its most pathological by considering a 1 page cache.  Then,
**	    each page touched during recovery causes the buffer manager 
**	    to force another page to make room.  These forces play havoc 
**	    with the space reservation mechanism, and so far we have no 
**	    solution.  We just assume for now that the cache is large 
**	    enough that this doesn't occur.
**	18-oct-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Changed to return immediately if the used space is below the
**	    check-stall limit.  Put this check in here and removed the similar
**	    check-stall check from the current callers of check_logfull.
**	    Added new logfull checking calculations.  Removed accounting
**	    for CPs in recovery as this is now done by LG_calc_reserved_space.
**	    Removed use of lgd_dmu_cnt as its function was superseeded by
**	    logspace reservation in 6.5.  Added local computation of the
**	    lgd_stall_limit, it is no longer used outside of this routine.
**	    Added new checks for logfile size growing during logfull conditions
**	    and we now crash the installation if the logfile gets near the
**	    point at which it will wrap around.
**	04-jan-1994 (chiku)
**          Changed LG_chekc_logfull() to call LG_unmutex() before PCExit() on 
**          logfull conditions.  [BUG#: 56702].
**	15-apr-1994 (chiku)
**          Bug56702: Changed LG_chekc_logfull() to return E_DM9070_LOG_LOGFULL on
**          logfull conditions.
**	24-Jan-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    New mutexes for LFB, queues, and other structures.
**	    Added lgd_archiver_lpb so we don't have to lock and search
**	    the lpb queue to find the Archiver's LPB.
**	29-May-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Added lxb parm to LG_check_logfull() to pass to  LG_abort_oldest().
**	    LG_abort_oldest() may abort the LXB which is running the
**	    current thread, in which case its mutex is already locked -
**	    the function needs to know that.
**	02-Mar-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Compute lgd_stall_limit using lgd_protect_count (number of active
**	    transactions) rather than lgd_lxb_inuse (number of active and
**	    inactive transactions). Only active ones will need space for
**	    an ET.
**	5-Jan-2006 (kschendel)
**	    Reserved space totals change to u_i8 for large logs, fix here.

    **		one log buffer for each active transaction (to ensure we can
    **		force the ET records) and add in an arbitrary fudge factor.
    **
    **		When this limit is reached new LGreserve requests will hang

    **		logspace are able to continue (rollbacks for example).

    **		Set to 98% of the logfile size.  If the used + reserved space
    **		space reaches this amount in an online system, then the system
    **		will be brought down to attempt offline recovery.
    **
    **		The hope is that this limit can never be reached since:
    **
    **		  - The Logfull Stall Point must be before this, and no new
    **		    space can be reserved after that limit is reached.
    **
    **		  - During LOGFULL, the only log writes that are allowed are
    **		    those associated with rollback processing which should be
    **		    using up already reserved space.
    **
    **		If the used-space amount increases during LOGFULL conditions
    **		then it may be sign that the logspace reservation algorithms
    **		are not working properly and we are using up logspace faster
    **		than expected.
    **
    **		We shut down and fail over to offline recovery with the hope
    **		that in that more controlled environment we will waste less
    **		log space.  We do not want to reach condition (C) below.
    **
    **       C) lgd_death_limit: Total devastation
    **
    **		Set to 100% of the logfile size (minus 5 blocks).
    **
    **		If the actual used space (not reserved) reaches this limit
    **		then we are toast.  We stop processing (even in offline
    **		recovery) to avoid wrapping around the log file and writing
    **		over important log records.
    **
    **		When this happens the user must initialize the logfile.
    **
    **		The 5 blocks are left around in the hopes that we can write
    **		a mechanism that can bring the system up without recovering
    **		databases so we can archive out the current logfile.  If we
    **		can archive the journal records then at least the user can
    **		rollforward the open databases to recover them.

** Name: LG_cleanup_checkpoint - Clean up backup state on database.
**
** Description:
**	This routine is used to clean up the system and database backup
**	states following the exit of a checkpoint process - or the change
**	in state of a database undergoing backup.
**
**	If called with an LPB parameter, then the process passed in should
**	be a checkpoint process which is exiting.  The database it has
**	open is checked for necessary cleanup - that is turning off the
**	BACKUP states if no other checkpoint is running on it.
**
**	It then checks whether the system backup status needs to be reset.
**	If there are no other checkpoints running in the system, then the
**	system backup state is turned off.
**
**	This routine can be called with a Zero LPB argument just to calculate
**	the appropriate system backup status based on status values of
**	the currently open databases.
**
** Inputs:
**	lpb		    Process control block of exiting process.
**
** Outputs:
**	Returns:
**	    None
**	Exceptions:
**	    None
**
** Side Effects:
**	None
**
** History:
**	Summer, 1992 (bryanp)
**	    Working on the new portable logging and locking system.
**	15-mar-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Reduced Logging - Phase IV:
**	    Removed system EBACKUP, FBACKUP and database EBACKUP states.
**	24-Jan-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    New mutexes. If called with LPB, lpb_mutex assumed to be held.
**	13-Nov-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    When resetting back status in LDB, also reset LDB_STALL_RW
**	    flag (new).
**	15-Mar-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Removed LDB_STALL_RW flag.
**	26-Apr-2000 (thaju02)
**	    Turn off LDB_CKP_LKRQST. (B101303)
**      08-jun-2005 (horda03) Bug 114666/INGDBA322
**          Need to hold the lgd_ldb_q_mutex until the lgd_status flag
**          is cleared. If this mutex isn't held, then a DB could be
**          flaged LDB_BACKUP and switch on LGD_CKP_SBACKUP after the
**          ldb_status for the DB has been checked by this process. If
**          this was the only DB which is being backed up, then this
**          routine will clear the LGD_CKP_SBACKUP flag anf the other

** Name: LG_used_logspace		- find amount of used logspace
**
** DescriptionL:
**      This routine is used to fine the amount of currently used logfile 
**	space, including space reserved for the recovery system (if indicated).
**
** Inputs:
**	LFB			Logging system context
**	include_reserved	Indicates whether to include reserved log
**				file space as well as written space.
**
** Outputs:
**      The amount of used logspace in blocks.
**
** History:
**      03-jan-1993 (jnash)
**          Created as part of Reduced logging project.
**	26-apr-1993 (bryanp)
**	    Cluster support: logfile information is now in the LFB structure.
**	18-oct-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Tried to change calculations to not overflow on MAXI4 sized
**	    log files.  Moved checks for negative lfb_reserved space to
**	    to lgwrite/lgreserve routines.
**	    Added argument to LG_used_logspace to indicate whether or not
**	    to include reserved logspace.
**	24-Jan-1996 (jenjo02)
**	    Mutex granularity project. 
**	    This is done using a dirty read of lfb_header, so the 
**	    result may be an approximation.
