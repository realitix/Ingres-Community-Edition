**
**  Name: LGERASE.C - Implements the LGerase function of the logging system
**
**  Description:
**	This module contains the code which implements LGerase.
**	
**	    LGerase -- Erase the logfile
**
**  History:
**	Summer, 1992 (bryanp)
**	    Working on the new portable logging and locking system.
**	29-sep-1992 (nandak)
**	    Use one common transaction ID type.
**	18-jan-1993 (bryanp)
**	    The task of formatting a fresh log file has been taken over by
**	    iiconfig. LGerase now merely formats and writes the logfile header.
**	    Call CL_CLEAR_ERR to clear the sys_err.
**	17-mar-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Moved lgd status values to lgdstat.h so that they are visible
**	    by callers of LGshow(LG_S_LGSTS).
**	26-apr-1993 (andys/bryanp)
**	    Cluster 6.5 Project I
**	    Renamed stucture members of LG_LA to new names. This means
**	    replacing lga_high with la_sequence, and lga_low with la_offset.
**	    Attempt to be more intelligent about which logs to format. If the
**	    caller says to initialize both logs, but only one log was
**	    was successfully opened, then just initialize that log.
**	21-jun-1993 (andys)
**	    Add lg_id parameter to LGerase to help rcpconfig open other
**	    logfiles on the cluster. Use lfb_status to discover which DI_IO
**	    control blocks to use.
**	14-jul-93 (ed)
**	    replacing <dbms.h> by <gl.h> <sl.h> <iicommon.h> <dbdbms.h>
**	23-aug-1993 (bryanp)
**	    On the cluster, cram the cluster's node ID into the high part of
**		the tran ID so that tran ID's on different nodes of the cluster
**		are always unique.
**	    Also, removed a redundant extra computation of the check sum.
**	31-jan-1994 (jnash)
**	    Fix lint detected problems: remove lga in LGerase. 
**      12-jun-1995 (canor01)
**	    semaphore protect memory allocation (MCT)
**      13-jun-1995 (chech02)
**          Added LGK_misc_sem semaphore to protect critical sections.(MCT)
**	18-Jan-1996 (jenjo02)
**          lbk_table replaced with lfbb_table (LFBs) and ldbb_table
**          (LDBs) to ensure that semaphores now embedded in those
**          structures are not corrupted. Similarly, sbk_table 
**          replaced with lpbb_table (LPBs), lxbb_table (LXBs), and
**          lpdb_table (LPDs).
**      03-jun-1996 (canor01)
**          New ME for operating-system threads does not need external
**          semaphores.
**    08-Dec-1997 (hanch04)
**        Initialize new block field in LG_LA and lgh_last_lsn in
**        the log header for support of logs > 2 gig
**	26-Jan-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Partitioned Log File Project:
**	    Replace DIread/write with LG_READ/WRITE macros, DI_IO structures
**	    with LG_IO structures.
**	26-apr-1999 (hanch04)
**	    Added casts to quite compiler warnings
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**      12-Feb-2003 (hweho01)
**          Turned off optimizer for AIX hybrid build by using 
**          the 64-bit configuration string (r64_us5), because the    
**          error happens only with the 64-bit compiler option.  
**      18-feb-2004 (stial01)
**          Fixed incorrect casting of length arguments.
**      7-oct-2004 (thaju02)
**          Use SIZE_TYPE to allow memory pools > 2Gig.
**	09-Dec-2008 (jonj)
**	    SIR 120874: use new form uleFormat, CL_CLEAR_ERR.
**      13-Jul-2011 (hanal04) SIR 125458
**          Update cs_elog calls inline with sc0e_putAsFcn changes.

/*{
** Name: LGerase	- Zero out the log file.
**
** Description:
**      This routine erases the log file to contain only null data.
**	The log file must have been LGopen()ed prior to this call.
**
**      It is CRITICALLY important that log file sequence numbers be
**      ever-increasing. Log file addresses are stored by client code in
**      the database config file, and if a particular log file ever gets
**      re-initialized and starts to get lower log file addresses, horrid
**      things happen to the database. In order to ensure that log file
**      addresses are never set lower, this routine assigns the high-order
**      32 bits of beginning log file address (the sequence number) as
**      follows:
**          1) We get the current system time, and massage it slightly so
**              that it's roughly the number of seconds since 1970. This is
**              a rough calculation, but it does produce a greater value
**              each time it's called (so long as the user doesn't reset the
**              system clock and the seconds doesn't overflow 32 bits).
**          2) If possible, we check the previous value of the log file's
**              sequence counter. This field is not available if the log
**              file has never been initialized, or if this is FORCE_INIT, but
**              if neither of those hold we retrieve the previous sequence
**              counter value and force the new sequence field to be greater
**              than the previous value.
** Inputs:
**	lg_id				Transaction id.
**	lx_id				Not used.
**	bcnt				Buffer count in terms of block size.
**	bsize				block size.
**	force_init			Force erase the log file even if there
**					are outstanding transactions.
**	logs_to_initialize		indicator of which logs to initialize.
**					LG_ERASE_PRIMARY_ONLY
**					LG_ERASE_DUAL_ONLY
**					LG_ERASE_BOTH
**
** Outputs:
**      sys_err                         Reason for error return status.
**	Returns:
**	    OK
**	    LG_CANTINIT		    Can't initialize the log file.
**	    LG_INITHEADER	    There are some transactions still 
**				    outstanding in the log file and the
**				    force_init was not set.
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	    none
**

**		the tran ID so that tran ID's on different nodes of the cluster
**		are always unique.
**	    Also, removed a redundant extra computation of the check sum.

**	the log file(s). Each log file has the header written twice. If only
**	one log file is currently active, its channel can be passed in either
**	channel_primary or channel_dual, depending on which log file is active.
**
**	This routine check-sums the header before writing it.
**
** Inputs:
**	header		- the header to be written, already time-stamped
**	di_io_primary	- the primary log file di_io
**	di_io_dual	- the dual log file di_io, or 0.
**	abuf		- An aligned buffer for writing from (the caller
**			  probably has one available)
**
** Outputs:
**	sys_err		- detailed info about the error, if one occurred
**
** Returns:
**	OK
**	LG_WRITEERROR	- unable to write ALL of the log file headers
**
** History:
**	Summer, 1992 (bryanp)
**	    Working on the new portable logging and locking system.
**	10-Nov-2009 (kschendel) SIR 122757
**	    Pass in aligned buffer so we don't have to make one here.
