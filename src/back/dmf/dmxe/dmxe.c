**  Name: DMXE.C - Transaction handling services.
**
**  Description:
**      This file contains the functions that manage locking and logging
**	request needed to implement transactions.
**	to begin a transaction.
**
**          dmxe_abort - Abort a transaction.
**          dmxe_begin - Begin a transaction.
**	    dmxe_commit	- Commit a transaction.
**          dmxe_savepoint - Declare a savepoint.
**	    dmxe_writebt - Write begin transaction record.
**	    dmxe_secure - Prepare to commit a transaction.
**	    dmxe_resume	- Resume a willing commit transaction.
**
**
**  History:
**      13-dec-1985 (derek)    
**          Created new for Jupiter
**	30-sep-1988 (rogerk)
**	    Added dmxe_writebt record.  Added capability to delay writing the
**	    begin transaction record in dmxe_begin until the first write
**	    operation is done.
**      30-Jan-1989 (ac)
**          Added 2PC support.
**	17-mar-1989 (EdHsu)
**	    Added cluster online backup support.
**	15-may-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Check for LG_EXCEED_LIMIT return value from LGbegin in dmxe_begin.
**	    Don't convert DMF external errors (< E_DM_INTERNAL) to generic
**	    E_DM9500_DMXE_BEGIN error number.
**	15-aug-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added support for Non-SQL Gateway.
**	11-sep-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added handling of DM0L_DMU records during rollback.
**	25-sep-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Fix PASS_ABORT bug causing us to get invalid pages in the buffer
**	    manager during rcp recovery.  Inform buffer manager when rcp is
**	    signaled to take over recovery.
**	 2-oct-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added handling of DM0L_FSWAP records during rollback.
**	16-oct-1989 (rogerk)
**	    When PASS_ABORT, toss all unused TCB's from cache in case there
**	    is a DMU operation to be aborted which requires invalidating
**	    TCB's in the cache.
**	29-dec-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added call to LGshow to dmxe_begin() to check if database is 
**	    being backed up.  If it is, then set DCB_S_BACKUP status so DMF 
**	    will know to do special logging.
**	17-jan-1990 (rogerk)
**	    Added support for delaying savepoint records for read-only
**	    transactions.  Changed arguments to dmxe_writebt routine.
**	    Moved LGend call out of error handling in dm0l_bt.  The caller
**	    of dm0l_bt is now responsible for cleaning up the transaction.
**	06-apr-1990 (fred)
**	    Added support for SCS_SET_ACTIVITY'ing progress of abort.  This is
**	    used so that users can diagnose HUNG servers as being busy doing an
**	    abort.
**	 4-feb-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Added new argument to dm0p_toss_pages call.
**	 4-feb-1990 (rogerk)
**	    Added support for NOLOGGING in dmxe_writebt.  Don't write 
**	    log records in an XCB_NOLOGGING transaction.
**	25-feb-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Added DM0L_TEST log record type.  It is ignored in UNDO.
**	    Added as part of Archiver Stability project.
**	22-mar-1991 (bryanp)
**	    Fix B36630: created dm2d_check_db_backup_status() and
**	    dm2r_set_rcb_btbi_info() and added calls to them in dmxe_begin and
**	    dmxe_writebt().
**	25-mar-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Changed abort handling of Set Nologging transactions.  These
**	    will now raise an error which will cause us to mark the database
**	    inconsistent.
**	 6-may-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Fix two settings of err_code to use "=" instead of "==".  These
**	    were in the abort code when database inconsistent was encountered.
**	    This was causing us to not propogate the DB_INCONSISTENT state back
**	    to the caller correctly.
**	6-jun-1991 (rachael,bryanp)
**	    Added error e_dm9c07_out_of_locklists for error message project.
**	    This error will print in the errlog.log prior to the return of
**	    e_dm004b.
**	16-jul-1991 (bryanp)
**	    B38527: add support for DM0L_OLD_MODIFY & DM0L_OLD_INDEX &
**	    DM0L_SM0_CLOSEPURGE. The new SM0_CLOSEPURGE record is not currently
**	    used during UNDO processing, but I'm passing it to the DMVE layer
**	    anyway so as to be consistent with the other sysmod records, which
**	    ARE used by UNDO.
**	19-aug-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Added dmxe_check_abort routine to return the abort status of
**	    a transaction.  This was added as part of a bugfix for B39017.
**	    It allows the buffer manager to check the transaction state
**	    to avoid lock escalation while in abort processing.
**	17-oct-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Great Merge of DMF : Move 6.4 changes into 6.5.  In this case,
**	    the 6.4 version of this file was moved directly to 6.5 and the
**	    6.5 changes were merged back in:
**
**	     9-oct-1989 (Derek)
**		B1 changes: add CRDB log record.
**	    14-jun-1991 (Derek)
**		File extend project:
**		Add new file extend log record types : assoc, alloc, dealloc,
**		and extend.  Remove obsolete balloc, calloc, bpextend, and
**		bdealloc records.
**		Added new performance profiling hooks.
**		Added new on-line checkpoint protocol to reduce number of BI's
**		that need to be saved.
**		Added call to dm0p_wpass_abort to flush pages required
**		for pass-abort handling.
**      15-oct-1991 (mikem)
**          Eliminated unix compile warnings in dmxe_abort().
**	 3-nov-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Added DM0LOVFL log record to dmxe_abort, no action is taken 
**	    during UNDO.
**	21-jan-1992 (jnash)
**	    Add SES_30 tracepoint to generate pass abort within dmxe_abort.
**	14-may-1992 (bryanp)
**	    B38112: Write DM0L_DBINCONST record if DB is already inconsistent.
**	8-jul-1992 (walt)
**	    Prototyping DMF.
**      25-sep-1992 (nandak)
**          Copy the entire distributed transaction id.
**	26-oct-1992 (rogerk)
**	    Reduced Logging Project:  Added support for new recovery protocols:
**	      - Changed abort processing to follow new rollback protocols:
**		- Removed Before Image recovery.
**		- Added new log record types.
**		- Added support for CLR log records.
**		- Removed force/toss of pages during abort processing.
**	      - Added new dmxe_pass_abort routine to handle pass aborts.
**	      - Removed calls to dm0p_tran_invalidate.
**	      - Added clstatus error reporting to several routines.
**	14-dec-1992 (rogerk)
**	    Include dm1b.h before dm0l.h for prototype definitions.
**	08-feb-1993 (jnash)
**	    Pass journal status to dm0l_savepoint.  Cast ME calls to
**	    quiet compiler.  
**	10-feb-1993 (jnash)
**	    Add FALSE param to dmd_log().
**	30-feb-1993 (rmuth)
**	    Include di.h for dm0c.h
**	15-mar-1993 (rogerk & jnash)
**	    Reduced Logging - Phase IV:
**	    Renamed prev_lsn to compensated_lsn.
**	    Changed Abortsave and EndMini log records to written as CLR's.
**	        The compensated_lsn field is now used to skip backwards in
**		in the log file rather than using the log addresses in the
**		log records themselves.
**	    Removed dmxe_abort output parameter to return the Log Address of
**		the abortsave log record.
**	    Added dmve_logging field which indicates to write CLR's during
**		undo recovery.
**	    Also cast a couple of MEcopy() params to (char *) to quiet compiler.
**	    Changed LG_S_DBID show call in dmxe_resume.
**	    Removed obsolete rcb_bt_bi_logging and rcb_merge_logging fields.
**	    Deleted dm2r_set_rcb_btbi_info routine.
**      26-apr-1993 (bryanp)
**          6.5 Cluster support:
**              Replace all uses of DM_LOG_ADDR with LG_LA or LG_LSN.
**		Pass correct transaction handle to dm0l_read.
**		Not all callers of dmxe_abort have an ODCB available. For
**		    example, the checkpoint process does not have an ODCB. I
**		    changed dmxe_abort to take both an ODCB AND a DCB parameter,
**		    and fixed the callers such that those that have an ODCB,
**		    pass the ODCB; those that have a DCB, pass the DCB, and
**		    dmxe_abort figures out the mess.
**	24-may-1993 (bryanp)
**	    Include <pc.h> before <lk.h> to pick up PID definition.
**	24-may-1993 (andys)
**	    Pass appropriate logfile blocksize to dmd_log and dmd_format_log
**	    rather than using hardwired 4096.
**	21-jun-1993 (bryanp)
**	    Add handling of LKrelease(LK_ALL) errors as a special case.
**	    Improve error message logging when dmxe_pass_abort fails.
**	14-jul-93 (ed)
**	    replacing <dbms.h> by <gl.h> <sl.h> <iicommon.h> <dbdbms.h>
**	26-jul-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Include respective CL headers for all cl calls.
**	23-aug-1993 (jnash)
**	    Don't journal savepoints.  Rollfoward figures out what to do 
**	    from LSN context.
**      10-sep-1993 (pearl)
**          In dmxe_abort(), add error DM0152_DB_INCONSIST_DETAIL if database
**          is inconsistent; this error will name the database in question.
**	20-sep-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Initialize dmve_rolldb_action list when dmve cb is initialized.
**	18-oct-1993 (rachael) Bug 52925
**	    An abort attempt in a set nologging transaction causes the database
**	    to be marked inconsistent.  The configuration file is opened and the
**	    inconsistency is recorded, but the logging system is not informed
**	    as is done when logging is being performed.  This means that
**	    other sessions will not be notified of the inconsistency when they
**	    write to the logging system.  The fix is to mark the LDB invalid
**	    for the database when the inconsistency is recorded in the
**	    configuration file.
**	18-oct-1993 (jnash)
**	    Issue error when pass abort performed.
**	18-oct-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Change inconsistent db error messages to not reference odcb as it
**	    may not be defined in this routine.
**	18-oct-93 (rogerk)
**	    Changed LG_A_OWNER interface in dmxe_resume so that it expects the 
**	    db_id of the caller's open database context.  We no longer scavange
**	    the opendb from the orphaned transaction, only the xact itself.
**      22-nov-96 (stial01,dilma04)
**          Row Locking Project:
**          Added dmxe_xn_active()
**	27-Feb-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Extended <set transaction statement> to support <transaction access mode>
**	    (READ ONLY | READ WRITE) per SQL-92.
**	    Removed call to dm0l_robt() which really isn't needed and just make
**	    the LGbegin() call here with the proper flags.
**      21-may-1997 (stial01)
**          Disallow PASS-ABORT for row locking transaction.
** 	17-jun-1997 (wonst02)
** 	    Changes for readonly database.
**      22-Aug-1997 (wonst02)
**          Added parentheses-- '==' has higher precedence than bitwise '&':
**	    (flag & DMXE_NOLOGGING) && ((flag & DMXE_ROTRAN) == 0)), not:
**	    (flag & DMXE_NOLOGGING) && (flag & DMXE_ROTRAN == 0))
**	25-Aug-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Added log_id parm to dm0p_toss_pages(), dm0p_wpass_abort(),
**	    dm2t_reclaim_tcb() calls.
**	    Acquire the lctx_mutex after doing the log force for the transaction,
**	    instead of before it, to permit concurrent log forces.
**	11-Nov-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Pass DM0L_DELAYBT to dm0l_bt() when writing a delayed BT.
**      08-Dec-1997 (hanch04)
**          Use new la_block field when block number is needed instead
**          of calculating it from the offset
**          Keep track of block number and offset into the current block.
**          for support of logs > 2 gig
**      31-Aug-1998 (wanya01)
**          Fix bug 77435: IPM session detail display shows "Performing Force
**          Abort Processing" as activity for session which is executing a
**          normal rollback.  Take out change 415103 which fix bug 62550.
**          Change 415103 wrongly set session activity to be "performing 
**          force abort processing" without checking the cause of abort.
**      22-Feb-1999 (bonro01)
**          Replace references to svcb_log_id with
**          dmf_svcb->svcb_lctx_ptr->lctx_lgid
**	15-Mar-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Removed DM0L_DELAYBT references.
**      05-may-1999 (nanpr01,stial01)
**          dmxe_xn_active() Set err_code if LGshow fails
**	08-Sep-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    LKshow(LK_S_LLB_INFO) changed to LK_S_LIST. LK_S_LLB_INFO
**	    only returns info of lock list's related list, if any, causing
**	    erroneous E_DM93F5_ROW_LOCK_PROTOCOL errors because LK_LLB_INFO
**	    is garbage!
**	30-Nov-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Added DB_DIS_TRAN_ID* to dmxe_begin(), LKcreate_list() prototypes.
**	15-Dec-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Added DB_DIS_TRAN_ID parm to LGbegin() prototype.
**	    Removed DB_DIS_TRAN_ID parm from LKcreate_list() prototype.
**	    Added support for SHARED transactions.
**      18-jan-2000 (gupsh01)
**          Added support for setting transaction flag when the transaction
**          changed a non-journaled table for a journaled database.
**	14-Mar-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Removed writing of SAVEPOINT and BMINI log records. 
**	03-Aug-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Modified dmxe_abort() to support concurrent rollback for
**	    DAR 6075960.
**	24-Aug-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    When aborting a SHARED transaction in WILLING_COMMIT state,
**	    call (new) LKalter(LK_A_REASSOC) to prepare the SHARED
**	    locklist for the RCP.
**      01-feb-2001 (stial01)

**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	29-Mar-2001 (jenjo02)
**	    Added TRdisplay's of begin and end of rollback to assure
**	    QA that concurrent rollback occurs.
**	30-Apr-2001 (jenjo02)
**	    Reduce log clutter; only do those TRdisplays when trace
**	    point DM903 is set.
**	30-may-2001 (devjo01)
**	    Add cx.h for CXcluster_enabled(). s103715.

/*{
** Name: dmxe_abort	- Abort transaction
**
** Description:
**      This routine implements the abort to savepoint or abort to
**	transaction primitives.
**
**	Some callers of this routine happen to have an ODCB control block
**	available. If available, the ODCB is the preferred control block to
**	pass to this routine, as it contains information about session context.
**
**	If this routine must be called outside of normal session context (for
**	example by the DMFCPP process), then the ODCB may not be available. In
**	this case, callers may pass the DCB control block. dmxe_abort will
**	attempt to figure out which is which and what is what, and will use the
**	information from whatever control block is available, WITH ONE
**	EXCEPTION:
**
**	    If dmxe_abort is being called outside of session context (i.e., when
**	    only the DCB is available), then gateway session aborting will not
**	    be performed. This is because gateway session aborting requires a
**	    session context.
**
**	I believe that in all cases where dmxe_abort is called with only the DCB
**	available, gateway session aborting is not actually required, since no
**	gateway updates were performed, so this should not cause any problems.
**
**
**	What happens when a transaction abort fails?
**	============================================
**
**	In most cases, if the transaction abort fails, we attempt a pass-abort.
**	Pass-abort is a prototocl in which the transaction is passed to the RCP
**	and the RCP makes another attempt to abort the transaction. After we
**	pass the transaction to the RCP, we return to our caller as though we
**	succeeded in aborting the transaction. Meanwhile, the RCP picks up the
**	transaction and tries again to abort it. Note that during the time that
**	the RCP is making this attempt, our caller may believe that the
**	transaction has already disappeared, while the logging and locking
**	system still know that this transaction exists, and that sometimes
**	leads to peculiar results.
**
**	There is one particular error condition which does NOT lead to a pass
**	abort. At the end of transaction abort processing, after we have logged
**	the DM0L_ET(ABORT) record, and after we have successfully released the
**	transaction context from the logging system, we then call the locking
**	system with LKrelease(LK_ALL) to release the transaction's lock list and
**	all of its locks. If this call should fail, we are in a quandary: we
**	cannot pass-abort the transaction, because the transaction is gone. If
**	we try to pass-abort the transaction, the logging system will complain.
**	However, we have this lock list out there which is holding some locks
**	which cannot be released. Since transaction lock list cleanup is only
**	performed as a result of completing the processing of the associated
**	transaction, it does no good to kill this server either, since server
**	failure recovery will still not clean up the lock list. In effect, we
**	have a "lock leak": this stranded lock list will remain in the locking
**	system until the system is shut down and restarted. We deal with this
**	failure by logging the locking system errors to the error log, but then
**	we simply return OK to our caller, and decide to proceed on about our
**	business. If the stranded locks cause concurrency problems, eventually
**	the user will end up having to shutdown and restart the entire
**	installation, but until then we may as well continue processing.

**
** History:
**      21-jul-1986 (Derek)
**	    Created for Jupiter.
**      30-Jan-1989 (ac)
**          Added 2PC support.
**	15-aug-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added support for Non-SQL Gateway.  If server is connected to a
**	    gateway which requires begin/end transaction notification, then
**	    we must notify the gateway of the abort.
**	11-sep-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added handling of DM0L_DMU records during rollback.
**	25-sep-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Fix PASS_ABORT bug causing us to get invalid pages in the buffer
**	    manager during rcp recovery.  Inform buffer manager when rcp is
**	    signaled to take over recovery.  Also need to toss all non-locked
**	    pages in the buffer manager before signaling rcp recovery.  Any
**	    page belonging to the same database may be invalidated by the RCP.
**	    Check that sp_id was passed into dmxe_abort before breaking when
**	    find a savepoint id that matches it.
**	 2-oct-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added handling of DM0L_FSWAP records during rollback.
**	16-oct-1989 (rogerk)
**	    When PASS_ABORT, toss all unused TCB's from cache in case there
**	    is a DMU operation to be aborted which requires invalidating
**	    TCB's in the cache.
**	25-feb-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Added DM0L_TEST log record type.  It is ignored in UNDO.
**	    Added as part of Archiver Stability project.
**	25-mar-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Changed abort handling of Set Nologging transactions.  These
**	    will now raise an error which will cause us to mark the database
**	    inconsistent.
**	 6-may-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Fix two settings of err_code to use "=" instead of "==".  This
**	    was causing us to not propogate the DB_INCONSISTENT state back
**	    to the caller correctly.
**	16-jul-1991 (bryanp)
**	    B38527: add support for DM0L_OLD_MODIFY & DM0L_OLD_INDEX &
**	    DM0L_SM0_CLOSEPURGE. The new SM0_CLOSEPURGE record is not currently
**	    used during UNDO processing, but I'm passing it to the DMVE layer
**	    anyway so as to be consistent with the other sysmod records, which
**	    ARE used by UNDO.
**	19-aug-1991 (rogerk)
**	    As long as I was touching this file, I tried to modify the while
**	    loop in the cleanup of abort processing which rendered "warning:
**	    statement not reached" errors on unix.
**	17-oct-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Great Merge of DMF : Move 6.4 changes into 6.5.  In this case,
**	    the 6.4 version of this file was moved directly to 6.5 and the
**	    6.5 changes were merged back in:
**
**	     9-oct-1989 (Derek)
**		B1 changes: add CRDB log record.
**	    14-jun-1991 (Derek)
**		File extend project:
**		Add new file extend log record types : assoc, alloc, dealloc,
**		and extend.  Remove obsolete balloc, calloc, bpextend, and
**		bdealloc records.
**		Added new performance profiling hooks.
**		Added new on-line checkpoint protocol to reduce number of BI's
**		that need to be saved.
**		Added call to dm0p_wpass_abort to flush pages required
**		for pass-abort handling.
**      15-oct-1991 (mikem)
**          Eliminated unix compile warnings ("warning: statement not reached")
**          by changing the way "while (E_DB_OK)" loops were coded.
**	 3-nov-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Added DM0LOVFL log record - no action is taken during UNDO.
**      21-jan-1992 (jnash)
**          Add SES_30 tracepoint to generate pass abort.
**	14-may-1992 (bryanp)
**	    B38112: Write DM0L_DBINCONST record if DB is already inconsistent.
**	26-oct-1992 (rogerk)
**	    Reduced Logging Project:  Added support for new recovery protocols:
**	      - Removed Before Image recovery.
**	      - Added support for CLR log records.  When a CLR is encountered,
**		we skip over already completed undo work back to the CLR's
**		prev_lsn address.
**	      - Took out FORCE argument to dm0p_force_pages called at the
**		end of the abort operation.  Abort updates are now cached
**		according to normal Fast Commit protocols.
**	      - Bypass dm0p_force_pages call if the abort is only to a svpt.
**	      - Took out call to dm0p_tran_invalidate made before starting
**		abort processing.  Pages can no longer be tossed before an
**		abort since BI recovery is not used.
**	      - Added error message indicating when a Pass Abort is signaled.
**	      - Moved Force Abort handling to new dmxe_pass_abort routine.
**		We now log force abort actions.  We now call dm0p_force_pages
**		instead of dm0p_tran_invalidate to release the pages needed
**		for the pass abort.
**	      - Moved switch statement with undo calls to dmve_undo routine.
**	      - Remove fswap processing.
**	      - Add new log record types: AI, BTDEL, BTPUT, BTSPLIT, BTOVFL,
**		BTFREE, BTUPDOVFL, DISASSOC, CRVERIFY, NOFULL, FMAP.
**	15-mar-1993 (jnash & rogerk)
**	    Reduced Logging - Phase IV:
**	    Renamed prev_lsn to compensated_lsn.
**	    Changed Abortsave and EndMini log records to written as CLR's.
**	        The compensated_lsn field is now used to skip backwards in
**		in the log file rather than using the log addresses in the
**		log records themselves.
**	    Added logic to allow multiple AbortSave log records to point
**		back to a common Savepoint.
**	    Removed output parameter to return the Log Address of the
**		abortsave log record.
**	    Added dmve_logging field which indicates to write CLR's during
**		undo recovery.
**	    Changed log record format: added database_id, tran_id and LSN
**		in the log record header.  The LSN of a log record is now
**		obtained from the record itself rather than from the dmve
**		control block.
**      26-apr-1993 (bryanp)
**          6.5 Cluster support:
**              Replace all uses of DM_LOG_ADDR with LG_LA or LG_LSN.
**		Pass correct transaction handle to dm0l_read.
**		Not all callers of dmxe_abort have an ODCB available. For
**		    example, the checkpoint process does not have an ODCB. I
**		    changed dmxe_abort to take both an ODCB AND a DCB parameter,
**		    and fixed the callers such that those that have an ODCB,
**		    pass the ODCB; those that have a DCB, pass the DCB, and
**		    dmxe_abort figures out the mess.
**	24-may-1993 (andys)
**	    Pass appropriate logfile blocksize to dmd_log and dmd_format_log
**	    rather than using hardwired 4096.
**	21-jun-1993 (bryanp)
**	    Add handling of LKrelease(LK_ALL) errors as a special case.
**	    Improve error message logging when dmxe_pass_abort fails.
**      10-sep-1993 (pearl)
**          In dmxe_abort(), add error DM0152_DB_INCONSIST_DETAIL if database
**          is inconsistent; this error will name the database in question.
**	20-sep-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Initialize dmve_rolldb_action list field.
**	18-oct-1993 (rachael) Bug 52925
**	    An abort attempt in a set nologging transaction causes the database
**	    to be marked inconsistent.  The configuration file is opened and the
**	    inconsistency is recorded, but the logging system is not informed
**	    as is done when logging is being performed.  This means that
**	    other sessions will not be notified of the inconsistency when they
**	    write to the logging system.  The fix is to mark the LDB invalid
**	    for the database when the inconsistency is recorded in the
**	    configuration file.
**	18-oct-1993 (jnash)
**	    Issue error when pass abort performed.
**	18-oct-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Change inconsistent db error messages to not reference odcb as it
**	    may not be defined in this routine.
**	06-Nov-1994 (Bin Li)
**	    Fix bug 62550 regarding the inconsistency between exp.scf.scs.scb
**	    _activity and exp.scf.scs.scb_act_detail if encountering force_abort
**	    while running the query without commiting. Update the activity 
**	    within the following function call if force_abort is encountered 
**	    in order for two activities in sync.
**	01-aug-1996 (nanpr01)
**	    Clearout the "performing Force Abort Message " by setting
**	    the scf_blength to zero.
** 	17-jun-1997 (wonst02)
** 	    Changes for readonly database.
**	25-Aug-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Acquire the lctx_mutex after doing the log force for the transaction,
**	    instead of before it, to permit concurrent log forces.
**	15-Dec-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Support for SHARED transactions.
**	    Perform rollback only when this is the last (only)
**	    connection to the (shared) transaction.
**	    Test on the state of the SHARED transaction rather than this
**	    local one.
**      18-jan-2000 (gupsh01)
**          Added support for setting transaction flag when the transaction
**          changed a non-journaled table for a journaled database.
**	14-Mar-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    SAVEPOINT and BMINI log records no longer written. They are only
**	    needed for online recovery and we can do that just fine 
**	    without them.
**	03-Aug-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Modified dmxe_abort() to support concurrent rollback for
**	    DAR 6075960.
**	24-Aug-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    When aborting a SHARED transaction in WILLING_COMMIT state,
**	    call (new) LKalter(LK_A_REASSOC) to prepare the SHARED
**	    locklist for the RCP.
**	29-Mar-2001 (jenjo02)
**	    Added TRdisplay's of begin and end of rollback to assure
**	    QA that concurrent rollback occurs.
**	30-Apr-2001 (jenjo02)
**	    Reduce log clutter; only do those TRdisplays when trace
**	    point DM903 is set.
**      22-oct-2002 (stial01)
**          Added dmxe_xa_abort
**	17-Apr-2003 (jenjo02)
**	    When checking NOLOGGING transaction, check DMXE_ROTRAN
**	    in addition to tr_status & TR_ACTIVE. STAR 12602247,
**	    INGSRV2225, BUG 110097.
**	5-Apr-2004 (schka24)
**	    Clear out new rawdata pointers in dmve.
**	30-aug-2004 (thaju02)
**	    Initialize dmve_flags.
**  12-Jan-2005 (fanra01)
**      lgr_sequence, used in the abort progress message, is defined in
**      LG_RECORD as an i2 but the intent is to utilize the full 32-bit
**      range.  Cast value to a u_i2 during conversion for display.
**	15-Aug-2005 (jenjo02)
**	    Implement multiple DMF LongTerm memory pools and
**	    ShortTerm session memory.
**	15-Mar-2006 (jenjo02)
**	    dm0l_force the log only through the transaction's last LSN,
**	    not the entire log.
**	11-Sep-2006 (jonj)
**	    Override the supplied tran_id with the one known to the
**	    logging system. In LOGFULL_COMMIT situations, it may
**	    be different than the one known externally.
**	19-Jan-2007 (kschendel)
**	    Always make the lock list noninterruptable, even for abort
**	    to savepoint.  (See inline for why.)
**	23-Feb-2007 (kschendel) b122040
**	    "ack" any pending interrupt when we start aborting.  This isn't
**	    a real answer to the row-lock pass abort thing, but it should
**	    help some;  if we're here, we don't need to be interrupted
**	    again.
**	8-Aug-2007 (kibro01) b118915
**	    Add in flag to allow lock release to take place after the
**	    commit, so that transaction temporary tables can keep their
**	    lock until they are destroyed.
**	15-Jan-2010 (jonj)
**	    SIR 121619 MVCC: If rollback to savepoint and the last
**	    LSN written by the transaction is the savepoint LSN,
**	    then do nothing.
**	04-Feb-2010 (jonj)
**	    SIR 121619 MVCC: Add bufid parameter to dm0l_read().
**	23-Sep-2010 (jonj) B124486
**	    If PASS_ABORT and DMXE_DELAY_UNLOCK, return E_DB_ERROR
**	    with E_DM9509_DMXE_PASS_ABORT to keep dmx_abort from
**	    releasing the lock list - the RCP needs it to
**	    recover the transaction.

**					DMXE_READ, DMXE_WRITE.
**      flags                           From the following:
**					DMXE_INTERNAL - local transaction
**					DMXE_JOURNAL - tran is journaled
**					DMXE_DELAYBT - don't write begin
**					    transaction record. It will be
**					    written when the first write
**					    operation is performed.
**					DMXE_CONNECT - connect to
**					    existing log/lock contexts.
**					DMXE_XA_START_XA - explicit 
**					    start XA transaction.
**					DMXE_XA_START_JOIN - explicit join
**					    to an existing XA transaction,
**					    combined with DMXE_XA_START_XA
**	dcb				dcb pointer.
**	dcb_id				The logging system database id.
**	user_name			The user name of the session.
**	related_lock			The related lock list.
**      tran_id                         Optional distributed transaction id.
**
** Outputs:
**      tran_id                         The assigned transaction_id.

** Side Effects:
**
**
** History:
**	13-dec-1985 (derek)
**          Created new for jupiter.
**      09-jun-1986 (ac)    
**          Added dm0l_bt() and dm0l_robt() logging calls.
**      18-Aug-1987 (ac)
**	    Changed to LGbegin a transaction, create the lock list, then
**	    write the begin transaction log record.
**      30-sep-1987 (rogerk)
**	    Added flags parameter to take place of old type and journal parms.
**	    Added DELAYBT flag which specifies to not write a begin transaction
**	    log record.  The BT record will be written when (if) the first
**	    write operation is performed.
**      12-Jan-1989 (ac)
**          Added 2PC support.
**	17-mar-1989 (EdHsu)
**	    Support cluster online backup.
**	15-may-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Check for LG_EXCEED_LIMIT return value from LGbegin.
**	    Don't convert DMF external errors (< E_DM_INTERNAL) to generic
**	    E_DM9500_DMXE_BEGIN error number.
**	29-dec-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added call to LGshow to check if database is being backed up.  If
**	    it is, then set DCB_S_BACKUP status so DMF will know to do special
**	    logging.
**	17-jan-1990 (rogerk)
**	    Moved LGend call out of dm0l_bt when there is an error.  We need
**	    to call LGend here now if dm0l_bt returns an error.
**	22-mar-1991 (bryanp)
**	    B36630: move dcb_status handling into dm2d_check_db_backup_status().
**	6-jun-1991 (rachael,bryanp)
**	    Added error e_dm9c07_out_of_locklists for error message project.
**	    This error will print in the errlog.log prior to the return of
**	    e_dm004b.
**	26-oct-1992 (rogerk)
**	    Added clstatus error reporting.
**	27-Feb-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Extended <set transaction statement> to support <transaction access mode>
**	    (READ ONLY | READ WRITE) per SQL-92.
**	    Removed call to dm0l_robt() which really isn't needed and just make
**	    the LGbegin() call here with the proper flags.
**	15-Dec-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Support for SHARED transactions. If connecting to a SHARED log 
**	    transaction, create a SHARED lock list.
**	29-Jan-2004 (jenjo02)
**	    Added support for DMXE_CONNECT to connect to existing
**	    log/lock contexts.
**	29-Jun-2006 (jonj)
**	    Add support for DMXE_XA_START_XA, DMXE_XA_START_JOIN
**	28-Jul-2006 (jonj)
**	    Don't ule_format duplicate/unknown txn Log errors
**	    if XA, those are simple user errors.
**	01-Aug-2006 (jonj)
**	    Handle LG_CONTINUE status from LGbegin for XA transactions.

**	13-dec-1985 (derek)
**          Created new for jupiter.
**      09-jun-1986 (ac)
**          Added dm0l_et() logging call.
**      26-feb-87 (jennifer)
**          Added commit time to call.
**	08-apr-1987 (Derek)
**	    Must call dm0p_force_pages on a read-only transaction so that
**	    the cache locks held by the buffer manager can be released.
**	15-jun-87 (rogerk)
**	    Added parameter to dm0p_force_pages for fast commit. Took out
**	    call to dm0l_force as it is not needed.
**      30-Jan-1989 (ac)
**          Added 2PC support.
**	26-oct-1992 (rogerk)
**	    Added clstatus error reporting.
**      18-jan-2000 (gupsh01)
**          Added support for setting transaction flag when the transaction
**          changed a non-journaled table for a journalaed database.
**	20-Apr-2004 (jenjo02)
**	    Added support for LOGFULL_COMMIT.
**	30-Apr-2004 (schka24)
**	    Don't force pages or write ET if disconnecting shared txn.
**	03-May-2004 (jenjo02)
**	    Slight modification to Karl's last change; go ahead and
**	    call dm0l_et even for SHARED (DMXE_COMMIT) txns, LG now
**	    delays the ET until the last sharer commits.
**	22-Jul-2004 (schka24)
**	    Avoid the confusing "unlock:all" from a lock-traced session
**	    that has merely disconnected from a shared txn instead of
**	    actually committing it.
**	29-Sep-2006 (jonj)
**	    Remove bogus cast from tran_id to XCB*, trust the 
**	    BT-journaledness provided by the caller.
**	28-Jun-2007 (kibro01) b118559
**	    Add in flag to allow lock release to take place after the
**	    commit, so that transaction temporary tables can keep their
**	    lock until they are destroyed.

**	    fields to inact this change.
**	 4-feb-1990 (rogerk)
**	    Added support for NOLOGGING.  Don't write log records in
**	    an XCB_NOLOGGING transaction.
**	22-mar-1991 (bryanp)
**	    Fix B36630: When this transaction writes its BT record, it may need

**	    Reduced Logging - Phase IV:

**	    Added clstatus error reporting.
**      1-Oct-1997 (thaju02) bug#72386 - While there is another session
**          connected to database, aborting a two phase commit transaction
**          via lartool, results in the transaction being committed
**          instead of being aborted. dmfrcp undo's log records and writes
**          changes to disk on behalf of lartool. While there is
**          another session to database, reading stale pages in dmf cache
**          buffer, buffer is written out to disk, ultimately overwriting
**          the 'good' rolled back pages. Calling dm0p_force_pages with
**          action of 0, resulted in buffer being written to disk, yet
**          being left in the cache. Modified dm0p_force_pages() to
**          have action of DM0P_TOSS.
**	30-Apr-2002 (jenjo02)
**	    Moved dm0p_force_pages() from here to dm0l_secure().
**	    Must wait to force transaction's pages until all
**	    HANDLE transactions have prepared and the global
**	    transaction is ready to be put in WILLING COMMIT
**	    to avoid DM9C01 page-still-fixed failures.
