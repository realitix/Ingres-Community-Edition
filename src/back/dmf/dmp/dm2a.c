**
**  Name: DM2A.C - Aggregate Request Processor.
**
**  Description:
**      This file contains the routines that process those simple
**	aggregate functions that are best done by one call to DMF
**	rather than multiple calls to DMF from QEF. Prior to the addition
**	of this DMF-based Aggregate Request Processor, all aggregates were
**	processed within QEF, with QEF getting one record at a time from
**	DMF in order to perform some aggregation logic, which, in the most
**	degenerate cases would simply add 1 to a (very expensive ADE) counter
**	to process a COUNT agg, or scan/compare every record of a btree table,
**	just to find the minimum or maximum value of the key field.
**
**	This Aggregate Request Processor removes these performance problems
**	by applying knowledge of individual storage structures to satisfy the
**	requested aggregates. DMR_AGGREGATE may be used to compute COUNT, MIN,
**	MAX, SUM and AVG aggregates, in any combination, and against any 
**	storage structure. Even when used in the 'worst case', eg all 
**	aggregates against a heap table, use of DMR_AGGREGATE reduces CPU 
**	and system paging, as QEF only invokes DMF once, rather than once 
**	for each qualifying tuple.
**
**	The addition of this Aggregate Request Processor was done in 
**	conjunction with changes to QEF, to invoke this processor, and with
**	OPF, to detect certain special cases (limited aggregates) described
**	below. The Aggregate Request Processor is invoked via the
**	DMR_AGGREGATE request type to dmfcall(), and processes multiple
**	aggregates in one pass, with the result(s) available to QEF upon
**	return from a single DMR_AGGREGATE request. With the exception
**	of a simple COUNT aggregate, the DMF Aggregate Request Processor will
**	invoke ADE to 'compute' the aggregate results, using an ADE_EXCB
**	provided by QEF upon issuing the DMR_AGGREGATE request. Qualifications
**	are handled as usual in DMF, if the dmr_q_fcn is provided with the
**	DMR_AGGREGATE request.  
**
**	Prior to issueing a DMR_AGGREGATE request, QEF must execute
**	a DMR_POSITION request, as in the past, using the DMR_CB that is
**	subsequently passed in with the DMR_AGGREGATE request.
**	
**	If the table is a gateway, no optimizations are done, and each
**	record (as per positioning) is read and aggregated, as before.
**
**	AGGREGATE LIMIT INDICATORS
**	--------------------------
**	As an optimization, DMR_AGGREGATE may be passed  bits referred
**	to as 'aggregate limit indicators', which indicate that the request 
**	conforms to certain limits that  allow extensive optimizations within
**	DMF. These bits and the optimizations performed are listed below. 
**	In general the absence of any aggregate limit indicators means
**	that any combination of aggregates may be present in the  ADE_EXCB, and
**	that DMF must call ade_execute_cx() for each tuple that passes the  
**	DMR_POSITION and optional qualification function criteria. The presence
**	of 1 or more aggregate limit indicators means that ONLY the aggregates
**	indicated are present in the ADE_EXCB and that DMF may optimize
**	the data path, as described below.
** 
**	The aggregate limit indicators, DMR_AGLIM_COUNT, DMR_AGLIM_MIN and
**	DMR_AGLIM_MAX indicate that a combination of COUNT, MIN or MAX
**	aggregates are present, in conformance with the following
**	restrictions, presumably enforced by OPF:
**
**	1. No other aggregates, other than those indicated by the
**	   combination of bits supplied, are being executed.
**
**	2. In the case of MIN and MAX, the aggregation is being done
**	   on the (major field of the) key of a BTREE or ISAM table.
**	   (DMR_AGGREGATE may be used for a non-keyed MIN/MAX, however
**	    the limit bits may not be used, and a full, albeit efficient
**	    scan will be done).
**
**
** CATEGORIES OF AGGREGATES & LIMIT BITS
**
**	For the purposes of the effects of the DMR_AGGREGATE request,
**	the possible combinations of different aggregates and the optimizations
**	performed are listed below, in decreasing order of potential 
**	optimization.  The term 'Qual' indicates either the existence of a 
**	qualification OR the presence of C2 security in the system, either
**	of which require additional work to be done for a COUNT request - 
**	namely the actual referencing and evaluation of tuples 
**	whose presence would otherwise be accounted for based on other 
**	structural information in the table.
**	Each 'DMF ACTIVITY' listed below corresponds to an 'action block'
**	of type DM2A_AGGACT that is used in the code to represent the
**	steps needed and their context of execution.
**
**	The numbers in parens are referred to in the code, such as CASE(1).
**
**	AGGREGATE
**	FUNCTION(S)	DMF ACTIVITY/OPTIMIZATION		'LIMIT' BIT	
**	----------	----------------------------------	-----------
**	(1)
**	COUNT alone	Varies by storage structure. 		DMR_AGLIM_COUNT
**	Without Qual    BTREE - only read leaf pages, add
**			up all bt_kids. Other structs - read
**			data pages, add up # tups based on
**			linetab accessor. 
**	            	Tuples themselves not accessed.
**			ade_execute_cx() never called. 
**	
**	(2)
**	MIN and/or MAX	Varies by storage structure. BTREE	DMR_AGLIM_MIN
**	without		or ISAM full or qualified scan is 	    and/or
**	any others.	reduced, to start/end probes, using	DMR_AGLIM_MAX
**	w/wo Qual.	knowledge of index structure.			
**			All qualifying records from reduced 
**			scan are be passed to ade_execute_cx().
**			There is a separate DM2A_AGGACT action
**			block, and a separate scan, for each
**			of MIN and MAX if both present.
**
**			BTREE/min - read till 1st qualifying
**			tuple, must be min since data is sorted.
**
**			BTREE/max - Read backwards from end of
**			qual, if any, or position to EOT and
**			read backwards. Stop at 1st qualifying
**			tuple since data is sorted.
**
**			ISAM/min - read mainpgs and ovflo pages
**			via dm2r_get until at least one qualifying
**			tuple has been found, AND until the end of
**			the entire mainpg/ovflo chain in which the
**			qualifying tuple has been found. This ensures
**			that any key with a lower value that is in
**			that mainpg range but is out of sort will
**			still be evaluated by ade_execute_cx().
**
**			ISAM/max - Start reading the last mainpg of
**			the positioned scan, and its overflows, until
**			the entire chain is scanned. If a qualifying
**			tup is found, thats it. Else, locate the 
**			previous mainpg (by brute force) and scan its 
**			entire chain continuing as above until reaching
**			the beginning of the positioned scan.
**	
**	(3)
**	MIN/MAX		Varies by storage structure.           	DMR_AGLIM_COUNT
**	with COUNT.	BTREE - Execute the    	   	    	    and
**	Without Qual.	union of (1) and (2) listed above,	DMR_AGLIM_MIN
**			ie. start/end probes for MIN/MAX,	OR DMR_AGLIM_MAX
**			followed by one pass over leaf pages 
**			to calculate COUNT.
**			For other structures, since data pages
**			must be read, treat like CASE(6)
**	
**	
**	(4)
**	COUNT		                               		DMR_AGLIM_COUNT
**	With Qual	All records within scan are accessed, 
**			qualified and counted.
**			No call to ade_execute_cx() for result.   
**			 
**	(5)
**	MIN/MAX		Like COUNT With QUAL(4), except that    DMR_AGLIM_COUNT
**	with COUNT.	ade_execute_cx() is called for each  	    and
**	With Qual.	qualifying tuple to compute result.     DMR_AGLIM_MIN
**								or DMR_AGLIM_MAX
**	
**	(6)
**	SUM, AVG	DMF need only be called once. All 	    none
**	with/without 	qualifying tups within scan range 
**	any others, 	must be passed to ade_execute_cx().

/*{
** Name: dm2a_simpagg - Process simple aggregate functions
**
** Description:
**	This function executes simple aggregate functions using optimizations
**	available to DMF based on knowledge of storage structures. This
**	function is intended to be called by a 'dml' layer wrapper, invoked
**	from QEF for the 'SAGG' nodes. In addition to providing the
**	ADE_EXCB information needed for DMF to drive the aggregate computation,
** 	QEF provides information as to whether this is a 'limited' aggregate
**	request, and if so, which 'limited' aggregates are requested.
**	The following aggregates are considered 'limited' aggregates:
**	MIN
**	MAX
**	COUNT
**
**	A 'limited' aggregate request is one which contains only combinations
**	of limited aggregates, without any non-limited aggregates such as
**	SUM included in the request. The DMF aggregate processor is able
**	to apply additional optimizations in these cases.
**
**
** Inputs:
**	rcb                             The RCB to get a record from.
**	rec   	 			Pointer to location to place record.

** Name: build_sagg_actions - Build action blocks to process simple aggregates
**
** Description:
**	This function fills in one or more 'DMF aggregate action blocks',
**	(DM2A_AGGACT) that describe the steps needed to process the requested
**	aggregates. Each block will represent a scan of all or part of the
**	table, depending on the aggregates present and the storage structure.
**	SEE BLOCK COMMENT AT TOP OF FILE FOR POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS OF
**	AGGS and STRUCTURES, AND THE RESULTING ACTIONS THAT ARE TAKEN.
**
**
** Inputs:
**	rcb                             The RCB to get a record from.
**	agglims				bitmap of 'limiting aggregates'
**	act				ptr to mem in which to place actions
**
** Outputs:
**	nacts				Number of actions placed in 'act'
**	countloc			Indicates where to obtain 'count' from.
**	err_code                        The reason for error status.
**					    E_DM0165_AGG_BAD_OPTS
**					    E_DM0073_RECORD_ACCESS_CONFLICT
** Returns:
**	E_DB_OK
**	E_DB_ERROR
**
** Exceptions:
**	none
**
** Side Effects:
**	none
**
** Assumptions:
**	'act' memory has been allocated for max number of actions.
**	'rcb' passed in has been positioned based on qualification,
**	or for all records, if no qualification.

/*{
** Name: dm2a_get_isam_backwards - Read ISAM table in pseudo-backwards fashion.
**
** Description:
**	This function serves as a wrapper to dm2r_get() and takes the same
**	parameters as dm2r_get(), but will cause records from an ISAM
**	table to be returned in a pseudo-backwards order - that is -
**	while the data returned is not in reverse-sorted order, the data
**	is returned from succesively decreasing main-pages and their
**	overflow chains. This is used by the MAX on ISAM processing
**	to ensure that the highest range of data is seen first, with 
**	sucessively lower ranges seen. A flag passed in indicates that
**	EOF should be returned when reaching the end of the current chain,
**	to optimize the situation where a qualifying tuple has been identified,
**	and we must simply exhaust its key range for any other contenders.
**
**
** Inputs:
**		MUST BE TYPED SAME AS DM2R_GET - called interchangeably.
**
**      rcb                             The RCB to get a record from.
**      tid                             ptr to tid which is just used as a
**					indicator of whether to return EOS
**					upon end of chain - TRUE/FALSE.
**      opflag                          must be DM2R_GETNEXT
**
** Outputs:
**      record                          Pointer to location to return record.
**      err_code                        The reason for error status.

** Returns:
**	E_DB_OK
**	E_DB_ERROR
**
** Exceptions:
**	none
**
** Side Effects:
**	Tid values in the RCB are changed.
**
** Assumptions:
**	Relies on ISAM storage format, in particular, that all mainpages
**	are arranged in ascending order in the file.
**
** Related Functions:
**	Called by function ptr that is also used for dm2r_get().
**
** History:
**	05-Sep-1995 (cohmi01)
**	    Created, for aggregate optimizations.
**	06-may-1996 (thaju02)
**	    New page format support: change page header references to use
**	    macros.
