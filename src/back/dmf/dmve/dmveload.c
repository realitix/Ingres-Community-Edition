**  Description:
**          dmve_load - The recovery of a load table operation.
**
**
**  History:
**	29-sep-87 (rogerk)
**	    Created new for Jupiter. 
**	6-Oct-88 (Edhsu)
**	    Fix error mapping bug
**	22-jan-90 (rogerk)
**	    Make sure the page buffer is aligned on ALIGN_RESTRICT boundary
**	    for byte-align machines.
**      14-jun-90 (jennifer)
**          Change routines to use dm1sbbegin and dm1sbend routines
**          to build empty files.  These routines were used to insure
**          all the new file header, bit map information was set correctly.
**          For bulkload into a heap with data, a new recovery algorithm
**          was used to insure file header and bit map were retained.
**	30-Dec-1991 (rmuth)
**	    When we abort a load into an empty Btree table we just rebuild
**	    an empty btree table ontop of the loaded table. We do this by
**	    calling the build routines dm1bbbegin and dm1bbend, the dm1bbbegin
**	    routine expects certain fields in the mct control block to be set,
**	    these fields are subsequently used during the dm1bbput operations.
**	    As we do not use dm1bbput we were not setting these fields hence
**	    dm1bbbegin was issuing an error. As we already have the values
**	    in the TCB we initialise the values in the mct.
**	8-Jan-1992 (rmuth)
**	    Abort of a LOAD operation was causing relpages and reltups
**	    to be set to incorrect values.
**	13-feb-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Set mct_allocation and mct_extend.
**	28-may-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Set mct_inmemory and mct_rebuild.
**	07-july-1992 (jnash)
**	    Add DMF function prototyping 
**	09-jun-1992 (kwatts)
**	    6.5 MPF Changes. Set mct_compressed from relcomptype.
**	    Set up new mct_data_atts instead of mct_atts_ptr (removed).
**	29-August-1992 (rmuth)
**	   Add parameter to dm1p_lastused.
**	3-oct-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Re-arrange includes to share transaction ID type definition.
**	05-oct-1992 (rogerk)
**	    Reduced Logging Project.  In preparation for support of Partial
**	    TCB's for the new recovery schemes, changed references to
**	    some tcb fields to use the new tcb_table_io structure fields.
**	26-oct-1992 (rogerk)
**	    Reduced Logging Project: Changed arguments to dm0p_mutex and
**	    dm0p_unmutex call(s)s.
**	30-October-1992 (rmuth)
**	   Set the mct_guarantee_on_disk flag.
**	8-oct-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Initialize mct_buildrcb.
**	14-dec-1992 (jnash)
**	    Reduced logging project.  Back off the previous change 
**	    (in 6.5, never used in 6.4) where we always created an
**	    empty table, revert back to the old 6.4 file swapping 
**	    behavior.  This is because of recovery problems when someone 
**	    first deletes all rows in a table (including rows on overflow 
**	    pages), and then performs a load, and then aborts the load.  
**	    In this case installing an empty table is not the thing to do.
**	    Upcoming "with emptytable" option will once again introduce
**	    this feature.
**	14-dec-1992 (rogerk)
**	    Include dm1b.h before dm0l.h for prototype definitions.
**	08-feb-1993 (rmuth)
**	    Use DM2T_A_OPEN_NOACCESS when opening the table so that
**	    we do not check the FHDR/FMAP as these may be ill at the
**	    moment.
**	24-may-1993 (bryanp)
**	    Include <pc.h> before <lk.h> to pick up PID definition.
**	14-jul-93 (ed)
**	    replacing <dbms.h> by <gl.h> <sl.h> <iicommon.h> <dbdbms.h>
**	18-oct-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Changed heap load undo recovery to rewrite the allocated pages to
**	    be free pages rather than leaving them as formatted data pages.
**	    This allows verifydb and patch table to run without danger
**	    of thinking the freed pages should be restored and the tuples
**	    resurrected.  Also ifdef'd code which does recovery for structured
**	    tables when the EMPTY_TABLE copy option is specified.
**	18-oct-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Added dmve_unreserve_space call to release logfile space
**	    reserved for logforces in the purge tcb call.
**	15-apr-1994 (chiku)

/*{
** Name: dmve_load - The recovery of a load table opration.
**
** Description:
**
**	This function performs UNDO recovery of a load operation.
**	Load operations are NON-REDO and are not journalled.
**
**	User tables are loaded in two different ways.  For HEAP 
**	tables, rows are added to the already existing table.  For HASH,
**	BTREE and ISAM, a new file is created and loaded, and then 
**	renamed to the base file.  The method used is given by 
**	log_rec->dul_recreate.
**
**      If dul_recreate is set, recovery will have already destroyed the
**      new file and moved the old one back in place.  All we have to do is
**      close-purge the TCB.
**
**      If dul_recreate is not set, then we have to delete all the rows that
**      were added to the table.  We also have to deal with the possibility
**      that the load was killed off in the middle of a file extend, which
**      may leave some overflow pointers invalid.  To avoid these problems,
**      we bypass normal access methods and just read through the file page
**      by page, formatting each as an empty data page.
**
**      For HEAP files one can also bulkload into a table with data.
**	To support recovery for this type of bulkload, a new variable
**      was added to the log record and indicates that last valid page
**      of the heap table before the load began.  In all other cases this
**      variable is set to zero.  To recover this operation, all pages
**      allocated after the page indicated by the lastpage variable, are
**      freed and the overflow pointer on the lastpage is set to zero.
**     
**
** Inputs:
**	dmve_cb
**	    .dmve_log_rec	    The load table operation log record.
**	    .dmve_action	    Should only be DMVE_UNDO.
**	    .dmve_lg_addr	    The log address of the log record.
**	    .dmve_dcb_ptr	    Pointer to DCB.
**	    .dmve_tran_id	    The physical transaction id.
**	    .dmve_lk_id		    The transaction lock list id.
**	    .dmve_log_id	    The logging system database id.
**	    .dmve_db_lockmode	    The lockmode of the database. Should be 
**				    DM2T_X or DM2T_S.
**
** Outputs:
**	dmve_cb
**	    .dmve_error.err_code    The reason for error status.
**	Returns:
**	    E_DB_OK
**	    E_DB_ERROR
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	    none
**
** History:
**	29-sep-87 (rogerk)
**	    Created new for Jupiter. 
**	22-jan-90 (rogerk)
**	    Make sure the page buffer is aligned on ALIGN_RESTRICT boundary
**	    for byte-align machines.
**      14-jun-90 (jennifer)
**          Change routines to use dm1sbbegin and dm1sbend routines
**          to build empty files.  These routines were used to insure
**          all the new file header, bit map information was set correctly.
**          For bulkload into a heap with data, a new recovery algorithm
**          was used to insure file header and bit map were retained.
**	30-Dec-1991 (rmuth)
**	    When we abort a load into an empty Btree table we just rebuild
**	    an empty btree table ontop of the loaded table. We do this by
**	    calling the build routines dm1bbbegin and dm1bbend, the dm1bbbegin
**	    routine expects certain fields in the mct control block to be set,
**	    these fields are subsequently used during the dm1bbput operations.
**	    As we do not use dm1bbput we were not setting these fields hence
**	    dm1bbbegin was issuing an error. As we already have the values
**	    in the TCB we initialise the values in the mct.
**	8-Jan-1992 (rmuth)
**	    Abort of load was setting reltups and relpages to incorrect values,
**	    because it was not taking into account the fact that the update of
**	    relpages and reltups is logged by a SREP record which is also
**	    rolled back causing relpages and reltups to be set to their 
**	    correct preload values. The fix is to set tcb_page_adds and
**	    tcb_tup_adds to zero so that relpages and reltups are left alone
**	    by the rollback of the LOAD log record.
**	13-feb-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Set mct_allocation and mct_extend. The build routines won't actually
**	    need these, since we're rebuilding over an existing file, but it's
**	    good to set all our parameters before calling the build routines,
**	    just as a matter of practice.
**	28-may-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Set mct_inmemory and mct_rebuild to 0.
**	09-jun-1992 (kwatts)
**	    6.5 MPF Changes. Set mct_compressed from relcomptype.
**	    Set up new mct_data_atts instead of mct_atts_ptr (removed).
**	29-August-1992 (rmuth)
**	   Add parameter to dm1p_lastused.
**	30-October-1992 (rmuth)
**	   Set the mct_guarantee_on_disk flag.
**	8-oct-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Initialize mct_buildrcb.
**	14-dec-1992 (jnash)
**	    Reduced logging project.  Back off the previous change 
**	    (in 6.5, never used in 6.4) where we always created an
**	    empty table, revert back to the old 6.4 file swapping

**	    In this case installing an empty table is not the thing to do.
**	    Upcoming "with emptytable" option will once again introduce
**	    this feature.
**	08-feb-1993 (rmuth)
**	    Use DM2T_A_OPEN_NOACCESS when opening the table so that
**	    we do not check the FHDR/FMAP as these may be ill at the
**	    moment.
**	18-oct-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Changed heap load recovery to rewrite the allocated pages to
**	    be free pages rather than leaving them as formatted data pages.
**	    This allows verifydb and patch table to run without danger

**	15-apr-1994 (chiku)
**	    Bug56702: return logfull indication.
**	06-mar-1996 (stial01 for bryanp)
**	    Pass page_size to format accessor.
**	06-may-1996 (thaju02)
**	    New page format support: change page header references to use
**	    macros.
**      21-may-1997 (stial01)
**          Added flags arg to dm0p_unmutex call(s).
**	01-Dec-2004 (jenjo02)
**	    Added DM0P_TABLE_LOCKED_X flag for bug 108074 completeness.
**      21-Sep-2006 (kschendel)
**          Apparently this never worked for partitions!  Fix.
**          Also, it's probably a bad idea to open the load table NOACCESS.
**          And finally, don't use TABLE_LOCKED_X here because we might
**          be processing an fhdr/fmap in the loop that reformats DATA
**          pages as free.  Causes Unfix RELEASE warnings in the BM.
**          We never update fmap/fhdr so don't worry about LOCKED_X.
**	16-Nov-2009 (kschendel) SIR 122890
**	    Don't close-purge the TCB if the load was non-recreate load.
**	    We may not have a control lock in that situation, and there's
**	    no need to close-purge anyway unless it was a recreate load.
**	13-Apr-2010 (kschendel) SIR 123485
**	    Open no-coupon to avoid unnecessary LOB overhead.
