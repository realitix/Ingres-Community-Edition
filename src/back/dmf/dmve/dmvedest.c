/*{
** Name: dmve_destroy - The recovery of a destroy table opration.
**
** Description:
**	This function re-execute the destroy table opration using the
**	parameters stored in the log record. The system table changes,
**	the file creation and the file rename operations associated
**	with this destroy table operation appear later in the journal
**	file, so these opeorations are not performed during recovery.
**	This routine has UNDO code to purge the tcb of the destroyed table.  
**      If this is a secondary index, purge the base table's tcb.
**
**	When performing rollforward of a destroy table operation, we need to
**	purge the table. We are about to destroy the physical underlying file
**	for the table (when we encounter the FRENAME operation, a few records
**	later in the journal). Before we destroy the underlying file, however,
**	we'd better ensure that there are no pages in rollforward's buffer
**	cache for this table. That is the purpose of purging the table. Before
**	we added this purge of the table during rollforward, we were susceptible
**	to bug B43580, in which we'd rolled forward some operations on a table
**	which made some pages for the table resident in the cache, then
**	rolled forward a DROP TABLE operation, which deleted the underlying
**	file.
**
**	We had failed to purge the table, however, and so the pages hung
**	around in the cache, and eventually got flushed out by normal cache
**	flushing operations. On most systems, the request to delete the file
**	while it was still open had been deferred until the last opener of the
**	file closed the file, and thus we were still able to come back later
**	and flush out the pages.
**
**	However, not all implementations of DIdelete operate this way. In
**	particular, on Unix systems where the DI layer may LRU-out file
**	descriptors (close and re-open them "under the covers"), a DIdelete on
**	an open DI file is deferred only until that DI file gets LRU-d out, at
**	which point the delete takes effect, and later reads and writes to the
**	file fail with "file not found". So if the order of operations was:
**		1) roll forward some operation on the table making a page
**		   resident.
**		2) roll forward the delete table and the FRENAME and call
**		   DIdelete on the underlying file.
**		3) LRU the file out within DI
**		4) Attempt to write the resident page out.
**	then the DIwrite call in step (4) failed with DI_FILENOTFOUND (!).
**
**	By close-purging the table here, we ensure that when the delete the file
**	upon encountering the FRENAME, the file is truly closed at that point
**	and the delete takes effect immediately.
**
** Inputs:
**	dmve_cb
**	    .dmve_log_rec	    The destroy table operation log record.
**	    .dmve_action	    Should only be DMVE_DO.
**	    .dmve_dcb_ptr	    Pointer to DCB.
**
** Outputs:
**	dmve_cb
**	    .dmve_error.err_code    The reason for error status.
**	Returns:
**	    E_DB_OK
**	    E_DB_ERROR
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	    none
**
** History:
**	30-jun-86 (ac)
**          Created for Jupiter.
**	03-jun-88 (teg)
**	    Added logic to verify tcb exists before purgeing it.
**	10-apr-1992 (bryanp)
**	    B43580: When rolling forward a destroy, purge the table.
**	28-nov-1992 (jnash)
