/*{
** Name: dmve_dmu - The recovery of a DMU opration.
**
** Description:
**	This routine is used for ROLLBACK recovery of a DMU operation.
**
**	DMU operations are not IDEMPOTENT during backout.  That means that we
**	cannot re-execute abort recovery on operations that occured after a
**	DMU operation, if the DMU operation has already been aborted.
**
**	This is because the recovery of many operations makes the assumption
**	the the basic state of the table (storage structure, number of pages,
**	file layout) is the similar to the state it was in when the operation
**	was logged.
**
**	If we abort the following transaction:
**
**	    CREATE newtab (a = i4)
**	    APPEND newtab (a = 1)
**
**	And the server doing the abort crashes after aborting the CREATE,
**	but before completing the abort, then the RCP will start over with
**	recovery on that transaction.  But the RCP cannot attempt to re-execute
**	the abort of the APPEND statement because the table 'newtab' no longer
**	exists.  (Worse cases are when the server died while in the middle of
**	aborting the CREATE - and left the catalogs in an inconsistent state.)
**
**	To solve this, we write a DM0L_DMU log record whenever we issue an
**	operation for which recovery is not idempotent.  This log record must
**	be written AFTER the operation is complete so that recovery is done
**	before the operation is recovered (while recovery can still be
**	re-executed).
**
**	When we encounter a DM0L_DMU log record during abort processing, we
**	lay down a CLR record which points to the record before the DMU 
**	record.  If we re-execute abort processing on this transaction,
**	we will encounter the CLR and jump over the already backed-out 
**	operations and begin with recovery on the DMU operation
**	itself (which by itself must be idempotent).
**
**	Since we must write a CLR record during recovery, LG must make
**	sure the is room in the log file to write one CLR (and
**	force it to disk) for all DMU operations active in the system.
**
** Inputs:
**	dmve_cb
**	    .dmve_log_rec	    The dmu operation log record.
**	    .dmve_action	    Should only be DMVE_UNDO.
**	    .dmve_dcb_ptr	    Pointer to DCB.
**	    .dmve_tran_id	    The physical transaction id.
**	    .dmve_lk_id		    The transaction lock list id.
**	    .dmve_log_id	    The logging system database id.
**	    .dmve_db_lockmode	    The lockmode of the database. Should be 
**				    DM2T_X or DM2T_S.
**
** Outputs:
**	dmve_cb
**	    .dmve_error.err_code    The reason for error status.
**	Returns:
**	    E_DB_OK
**	    E_DB_ERROR
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	    none
**
** History:
**	11-sep-89 (rogerk)
**          Created for Terminator.
**	25-sep-1991 (mikem) integrated following change: 20-sep-89 (rogerk)
**	    When write ABORTSAVE record, use address in dmu_sp_addr.
**	25-sep-1991 (mikem) integrated following change: 10-jan-90 (rogerk)
**	    If DMVE says the abort is being done by the CSP, then pass
**	    the DM0L_CLUSTER_REQ flag to dm0l_abortsave.
**	20-oct-1992 (jnash)
**	    Reduced logging project.  Write CLR's instead of abort-save
**	    log records.  
**	18-jan-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Reduced Logging Project: Removed OFFLINE_CSP flag.
**	15-mar-1993 (jnash)
**	    Check dmve->dmve_logging to determine if logging required.
**      26-apr-1993 (bryanp)
**          6.5 Cluster support:
**              Replace all uses of DM_LOG_ADDR with LG_LA or LG_LSN.
**		Remove special checks for DCB_S_CSP, since DCB's built by the
**		    CSP process no longer get special handling.
**	23-aug-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Added support for rollforward of CLR records.
**	    Took out old dm0p_force_pages call (which wrote out records
**	    updated by the current transaction) and replaced it with a
**	    dm0p_toss_pages call - which tosses out all pages belonging
**	    to the dmu table.
**	15-apr-1994 (chiku)
**	    Bug56702: return logfull indication.
