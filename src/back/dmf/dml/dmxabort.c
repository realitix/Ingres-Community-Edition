/**
** Name: DMXABORT.C - Functions used to abort a Transaction.
**
** Description:
**      This file contains the functions necessary to abort a transaction.
**      This file defines:
**    
**      dmx_abort()        -  Routine to perform the abort 
**                            transaction operation.
**
** History:
**      01-sep-85 (jennifer)
**          Created for Jupiter.      
**	21-jul-86 (Derek)
**	    Upgrade for full logging support.
**	30-sep-1988 (rogerk)
**	    Added capability to treat transactions as read-only until first
**	    write operation is performed.  If DELAYBT flag is still on in the
**	    XCB at abort time, then treat the transaction as a read-only
**	    transaction.
**	30-Jan-89 (ac)
**	    Added 2PC support.
**	17-jan-1990 (rogerk)
**	    Added capability to not log savepoints until first write operation
**	    is performed.
**	 4-feb-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Added support for Set Nologging.  If abort is called on a Nologging
**	    transaction then report and return an error.
**	25-feb-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Changed Set Nologging abort error from an ERUSF error number to
**	    a DMF error number to follow error number conventions.
**	25-mar-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Changed the way nologging transactions are aborted.  Now flag is
**	    passed down to DMXE_BEGIN which will cause the database to be
**	    marked inconsistent.
**	13-may-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Check for database inconsistency errors being returned from
**	    dmxe_abort call.  We should remove our DMF transaction
**	    data structures before returning the error to ensure that
**	    the session can be removed from the server without getting
**	    open-transaction errors.
**	19-aug-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Bug # 38403
**	    Fix error cleaning up after failed Set Nologging transaction.
**	    Don't attempt abort processing for Nologging session on an
**	    Abort to Savepoint request.
**	17-oct-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Great Merge of DMF : Move 6.4 changes into 6.5.  In this case,
**	    the 6.4 version of this file was moved directly to 6.5 and the
**	    6.5 changes were merged back in:
**
**	    14-jun-1991 (Derek)
**		Added performance profiling support.
**	16-jan-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Temporary table enhancements: drop open temp tables during abort.
**	8-jul-1992 (walt)
**	    Prototyping DMF.
**	3-oct-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Re-arrange includes to share transaction ID type definition.
**	26-oct-1992 (rogerk)
**	    Reduced Logging Project:  Checked for errors during abort-to-svpt
**	    operations.  If we fail during an attempt to rollback to a savepoint
**	    we now mark the transaction as requiring a full rollback.  Otherwise
**	    the database is left in an unknown state.
**	15-mar-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Reduced Logging - Phase IV:
**	    Changed Savepoints to be tracked by LSN rather than Log Address.
**	    Removed old xcb_abt_sp_addr needed with BI recovery.
**      26-apr-1993 (bryanp)
**          6.5 Cluster support:
**              Replace all uses of DM_LOG_ADDR with LG_LA or LG_LSN.
**		Pass a NULL DCB pointer to dmxe_abort.
**	14-jul-93 (ed)
**	    replacing <dbms.h> by <gl.h> <sl.h> <iicommon.h> <dbdbms.h>
**	26-jul-1993 (bryanp)
**	    Disallow abort to savepoint if the transaction is already prepared.
**	    Include <lk.h> to pick up locking system type definitions.
**	    Include <pc.h> before <lk.h> to pick up PID definition
**	20-sep-1993 (andys)
**	    When we force abort, print an informative message to the errlog.log
**	    This is bug 49861 in 6.4.
**	18-oct-1993 (rogerk)
**	    When a temporary table is open by more than rcb in this transaction,
**	    only pass the close-destroy request on the last close of the temp
**	    table.  This change was necessitated by new dm2t_release_tcb logic
**	    which waits for busy tcb's rather than pending a destroy action.
**	31-jan-1994 (bryanp) B58558, B58561
**	    Check return code from dm2t_destroy_temp_tcb.
**	    Check return code from LGshow.
**      04-apr-1995 (dilma04)
**        (Re)Initialize scb_isolation_level.
**	30-may-96 (stephenb)
**	    Check for and clean up (close table for) replication input queue
**	    RCB.
**	05-nov-1996 (somsa01)
**	    In dmx_abort(), if a temporary (etab) table is being deleted, take
**	    its dmt_cb off of the scb list so that it will not try to be
**	    deleted again in dmpe_free_temps().
**      12-feb-97 (dilma04)
**          Set Lockmode Cleanup:
**          Replaced scb_isolation_level with scb_tran_iso.
**	27-Feb-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Extended <set transaction statement> to support <transaction 
**	    access mode> (READ ONLY | READ WRITE) per SQL-92.
**	    Added SET SESSION <access mode>
**	    Reset scb_tran_am.
**	3-jun-97 (nanpr01)
**	    Fix bug 78352 : When transactions are rolled back, temporary
**	    tables that were updated does not get dropped as documented.
** 	17-jun-1997 (wonst02)
** 	    Changes for readonly database.
**	25-Aug-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Added log_id parm to dm2t_destroy_temp_tcb() calls.
**      12-nov-97 (stial01)
**          dmx_abort() Reset scb_tran_iso = DMC_C_SYSTEM;
**	11-Aug-1998 (jenjo02)
**	    Clear rcb_tup_adds, rcb_page_adds to cancel effects
**	    of this txn on a table.
**	29-dec-1998 (stial01)
**          dmx_abort() if taking DMT_CB off scb->scb_lo_next queue,
**          call dm0m_deallocate().
**	15-Dec-1999 (jenjo02)
**	    Support for SHARED log transactions, multiple txns
**	    scheduled to be aborted (dmx_show()).
**      18-jan-2000 (gupsh01)
**          Added setting DMXE_NONJNLTAB in order to identify transactions
**          which alter nonjournaled tables of a journaled database.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	08-Nov-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Deleted xcb_tq_next|prev, xccb_tq_next|prev.
**	    To find session temp tables which need to be destroyed,
**	    examine XCCB list on ODCB.
**	10-sep-2001 (somsa01)
**	    Corrected previous cross-integration by changing nat's
**	    and longnat's to i4's.
**	12-Oct-2001 (devjo01)
**	    In dmx_abort, fixed casting of some pointers to ule_format,
**	    and more importantly corrected one call to dm0m_deallocate
**	    which was being passed a xccb, where *xccb was intended.
**	05-Nov-2001 (hanje04)
**	    Backed out changes related to bug 103567 becuase all global
**	    temp tables are being removed by rollback.
**	05-Mar-2002 (jenjo02)
**	    Call dms_end_tran() for Sequence Generators.

/*{
** Name: dmx_abort - Aborts a transaction.
**
**  INTERNAL DMF call format:      status = dmx_abort(&dmx_cb);
**
**  EXTERNAL call format:          status = dmf_call(DMX_ABORT,&dmx_cb);
**
** Description:
**    The dmx_abort function handles the aborting of a transaction.
**    This includes aborting to a savepoint previously defined by a 
**    dmx_savepoint operation.  This function causes all internal control
**    information associated with this transaction to be released.  This
**    will automatically close all the opens of tables associated with this 
**    transaction.
**
**    If DMX_ABORT is called on an update NOLOGGING transaction, then the
**    transaction context will be removed, the database will be marked
**    inconsistent, and an error will be returned.  Since no logging was 
**    performed, no recovery is done.  The error returned will 
**    be E_DM0146_SETLG_XCT_ABORT.
**
**    If a rollback to savepoint is requested on a NOLOGGING transaction, then
**    no abort will be done, and an error will be returned.  The database will
**    not be marked inconsistent at that time nor will the transaction context
**    be removed.  It is expected that the DMF client will, upon failure to
**    rollback to the savepoint, request a transaction rollback.  The database
**    will then be marked inconsistent following the rules stated above.
**
**	Any temporary table which is open for update by this transaction is
**	automatically dropped. This is because operations against temporary
**	tables are not logged, and so they can't be backed out, and since we
**	don't want to allow the users to access any potentially corrupt
**	temporary tables, we drop the table. 
**
** Inputs:
**      dmx_cb 
**          .type                           Must be set to DMX_TRANSACTION_CB.

** History:

**          Created for Jupiter.

**	17-jan-1990 (rogerk)
**	    Added capability to not log savepoints until first write operation

**	    savepoint record written, then treat the operation as a read-only
**	    abort.
**	 4-feb-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Added support for Set Nologging.  If abort is called on a Nologging
**	    transaction then report and return an error.
**	25-mar-1991 (rogerk)

**	13-may-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Check for database inconsistency errors being returned from

**	    transaction context from the system even though we cannot
**	    continue the rollback.  We should remove our DMF transaction

**	19-aug-1991 (rogerk)
**	    Bug # 38403
**	    Fix error cleaning up after failed Set Nologging transaction.
**	    Don't attempt abort processing for Nologging session on an
**	    Abort to Savepoint request.  Return an error, but don't mark
**	    the database inconsistent.  When the caller sees the abort
**	    error, it will probably escalate the abort to the transaction
**	    level, at which time the database will be marked inconsistent.
**	    Marking the database inconsistent during savepoint processing
**	    would cause us to release the LG context without cleaning up
**	    the XCB.  This would leave us in a state where we were unable
**	    to clean up the session and close the database properly.
**	17-oct-1991 (rogerk)

**	16-jan-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Temporary table enhancements: when closing the open tables, if
**	    a table is a temporary table which was opened for update access,

**	7-jul-94 (robf)
**          Purge RCB on close if write transaction and peripheral table,
**	    this is to work around a problem where the peripheral information

**	11-Nov-2005 (jenjo02)

**	    force-aborted to keep the log from becoming full,
**	    hence dm0p_check_logfull() isn't the right check
**	    to make. When the txn is marked XCB_FORCE_ABORT,
