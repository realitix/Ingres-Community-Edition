/**
** Name: QEFACT.H - This file describes the action control block
**
** Description:
**      The Action Control Block describes a specific action
**      (query execution, file creation, etc) that must be
**      executed to completion before the next action is begun.
**      One or more actions constitute a statement.

** Name: QEF_PROC_RESOURCE - DBP specific info for resources
**
** Description:
**
**	This variant of a resource list entry is for table procedures
**	used by the query plan.  There is one entry per distinct
**	table proc.
**
**	DB procedures aren't "validated" as such, so we don't make
**	resource list entries for other DB procedure usages (explicit
**	callproc or rule-fired dbproc).  Table procs are more deeply
**	entwined into a particular action's qep, though, and the
**	tproc is opened and its tables validated at the start of the
**	QP just like we do for tables.

**	13-jan-94 (rickh)
**	    Removed a dreaded trigraph sequence.
**	5-june-2008 (dougi)

/*}
** Name: QEF_RESOURCE - Defines a object resource that is used by a query plan
**
** Description:
**      This struct forms a linked list of all database objects that a query
**      plan uses. There will be one struct for each object (table, dbproc,
**      etc) used, optionally with all usage instances of the object hanging 
**	off of it.
**      This structure servers several functions:
**	    - it generalizes the list of objects to be validated from
**	      tables to all objects.
**	    - it provides a unique list of objects
**	    - it plays a part in sharing open tables (dmr_cb's), which
**	      reduces the amount of resources that a query plan needs.
**       
**      Currently, only tables and procedures are defined. In the future,
**      other db objects should be added to the list.
**       
**      The resource list is now the "real" list of object to be validated.
**      The QEF_VALID struct now indicates that a table needs to be opened,
**      not validated as it's name implies. Unfortunately, QEF_VALID structs
**      are everywhere, so the name stands for the time being.

/*}
** Name: QEF_VALID - List of tables to open
**
** Description:
**	The valid list is an obsolete name for the list of tables to
**	open.  Each action that needs tables opened has a list of
**	QEF_VALID entries indicating which tables and what mode to use.
**	A table might be listed multiple times if there are multiple
**	references (correlation names / cursors) to that table.
**	The action list is linked by the vl_next field.
**
**	Each valid list entry is also accessible from a resource list
**	entry, which is the actual validator entry.  vl_alt links
**	all valid entries for the same table (ie resource).
**
**	By convention, the last element in the list is the result
**	relation (if there is any).   (is this still true??)
**
**	Valid-list entries are part of the query plan, and as such are
**	read-only.  Limited exceptions are made for situations where the
**	query plan can't reasonably be shared, such as a CTAS, where we
**	need to fill in the actual table ID created.
**
**	Note: with the creation of the resource list, QEF_VALID no longer
**	represents the list of tables to validate. Instead, the QEF_VALID
**	struct represents an open instance of a table in a query plan 
**	(QEF_VALID always has had the latter meaning, it no longer has the
**	former meaning). Along with this change, QEF_VALID structs now live
**	on the top most action that uses them (meaning that actions below
**	QEN_QP nodes still don't have valid structs).
**
** History:
**     18-mar-86 (daved)
**          written
**	28-jul-87 (daved & puree)
**	    add a field, vl_alt, which groups all valid list entries
**	    of the same range variable.
**	16-feb-88 (puree)
**	    added the vl_est_pages, vl_total_pages, and vl_status.
**	    Removed the vl_lock_mode.  QEF will figure out the appropriate
**	    lock mode from vl_est_pages and vl_rw.
**	12-Jan-93 (jhahn)
**	    added vl_flags and vl_tab_id_index for handling set input
**	    parameters.
**      15-oct-93 (eric)
**          Added support for resource lists
**      19-dec-94 (sarjo01) from 18-feb-94 (markm)
**          added the vl_mustlock flag to make sure that we readlock even
**          if "nolocks" has been set when updating a relation. (58681)
**	11-feb-97 (inkdo01)
**	    Add QEF_MCNSTTBL flag to identify MS Access OR transformed
**	    in memory constant tables (vl_dmr_cb is used to store table
**	    address for these guys)
**	12-nov-1998 (somsa01)
**	    Added QEF_SESS_TEMP for Global Temporary Tables.  (Bug #94059)
**	3-dec-03 (inkdo01)
**	    Updated for partitioned table access.
**	5-june-2008 (dougi)
**	    Added QEF_TPROC flag for table procedures.
**	20-Nov-2009 (kschendel) SIR 122890
**	    Add needs-Xlock flag.
**	14-june-2010 (dougi)
**	    Add dbname for IVW.
**	17-Jun-2010 (kschendel) b123775

/*}
** Name: QEF_DMU - 
**
** Description:
**	A DMU action header is compiled for CREATE TABLE AS SELECT
**	(or DGTT AS SELECT).  Actually, several DMU action headers may
**	be compiled, depending on circumstances.
**
**	DMU action headers can also be compiled for situations that
**	require an implicit temp table, such as subqueries that
**	generate function aggregates, or projections of by-lists.
**
**	A DMU action header indicates a DMU operation (create, modify, etc)
**	is to take place within the context of an enclosing statement.
**	DMU operations can take place in the context of a standalone
**	statement as well, but in that case either a different kind of
**	action header is compiled (e.g. CTBL for CREATE TABLE), or
**	no query plan is produced at all (e.g. MODIFY and CREATE INDEX,
**	which flow directly from the parse to the sequencer to QEF
**	into the QEU_DBU function).
**
**	The action header has a pointer to the DMF control block, which
**	is typically a DMU_CB.  For implicit temporary table creation,
**	the control block might be a DMT_CB.  (QEF will be doing a
**	direct create-temp call to DMF instead of a DMU call that
**	asks for a temporary table.  I guess there's a difference.
**	Also QEF does some extra whirling to re-use implicit temporary
**	tables in some cases.)
**
**	When an action creates (or possibly modifies) a partitioned
**	table, the individual physical partitions may have particular
**	characteristics, such as a location.  OPC will attach the
**	QEU_LOGPART_CHAR blocks created by the parse to this action
**	header, so that QEF can do the right thing as it creates
**	partitions.  For now, the QEU_LOGPART_CHAR list will only be
**	found attached to a CREATE TABLE action, but in theory such
**	a list could be attached to MODIFY or CREATE INDEX actions too.
**
**	Presently the only DMF actions that will be seen are create
**	table, modify table, and create temporary table.  All other
**	possibilities are compiled differently for now.
**
** History:
**	??? ???
**	    probably around the time of create schema.
**	9-Feb-2004 (schka24)

[@comment_line@]...
**
** History:
**	02-dec-92 (rickh)
**	    Created for FIPS CONSTRAINTS project.
**	30-jan-93 (rickh)
**	    Added pointers to more objects which just persist across
**	    execute immediates.
**	17-feb-93 (rickh)
**	    Added schema name to QEF_CREATE_INTEGRITY_STATEMENT.
**	26-mar-93 (andre)
**	    added qci_indep.  When processing creation of a new REFERENCES
**	    privilege, it will point at a PSQ_INDEP_OBJECTS structure describing
**	    a UNIQUE or PRIMARY KEY constraint and, if the owner of the
**	    <referenced table> is different from that of the <referencing
**	    table>, description of a REFERENCES privilege on column(s) of the
**	    <referenced table> on which the new constraint will depend
**	2-apr-93 (rickh)
**	    Added integrity number to QEF_CREATE_INTEGRITY.
**	9-aug-93 (rickh)
**	    Added a flag to the QEF_CREATE_INTEGRITY statement instructing
**	    QEF to cook up a SELECT statement verifying that a REFERENTIAL
**	    CONSTRAINT actually holds.  Also added a remembrance of the 
**	    REFERENTIAL CONSTRAINT creator's initial state.
**	26-aug-93 (rickh)
**	    Added flag to integrity action to remind us to save the rowcount
**	    if this NOT NULL integrity is part of a CREATE TABLE AS SELECT
**	    statement.
**	17-jan-94 (rickh)
**	    In the CREATE INTEGRITY header, split the modifyRefingProcedure
**	    field into two fields: insertRefingProcedure and
**	    updateRefingProcedure.
**	18-apr-94 (rblumer)
**	    changed qci_integrityTuple2 to qci_knownNotNullableTuple.
**	31-mar-98 (inkdo01)
**	    Added fields to support constraint index definition with clause.
**	26-may-98 (inkdo01)
**	    Added flags for delete/update cascade/set null referential actions.
**	20-oct-98 (inkdo01)
**	    Added flags for delete/update restrict refact.
**	3-may-2007 (dougi)
**	    Added flag to force table to btree on constrained columns (instead
**	    of building secondary index).
**	15-dec-2008 (dougi)
**	    Added QCI_X100_CONS flag to identify constraints on X100 tables.
**	28-Jul-2010 (kschendel) SIR 124104
**	    Add compression flags (same as PST_RESTAB pst_compress flags)
**	    so that autostruct can keep compression.
**	18-Oct-2010 (kschendel) SIR 124544
**	    Replace individual bits and pieces with a DMU_CHARACTERISTICS.

** Name: QEF_AHD - Describe an action
**
** Description:
**      Actions read tuples for QEPs, call DMF, update tuples, provide
**	projections for aggregate processing, etc. They are generally
**	large units of work within a query plan.
**
**	Processing occurs by reading a tuple from a QEP (if one exists) and
**	then calling ADE with values in the QEN_ADF structure to create the 
**	result tuple. The result tuple is then dispatched to DMF or the user.
**
**  NOTES:
**	PROJECTIONS of aggregate function result tables.
**	The processing of aggregate functions that use the standard QUEL
**	semantics (all by values are represented), requires the projection
**	of the "by" values.  These tuples are then joined to the
**	aggregate results on the by-lists so that all by-list values are
**	represented in the aggregate result relation. The QEP for the projection
**	action only needs to retrieve the tuples in the projection, the 
**	ACTION itself will append these tuples to a temporary sort table.
**	The QEP doesn't need to sort the tuples.
**
**	The row buffer used for putting tuples into the projection temp file
**	must be the same as the buffer used for retrieving tuples from
**	the projection temp file. Moreover, the CB used for reading and
**	writing the projection table must be the same. This means that 
**	the ahd_proj field in a AGGF action should be the same as the
**	ahd_odmr_cb field in the corresponding PROJ action.
**
**	Note that until change 448896, the projection technique was also
**	used for SQL function aggregates, even though SQL guarantees one
**	set of grouping columns/expressions for the whole query (making 
**	the projection merge phase unnecessary). Projection is now only
**	done if differing sets of bycols exist amongst the function aggs.
**
**	CX for AGGREGATE_FUNCTIONS
**	ahd_current:
**	    SINIT   put the "by" values to the output row.
**		    initialize the the aggregate result values.
**		    The first tuple must be fetched for SINIT to work.
**	    SMAIN   compare the "by" value from the tuple just retrieve with
**		    the one in the output row.  If the values are equal,
**		    run remaining CX to accumulate the aggregate result. BYCOMPARE
**		    only done for QEA_AGGF, QEA_RAGGF. Rest of aggregation
**		    code is run for all aggregates.
**
**	    SFINIT  finalize the aggregate result value and copy it to
**		    the output row buffer.
**
**	ahd_by_comp:
**	    SINIT   compare the "by" value from the projection tuple to the
**		    value in the tuple last fetched from the qualification
**		    QEP (QEA_AGGF only).
**	    SMAIN   project the result tuple which include the aggregate
**		    result and the "by" values to the output row buffer. 
**		    This output row is different from the output row of
**		    ahd_current (QEA_AGGF). 
**		    Or, project by expressions and compute hash number from 
**		    their concatenated values (QEA_HAGGF).

**	    Drop qhd_rup, not used.
**      21-Sep-2010 (horda03) b124315
**          Normally each Action flows into the next action, chained together
**          by ahd_next. In a DBP though, an IF statement changes the flow, such
**          that the FALSE flow is in ahd_next but the TRUE flow is in
**          qhd_obj.qhd_if.ahd_true. When closing a DSH need to check ALL actions
**          so that CLOSE actions can be performed (as required), added ahd_list
**          to maintain the complete list of actions for the QP.
