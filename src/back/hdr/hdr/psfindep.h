/*
** Name: PSQ_OBJ - an element of a list of objects
**
** Description:
**	This structure defines an element of a list of objects; it consists of
**	object type, variable size list of object ids and a pointer to the next
**	element in the list.
**
** History:
**	11-sep-91 (andre)
**	    defined
**	04-oct-91 (andre)
**	    when processing GRANT ON PROCEDURE, I need a mechanism to mark an
**	    entry describing a dbproc owned by the current user as one of
**	    - an entry describing a grantable dbproc
**	    - an entry describing a nongrantable dbproc
**	      (knowing that a user cannot grant access on a certain dbproc can
**	      spare us the expense of reparsing it)
**	    - an entry marking beginning of the list of independent objects
**	      for a given dbproc
**	    - an entry marking a beginning of a list of object descriptors
**	      belonging to a dbproc which was deemed ungrantable (the list may
**	      still hold valuable information regarding dbprocs to which a user
**	      can/cannot grant access)
**	    psq_objtype which was originally intended to indicate whehter as
**	    given entry describes privileges on a dbproc or a table will be used
**	    for that purpose
**	10-oct-91 (andre)
**	    here is the problem: we have no RDF interface for obtaining dbproc
**	    information by dbpid abd dbpidx.  One solution would be to define
**	    the interface (this would require defining a new index on
**	    IIPROCEDURE.)
**	    However, given the time constraint introduced by my imminent
**	    departure, I will adopt a temporary solution: a DB_DBP_NAME
**	    structure will be added following the variable array of object ids.
**	    The idea is that for objects other than dbprocs, we will allocate
**	    memory necessary to accomodate the required number of IDs,
**	    overlaying all or part of the new structure member if necessary, but
**	    for dbprocs we will allocate the structure to accomodate one object
**	    id and the dbproc name (whetever you do, do not try to reference the
**	    dbproc name if !(psq_objtype & PSQ_OBJTYPE_IS_DBPROC))
**	26-mar-93 (andre)
**	    added psq_2id.  This will be used to contain secondary id of an
**	    independent object.  Initially, it will be used to contain integrity
**	    number of the independent UNIQUE/PRIMARY KEY constraint on which a
**	    REFERENCES constraint depends.  (at least for now) This new field
**	    will be meaningful only when
**	    (psq_objtype & PSQ_OBJTYPE_IS_CONSTRAINT)
