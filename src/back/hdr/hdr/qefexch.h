/**
**
** Name:  QEFEXCH.H   Typedefs for QEF parallel query processing.
**
** Description:
**
**	This file contains the control block that is used to preserve data
**	across calls to the exchange node during parallel processing.
**	After the exchange node launches children to handle query execution
**	of the outer tree branch, it returns so that other query processing
**	can continue. This block, stored in the DSH_CBS, allows the node
**	state to persist across calls.
**    
** History:
** 
**      9-feb-04 (toumi01)
**          Written.
**	8-apr-04 (toumi01)
**	    Add bool to track eating of first FUNC_RESET.
**	    Delete function and parent_thread as no longer needed.
**	28-apr-04 (toumi01)
**	    Add fields for 1:n parallelism.
**	19-may-04 (toumi01)
**	    Add debugging trace field for QE95.
**	02-Jun-2004 (jenjo02)
**	    Renamed CUT_BUFFER to CUT_RCB for clarity.
**	    Added cut_attached.
**	18-Aug-2004 (jenjo02)
**	    Implemented CUT DIRECT mode for Parent reads
**	    of DATA buffer.
**	09-Sep-2004 (jenjo02)
**	    Added cut_trace boolean, set with QE97.
**	    Deleted parent_cut_wait.
**	17-Sep-2004 (jenjo02)
**	    Change cut_attached from boolean to integer.
**	04-Apr-2006 (jenjo02)
**	    Moved BUFF_HDR, CHILD_DATA struture defines here
**	    from qenexch.c.
**	    Modified all structures to accomodate one CUT
**	    data buffer per child.
