** Name: DMRCB.H - Typedefs for DMF record access support.
**
** Description:
**      This file contains the control block used for all record 
**      operations.  Note, not all the fields of a control block
**      need to be set for every operation.  Refer to the Interface
**      Design Specification for inputs required for a specific
**      operation.

** Name: DMR_ATTR_ENTRY - Structure for qualifying attributes.
**
** Description:
**      This typedef defines the structure for each attribute array
**      entry provided as input in the record operation control 
**      block.  The array is used to describe all the attribute information
**      needed to qualify a record for retrieval.  Each entry contains the
**      ordinal number of an attribute, a pointer to an area containing the 
**      low value associated with this attribute, and a pointer to an area
**      containing the high value associated with this attribute.  If the
**      low pointer is null, then the minimum value is considered to be 
**      negative infinity.  If the high value is null, then the maximum
**      value is considered to be infinity.
**
**      Note:  Included structures are defined in DMF.H if they start
**      with DM_, otherwise they are defined as global DBMS types.
**
** History:
**    01-sep-85 (jennifer)

/*}
** Name:  DMR_CB - DMF record call control block.
**
** Description:
**      This typedef defines the control block required for the 
**      following DMF record operations:
**
**	DMR_ALTER - Alter record access characteristics.
**      DMR_DELETE - Delete a database table record.
**      DMR_GET - Get a database table record.
**	DMR_LOAD - Load rows into a regular or temporary table.
**      DMR_POSITION - Set scan criteria for a database table.
**      DMR_PUT - Put(insert) a database table record.
**      DMR_REPLACE - Replace(update) a database table record.
**	DMR_AGGREGATE - Execute simple aggregates, scanning any needed data.
**
**      The position table operation sets the starting and ending
**      record positions for a scan.  These positions are based on
**      input from the caller.  The entire table will be scanned
**      (i.e. the starting position is the beginning of the table and
**      the end position is the end of the table) if the flag indicating
**      all is set.  If the input flag indicates TID, then the starting and
**      ending postion will be set so that only the record specified by TID is 
**      available for selection.  In all other cases the positions
**      are calculated from the values provided in the attribute description
**      area of the call control block.  The positioning calculation
**      is as follows:
**
**      START POSITION:
**          The attribute values associated with keys are searched to find the
**          the key with the minimum value.  Once this is determined the
**          starting position is set to the first record having this key
**          value.  
**
**      END POSITION:
**          The attribute values associated with keys are searched to find the
**          key with the maximum value.  Once this is determined the ending 
**          position is set to the last record having this key value.
**
**      The positioning operation does not actually determine if there is a 
**      record which meets all the restrictions for all key and non key 
**      attributes.  If there is no record qualifying, this error will be 
**      returned on the get operation.
**
**      Note:  Included structures are defined in DMF.H if they start with
**      DM_, otherwise they are defined as global DBMS types.
**
** History:

**          Update to include standard header.
**      04-sep-86 (jennifer)

**          for the DMR_LOAD operation.

**          Added DMR_HEAPSORT, DMR_EMPTY flags for load
**	25-sep-87 (rogerk)
**	    Added dmr_s_estimated_records field.  This enables the optimizer to
**	    give an estimate of the number of tuples to be added in a LOAD
**	    sequence.  The sorter can then allocate large enough sort buffers to
**	    cut down on IO.
**	12-sep-88 (rogerk)
**	    Changed dmr_q_fcn and dmr_q_arg to be PTR's instead of i4s.
**	    This is to fix compile warnings in QEF.

**	    Added two new fields dmr_val_logkey and dmr_logkey to the DMR_CB

**	    the char array for additional information on how to build
**	    the table.

**          Bug #58635
**          Made l_reserved & owner elements PTR for consistency with DM_SVCB.
**	21-aug-1995 (cohmi01)
**	    Add new DMR_AGGREGATE request and related dmr_agg_xxxx flds for
**	    simple aggregate processing by  DMF.
**	30-jul-96 (nick)

**	    initialized. I could initialize it to get rid of the segv, then

**	23-jul-1998 (nanpr01)
**	    Added flag to enable positioning to read backwards.
**	01-oct-1998 (nanpr01)
**	    added attset to pass which attributes has been changed.
**      05-may-1999 (nanpr01,stial01)
**          Added DMR_DUP_ROLLBACK, set if duplicate will result in rollback
**          This allows DMF to dupcheck in indices after base table is updated.
**      1-Jul-2000 (wanfr01)
**        Bug 101521, INGSRV 1226 -  Add DMR_RAAT flag

**	    Add back-pointer to VALID struct to eliminate issues re searching
**	    for the master's valid list entry when opening partitions.
**	11-Apr-2008 (kschendel)
**	    Expand qual-function mechanism to be more directly suitable to
**	    calling ade-execute-cx, which is the normal case.
