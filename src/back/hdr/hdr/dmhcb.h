** Name: DMH_CB - DMF hash partition file operation control block.
**
** Description:
**      This typedef defines the control block required for
**      the following DMF hash partition file operations:
**
**      DMH_OPEN - Open/create a file.
**      DMH_CLOSE - Close/destroy a file.
**	DMH_WRITE - Write a block to a file.
**	DMH_READ - Read a block from a file.
**
** History:
**      9-apr-99 (inkdo01)
**          Written.
**	6-Jun-2005 (schka24)
**	    Embed the filename within the DMHCB so that parallel query
**	    child threads don't have to allocate their own filename areas.
**	6-Jul-2006 (kschendel)
**	    Comment update.
**	4-Mar-2007 (kschendel)  SIR 122512
**	    Add number-of-blocks for multiblock reads and writes.
**	    Get rid of dmh_numlocs, not used.  Make locidxp an i2 * since
**	    that's how it is used in qef.
