**
** Description:
**      This file contains all of the typedefs and defines necessary
**      to use any of the Query Storage Facility routines.  It depends
**      on the DBMS.H header file already being #included.
**
**      This file defines the following typedefs:
**	    QSF_CB	- QSF session control block.
**	    QSO_OBID	- Object id.
**	    QSF_RCB	- QSF request block.
**	    QSF_AEO	- An Associated External Object.
**			    This is an object, managed externally to QSF,
**			    which is associated with a QSF object.  The
**			    associations primary purpose, at this level, is to
**			    assure related destruction.
**
** History: 
**      12-mar-86 (thurston)
**          Initial creation.
**      18-mar-86 (thurston)
**	    Got rid of the QSO_OBNAME typedef by incorporating it into
**	    the QSO_OBID typedef.  Also, got rid of the .qsf_oblks member
**	    from the QSF_RCB typedef.

**	    the .qsf_feobj_id member to the request CB.
**	13-may-88 (thurston)
**	    Increased the size of .qso_name in the QSO_OBID structure, so that

** Name: QSO_OBID - Object id for a QSF object.
**
** Description:
**      This structure defines a QSF object id, which uniquely identifies an
**      object stored in QSF's memory.  It consists of an object name (optional)
**      and an object type.  Since the object id uniquely identifies an object
**      stored in QSF's memory, and the id consists of an object name and an
**      object type, there can be one object of each type with the same name.
**      This means that the query text, query tree, and query plan for a given
**      query can all share the same name but still be different QSF objects. 
**
**	Objects can be (and indeed very often are) un-named, in which
**	case the object "name" is just its handle, i.e. address.  Unnamed
**	objects are private to a session, and the session is responsible
**	for tracking and freeing unnamed objects.
**
**	When an object has a name, the name is of the form:
**	i4, i4			 |
**	DB_MAXNAME characters	-| actually part of a DB_CURSOR_ID
**	DB_MAXNAME more characters
**	another i4
**
**	Not all of this will be used (only the first lname chars).
**	There is a feeble attempt to structure-ize this name (see
**	later on), but in actuality it's hardwired in several places.
**
**	The QSF hash lookup algorithm depends on the fact that the
**	first DB_MAXNAME string will be the same in an ID's alias as
**	it is in the "real" object ID.  (I.e. the object ID and the
**	object's alias, if any, will hash to the same place.)
**
** History:
**	12-mar-86 (thurston)
**          Initial creation.
**	18-mar-86 (thurston)
**	    Incorporated the QSO_OBNAME typedef into this structure.  There
**	    was no real need for it, and by just using a char array here,
**	    it will be simpler to use.
**	18-mar-86 (thurston)
**	    Added the .qso_handle member.
**	12-may-86 (thurston)
**	    Added the .qso_lname member.
**	02-mar-87 (thurston)
**	    Added QSO_SQLDA_OBJ as another valid object type for QSF.
**	14-jan-88 (thurston)
**	    Added QSO_ALIAS_OBJ as another valid object type for QSF, along with
**	    some notes about it.
**	13-may-88 (thurston)
**	    Increased the size of .qso_name so that it can hold a db procedure
**	    name plus an owner name.
**	11-nov-88 (thurston)
**	    Increased the size of .qso_name so that it can hold a db procedure
**	    name plus an owner name, PLUS a unique database ID.
**	25-jan-89 (neil)
**	    Revised comment of QSO_ALIAS and .qso_name.  See QSO_NAME for a
**	    for new usage.
**	30-nov-1992 (rog)
**	    Added QSO_MASTER_OBJ object #define.
**	22-Feb-2005 (schka24)
**	    Remove same, updated comments.
