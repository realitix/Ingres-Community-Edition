/**
** Name: QEFCOPY.H - copy control blocks
**
** Description:
**	Description of control block used to sequence the COPY operation.
**	This block is filled in by PSF and then used by the Sequencer to
**	control the copy operation and sent to QEF to retrieve or append
**	rows. Described here is the mail QEU_COPY block as well as the
**	QEU_CPFILED which describes a copy file, and the QEU_CPDOMD
**	struct, which describes a copy file domain.

** Description :

**	mc_dv's db_data pointer will point at the actual data item

**	allocated from the same stream as the QEU_MISSING_COL structure;
**	we can get away with that because COPY doesn't really generate
**	query plans, there is no chance of sharing these things.
**	The data item is bit-copied into the row in the proper place.
**
**	If the default is a constant, the parser can set up the value
**	at parse time.  For non-constants, such as sequences, the
**	runtime has to set up the value.  For sequence defaults
**	specifically, the new sequence values are fetched at the
**	start of each row, and coerced into the missing-value data
**	item for the column.  The mc_seqdv member contains the sequence
**	datatype and pointer to the native sequence value for coercion.

** Name: QEU_COPY - copy control block

**      This control block contains the information necessary to perform

** History:

**          written
**     06-apr-87 (rogerk)
**	    added qeu_logname and qeu_maxerrs for new error handling features.

**          added qeu_load field which signifies to use load rather than puts.

**	25-Apr-2004 (schka24)
**	    Replace QEU_CB with pointer to copy control info.
**	25-oct-2009 (stephenb)
**	    Add fields for batch processing optimization.
**	19-Mar-2010 (kschendel) SIR 123448
**	    Delete unused fields, move "load" flag and tmptuple to QEU local.
**	25-Mar-2010 (kschendel) SIR 123485
**	    Forgot to delete qeu-moving-data, do that.  Comment updates.
**	    Add LOB couponify/redeem state variables formerly in sequencer
**	    session control block.
**	15-feb-2010 (toumi01) SIR 122403
**	    For encryption add qeu_tup_physical.
**	12-Apr-2010 (kschendel) SIR 123485
**	    Add base table access ID for COPY FROM, for use with blobs.
**	26-jun-2010 (stephenb)
**	    Add qeu_cbuf, qeu_cptr, qeu_csize, qeu_cleft, qeu_load_buf,
