/**
** Name: ULM.H - control block for ULF memory management routines
**
** Description:
**      This file contains the request control block to be used to make calls
**      to the "Utility Library Facility's Memory Management" routines (ULM).
**
** History: $Log-for RCS$
**      27-mar-86 (seputis)
**          initial creation
**	10-apr-86 (thurston)
**	    Changed the name of ULM_CB to ULM_RCB.  Also, many fields of the
**	    ULM_RCB added or modified.  Nothing terribly important.
**	17-jul-87 (thurston)
**	    Added ULM_SMARK, and extended ULM_RCB by adding .ulm_smark member.
**	28-aug-92 (rog)
**	    Prototype ULF.
**	15-oct-1993 (rog)
**	    Add prototype for ulm_copy().
**	19-nov-93 (swm)
**	    Bug #58637
**	    The ULM_SMARK type is treated as a ULM_I_SMARK internally by
**	    the ulf facility (by casting). Therefore, we must ensure that
**	    sizeof(ULM_SMARK) >= sizeof(ULM_I_SMARK). Since ULM_I_SMARK
**	    contains pointers (which are bigger than i4s on platforms
**	    such as axp_osf), change type of ulm_sbuf array elements from
**	    i4 to PTR.
**	12-may-1994 (rog)
**	    Add prototype for ulm_chunk_init().
**	11-Aug-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Added ulm_streamid_p which caller can supply to point to the
**	    address of a streamid. When the stream is deallocated, this
**	    address will be nullified by ULM.
**	15-Aug-1997 (jenjo02)
**	    Introduced the notion of private and shareable streams. Private streams
**	    are assumed to be thread-safe while shareable streams are not. It
**	    is the stream creator's responsibility to define this characteristic
**	    when the stream is created by ulm_openstream(). Shareable streams
**	    will be mutex-protected by ULM, private streams will not.
**	    To this end, added ulm_flags and defines to ULM_RCB.
**	    This change obviates the need for ulm_spalloc(), which has been removed.
**	    Also added a piggyback function to ulm_openstrem() by which one may
**	    allocate a piece of the stream during the same call by specifying the
**	    flag ULM_OPEN_AND_PALLOC.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	30-Jan-2004 (schka24)
**	    Add standard double-include protection
**      7-oct-2004 (thaju02)
**          Replace i4 with SIZE_TYPE for memory pool > 2Gig.
**      17-Jul-2206 (hanal04) Bug 116358
**          Prototype ulm_print_pool(). Quiets the compiler warnings in
**          QSF and QEF.
**	05-Nov-2010 (jonj) SIR 124685 Prototype Cleanup
**	    Add missing prototypes

** Name: ULM_RCB - request control block used to interface with ULM
**
** Description:
**      This control block is passed to each of the memory management routines.

**      and it is less error prone and moves less data if this information
**      is passed in a control block.
