** Name: QEU_LOGPART_CHAR - Logical Partition characteristics
**
** Description:
**	When defining a partitioned table (whether create or modify),
**	the partition distribution definition is in a DB_PART_DEF
**	structure.  For the physical creation of the partitions, though,
**	the DB_PART_DEF does not suffice, because there is no place to
**	put physical characteristics such as location, storage structure,
**	key columns, etc.  These physical things are all defined by
**	a WITH option clause within the partition definition.  As
**	such a WITH clause is parsed, QEU_LOGPART_CHAR entries are
**	created containing the WITH info for that partition or set of
**	partitions.  At execution time, as individual partitions are
**	created, the appropriate QEU_LOGPART_CHAR entry will be consulted
**	so that QEU can tell DMF how the partition should be structured.
**
**	Since there may be no partition WITH clauses, or very many, the
**	entries are in a list headed by qeu_logpart_list in the QEU_CB,
**	rather than being an array.
**
**	Note: for the initial implementation, the only physical
**	characteristics allowed will be LOCATION=.  The char_array
**	and key_array arrays will always be null.
**
**	For the CREATE TABLE AS SELECT situation, the QEU_CB does not
**	appear in the final query plan, because the qef/dmu operations
**	involved have to occur in the context of a multi-phase statement
**	instead of being standalone.  For CREATE TABLE AS SELECT, the
**	QEU_LOGPART_CHAR list is attached to the DMU action header.
**	(The parse still builds a QEU_CB but OPC doesn't bother
**	duplicating it.)
**
** History:
**	27-Jan-2004 (schka24)
**	    Written for partitioned tables project.
**	20-Feb-2004 (schka24)
**	    Initial name very poorly chosen, change.

/*
** Name: QEU_QUAL_PARAMS -- Qualification function parameter block
**
** Description:
**
**	When retrieving rows from some catalog for a QEU function, it's
**	allowed (indeed, encouraged) to pre-qualify the rows inside DMF
**	so that the QEU function doesn't have to look at unnecessary rows.
**	Essentially, we want to tap into the DMF row-qualification feature.
**
**	DMF row qualification is designed for qualifying ordinary queries,
**	and includes some extra "stuff" that doesn't need to be exposed
**	for QEU level qualification.  So, this parameter block has been
**	defined to simplify things for the QEU user.
**
**	The QEU user will generally define the qual-params block on the
**	stack (or somewhere else safe), and fill in any needed params
**	for the called function.  The called function is invoked with:
**
**	    db_status = (*function)(&adf_cb, &qual_params);
**
**	where the ADF cb belongs to DMF and can usually be ignored, and
**	the qual_params block can contain up to 4 pointers to "stuff" that
**	the called function can use.  The called function should set
**	qual_params.qeu_retval to ADE_TRUE if the row qualifies, and
**	to ADE_NOT_TRUE if it doesn't.
**
** History:
**
**	11-Apr-2008 (kschendel)
**	    Spiff up DMF qualification, define this for qeu.

**	    added qeu_mask, qeu_timeout, qeu_maxlocks to support
**	    the OPF ACTIVE flag
**	19-may-92 (bonobo)
**	    Eliminated redundant typedef.
**	22-jun-92 (andre)
**	    defined qeu_f_qual, qeu_f_qarg, QEU_F_NEXT and QEU_F_RETURN
**	08-sep-92 (andre)

**	    defined qeu_ddl_info and qeu_qtext
**	11-feb-93 (andre)
**	    defined QEU_DROP_BASE_TBL_ONLY over qeu_flag; this mask will be used
**	    to indicate that only the specified base table is to be dropped
**	    (i.e. no attempt will be made to look up and destroy objects
**	    dependent on the specified base table); this bit will be honored
**	    when dropping BASE base tables (later it may be extended to STAR
**	    tables as well, but there is no need to do it now)
**	08-jun-93 (rblumer)
**	    defined QEU_WANT_USER_XACT flag; used by PSF when it wants a query
**	    to be run as part of a user transaction instead of the internal
**	    transaction that is sometimes used for parsing and compiling.
**	    To be used as part of the kluge verifying that constraints hold on
**	    existing data (during ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT).

**	11-feb-99 (stephenb)
**	    Add tran_id field so that we can return tran id to SCF.
**	27-Jan-2004 (schka24)
**	    Added partitioning info pointer.
