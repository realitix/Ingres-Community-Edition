/**
** Name: QEFCB.H - The QEF control block 
** 
**
** Description:
**      The QEF control block is used to initiate all communication
**  with the Query Execution Facility. All session specific information
**  is provided through this mechanism. It is assumed that anyone wanting
**  QEF information or service can gain access to the proper control block
**  for the session and pass it to QEF.
**
** History: $Log-for RCS$
**      19-mar-86 (daved)
**          written
**	11-jan-88 (puree)
**	    change QEF special savepoint name to lower case.
**	03-aug-88 (puree)
**	    add define for QEF_RO_MSTRAN.
**	24-aug-88 (puree)
**	    add define for QEF_RO_SSTRAN.
**	26-sep-88 (puree)
**	    modified QEF_CB to support QEF in-memory sorter.
**	23-dec-88 (carl)
**	    modified QES_QRY_SES to support Titan's hold-and-execute strategy
**	15-jan-89 (paul)
**	    add support for rules. qef_dsh is now the top of stack pointer
**	    for the DSH stack.
**	08-Mar-89 (ac)
**	    add 2PC support.
**	30-mar-89 (paul)
**	    Added session query cost limits for resource control.
**	    Also added qef_max_stack to allow maximum procedure nesting
**	    depth to be set dynamically.
**	07-apr-89 (carl)
**	    added define QES_4ST_REFRESH to flag a REGISTER WITH REFRESH command
**	12-apr-89 (ralph)
**	    Changed qef_fl_dbpriv to u_i4
**	22-may-89 (carl)
**	    added QES_RPT_HANDLE structure
**	23-may-89 (carl)
**	    added QES_03CTL_READING_TUPLES for QES_DDB_SES
**	05-jul-89 (carl)
**	    added qef_c3_streamid and qef_c4_streamsize for allocating 
**	    dedicated stream for a session's use
**	27-oct-89 (ralph)
**	    Added qef_user and qef_ustat to QEF_CB.
**	03-jun-90 (carl)
**	    added defines for STAR trace points qe50, qe51
**	04-aug-90 (carl)
**	    added:
**		1) define for STAR trace point qe55, 
**		2) define QES_04CTL_OK_TO_OUTPUT_QP to QES_DDB_SES to avoid 
**		   writing the current QP info to the log multiple times,
**		3) define QES_05CTL_SYSCAT_USER to QES_DDB_SES to indicate 
**		   that the session is a system user
**	21-aug-90 (carl)
**	    1)  added defines for STAR trace points:
**              qe40 for tracing every QEF operation,
**              qe50 for skipping destroying temporary tables at the end of
**              every DDB query,
**              qe51 for validating DDB QPs,
**              qe55 for tracing queries including their text,
**              qe56 for tracing DDL commands,
**              qe57 for tracing stream allocation and deallocation,
**              qe56 for tracing QEF calls,
**              qe59 for tracing queries in error situations
**	    2)  added memory operation defines:
**		QEF_MEM0_NIL, QEF_MEM1_AFT_OPEN, QEF_MEM2_AFT_CLOSE,
**		QEF_MEM3_AFT_ALLOC
**	05-oct-90 (davebf)
**	    Added qef_ostat, qef_tran_seq
**	25-feb-91 (rogerk)
**	    Added qef_stm_error to the qef_cb to specify transaction error
**	    handling actions for the session.  Added qef_savepoint to the
**	    qef_cb to hold user savepoint name for statement aborts.
**	    These were added as part of the SET SESSION WITH ON_ERROR changes.
**	    Added comments on the use of the Per-Statement Savepoint name.
**	11-mar-92 (jhahn)
**	    Added support for QEF interrupts.
**	    Added qef_user_interrupt, qef_user_interrupt_handled to qef_cb.
**	    Added QEF_CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPT macro.
**      26-jun-92 (anitap)
**          Added support for backward compatibility for update rowcount.
**      14-jul-92 (fpang)
**	    Fixed compiler warnings, QES_RPT_HANDLE.
**	17-mar-93 (rickh)
**	    Added field to qef_cb to describe case translation semantics.
**	07-apr-93 (ralph)
**	    DELIM_IDENT:
**	    Added qef_dbxlate to QEF_CB, which points to case translation mask.
**	    Added qef_cat_own to QEF_CB, which points to catalog owner name.
**	2-aug-93 (rickh)
**	    Removed 17-mar-93 case translation field, which was superceded by
**	    7-apr-93 field.  Replaced the removed field with
**	    qef_callbackStatus.  This new field is used to preserve context
**	    over nested qef_calls.  For instance, during the creation of
**	    a CONSTRAINT, qef cooks up text (like "create index"), which
**	    psf parses and then callsback qef to execute.  It's useful to
**	    remember some simple facts across these callbacks.  Again for
**	    example, if we're in the middle of creating a UNIQUE CONSTRAINT
**	    and qef has called itself back to cook up an index, it's useful
**	    for the nexted index-creation to know that it's operating in
**	    the context of a "create constraint" so it can handle errors
**	    differently.  Simple.
**      10-sep-93 (smc)
**          Made qef_ses_id a CS_SID.
**	9-aug-93 (rickh)
**	    Added another flag to qef_callbackStatus.  This flags whether
**	    a SELECT ANY( 1 ) statement returned 1 or 0.  The REFERENTIAL
**	    CONSTRAINT state machine issues a SELECT statement verifying
**	    whether the constraint holds.  This new flag allows that SELECT
**	    to tell the next REFERENTIAL state whether the SELECT succeeded.
**	    If it didn't, we roll back the ADD CONSTRAINT DDL and don't bother
**	    cooking up all the tiresome objects which support a REFERENTIAL
**	    CONSTRAINT.
**	25-aug-93 (anitap)
**	    Added another flag to qef_callbackStatus in QEF_CB. This flags 
**	    whether a SELECT ANY(1) statement has to be executed by QEF after 
**	    the query text for the statement has gone through execute immediate
**	    parsing.
**	20-jan-94 (rickh)
**	    Added field to QEF_CB to hold the spill threshold for QEN hold
**	    files.  So far, this is only used for testing the spill logic.
**	14-mar-94 (swm)
**	    Bug #59883
**	    Added qef_trfmt buffer pointer and qef_trsize, QEF_TRFMT_SIZE
**	    definitions to QEF_CB. This is to enable the allocation of a
**	    TRformat buffer per QEF session rather than relying on automatic
**	    (TRformat) buffer allocation on the stack to eliminate the
**	    probability of stack overrun owing to large buffers.
**	 13-aug-2002(stial01 for angusm)
**	    Add trace point qe40 (QEF_XAFABORT) for XA transaction force-abort.
**      28-feb-2003 (stial01)
**          Added qef-ulm memory diagnostics (set trace point qe41 #)
**	8-apr-04 (inkdo01)
**	    Removed QEF_CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPT macro (moved to qef!hdr!qefdsh.h).
**      12-Apr-2004 (stial01)
**          Define qef_length as SIZE_TYPE.
**      28-dec-2004 (huazh01)
**          Add trace point qe61, which allows user to modify table/index
**          with constraint dependency.
**          INGSRV3004, b112978.
**      10-Jul-2006 (hanal04) Bug 116358
**          Added QEF_TRACE_IMMEDIATE_ULM_POOLMAP option to trace point qe41.
**	02-Jun-2009 (hanje04)
**	    Change qef_auto in QEF_CB to be i4 rather than bool, to match
**	    the same field in QEF_RCB. The miss-match causes problems on OSX
**	    because it stores values of 1 & 2

**	    a SELECT ANY( 1 ) statement returned 1 or 0.  The REFERENTIAL
**	    CONSTRAINT state machine issues a SELECT statement verifying
**	    whether the constraint holds.  This new flag allows that SELECT
**	    to tell the next REFERENTIAL state whether the SELECT succeeded.
**	    If it didn't, we roll back the ADD CONSTRAINT DDL and don't bother
**	    cooking up all the tiresome objects which support a REFERENTIAL
**	    CONSTRAINT.
**	25-aug-93 (anitap)
**	    Added another flag to qef_callbackStatus. This flags whether a
**	    SELECT ANY(1) statement has to be executed by QEF after the 
**	    query text for the statement has gone through execute immediate
**	    parsing.
**	22-sep-93 (andre)
**	    added qef_sess_flags and defined QEF_RUNNING_UPGRADEDB
**	05-nov-1993 (smc)
**          Bug #58635
**          Made l_reserved & owner elements PTR for consistency with DM_SVCB.
**	24-nov-93 (robf)
**          Add qef_group, qef_aplid to allow security alarms by group/role.
**	20-jan-94 (rickh)
**	    Added field to QEF_CB to hold the spill threshold for QEN hold
**	    files.  So far, this is only used for testing the spill logic.
**	14-mar-94 (swm)
**	    Bug #59883
**	    Added qef_trfmt buffer pointer and qef_trsize, QEF_TRFMT_SIZE
**	    definitions to QEF_CB. This is to enable the allocation of a
**	    TRformat buffer per QEF session rather than relying on automatic
**	    (TRformat) buffer allocation on the stack to eliminate the
**	    probability of stack overrun owing to large buffers.
**	28-jan-00 (inkdo01)
**	    Added qef_h_max & qef_h_used to define max hash join memory per query.
**	28-Jul-2006 (jonj)
**	    Added qef_error_errorno, qef_error_qef_code, set by qef_error(),
**	    used by the sequencer to figure out XA return codes.
**	4-oct-2006 (dougi)
**	    Enlarged qef_debug to accommodate Karl's tp.
**	14-april-2009 (dougi)
**	    Added X100_STRUCT trace point (qe80) to make tables default to
**	    X100.
**	4-Jun-2009 (kschendel) b122118
**	    Add QE11 trace point (for the nth time, I keep losing it!)
**	    Add QE89 hash debug trace point.
**	24-Sep-09 (smeke01) b122635
**	    Add trace point QE71 to enable/disable diagnostic function 
**	    qen_exchange_serial(). 
**	28-Jun-2010 (smeke01) b123969
**	    Added diagnostic tracepoint QE72 which facilitates the setting
**	    of partition size and number of partitions respectively for hash
**	    join. 
**	13-Sep-2010 (kschendel) Bug 123720
**	    Add qef_trsem for valid parallel-query output.
**	27-apr-2010 (dougi)
**	    Add tp qe83 to enable IVW join index creation.
**	25-aug-2010 (dougi)
**	    Add qef_ivwsesscb for VectorWise session mgmt.
**	27-aug-2010 (dougi)
**	    Add qef_dba for VectorWise combine auth checking.
**	22-Sep-2010 (kschendel)
**	    Re-type ivwsesscb for minor clarity improvement.
**	28-sep-2010 (dougi)
**	    Add qe84 to replace qe83.
