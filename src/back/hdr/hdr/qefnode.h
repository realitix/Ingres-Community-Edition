/**
** Name: QEFNODE.H - Describe the nodes of a Query Execution Plan (QEP)
**
** Description:
**      A QEP is composed of one or more nodes describing some set of
**  required actions. The node types are
**  QEN_TJOIN   - tid join
**  QEN_KJOIN   - key probe join
**  QEN_SJOIN   - full sort/merge, inner_sorted, and cart_prod joins
**  QEN_HJOIN   - hash join
**  QEN_SEJOIN	- perform a join where inner is QEN_QP and executing
**		  a subselect
**  QEN_SORT    - initiate a sort
**  QEN_TSORT   - top sort node - load sorter and retrieve rows
**  QEN_ORIG    - get a row from a relation or sort file
**  QEN_QP      - get a row from a query plan
**  QEN_EXCH	- exchange rows between different threads executing
**		  the same plan
**  QEN_TPROC	- call table procedure in query plan
**  
**
** History:
**      19-mar-86 (daved)
**          written
**      7-apr-86 (daved)
**          references to sub nodes are now pointers to facilitate
**          argument passing. The use of pointers is OK in this instance
**          because they are not data dependent. Initialization
**          requires that the postfix notation be converted to pointers.

/*
** Partition Qualification - overview
**
**	Partition qualification (a.k.a. partition elimination or
**	partition pruning) is relatively complicated, since its
**	effects can reach across the query plan.
**
**	The fundamental operation in partition qualification is to
**	generate a partitioning-scheme value (ie one or more column
**	values at scheme-defined offsets), and apply a "which partition"
**	operation to the value.  The returned partition number is
**	used to set (or clear!) one or more bits in a logical
**	partition bitmap, which can in turn be translated into a
**	physical partition bitmap.  The physical partition bitmap
**	is used by an ORIG (or ORIG-like node, e.g. kjoin inner)
**	to decide which partitions to read (or probe) and which to skip.
**
**	Partition qualification can take place either at query
**	startup (for constant qualifications) or at runtime (for
**	join-time qualifications).  A simple qualification like:
**
**	    ... where t.part_col = 1 and ...
**
**	can obviously be evaluated at query startup and applied to
**	the relevant ORIG node.  Complex conditions are dealt with by
**	setting bits based on the comparison operation (e.g. >=, <=)
**	into work maps and AND'ing or OR'ing with the result:
**
**	    ... where t.dim1_col = 1
**		    and (t.dim2_col = 5 or t.dim2_col between 10 and 20) ...
**
**	would be done with something like:
**		EVAL dim1 1 INTO result_map
**		EVAL dim2 5 INTO work_map #2
**		EVAL dim2 >=10 INTO work_map #3
**		EVAL dim2 <=20 INTO work_map #4
**		AND work_map #4 INTO work_map #3
**		OR work_map #3 INTO work_map #2
**		AND work_map #2 INTO result_map
**
**	obviously there are various ways of encoding the condition, but
**	the idea is to use a mini-program that can perform the basic
**	operations on the physical partition bitmaps.  The value
**	expressions are materialized using a CX;  in these examples, it's
**	just moving a constant to the right place, but it could be a
**	lot fancier.  (Actually, one CX lays down all the necessary
**	constants or expression results into a row, end-to-end;  this
**	takes more row space, but a CX is a sufficiently clumsy animal
**	that one big CX easily wins over many little ones.)
**
**	Join-time qualification is trickier, but can have major benefits
**	in some particular situations.  There are a couple different
**	cases here:  K-join qualification and merge/hash join qualification.
**
**	K-join inners can be qualified with constant predicates just
**	like ordinary orig nodes.  The only difference so far is that
**	there isn't an actual orig for the K-join inner, so the necessary
**	data structures have to be attached to the K-join node.
**	However, if the join predicates involve partitioned columns,
**	we can apply the qualification process as each outer row appears;
**	thus probing only the qualifying partitions of the inner rather
**	than every single partition.  Note that the relevant predicates need
**	not involve key columns;  consider
**
**	    ... where l1.c1 = t.key_col
**		    and t.dim_col between l2.lower and l2.upper ...
**
**	where l1 and l2 are tables on the outer side of the K-join.
**	It's perfectly possible to build a qualification bitmap from
**	each outer row, using the between predicate.
**
**	The final possibility for qualification is when the partitioned
**	table is somewhere below the inner side of a hash join or
**	FSM-join.  (The latter must involve an explicit outer sort for
**	this to work.)  The idea here is that *ALL* rows of the outer
**	are collected before fetching *ANY* rows of the inner.  (Either
**	for the hash table build, or for the outer sort which is done
**	before the inner sort.)  Thus, we can generate a qualification
**	bitmap from each outer row in the same manner as we do for
**	K-joins;  except, instead of applying it immediately, we OR
**	all the bitmaps together, and then AND that result into the
**	orig qualification bitmap below the inner of the join.
**	Note that this works even if the partitioned inner is way down
**	underneath somewhere;  it doesn't have to be immediately below
**	the hash/merge join!  Also, more than one join along the way
**	can contribute to pruning the ultimate bitmap.
**
**	An important optimization for this case is to recognize when
**	the join is no longer restricting the partitioning (i.e. the
**	bitmap has become all ones);  if this happens, we stop doing all
**	the laborious partitioning value calculations and just let
**	the join rip.  A related optimization occurs when some other
**	completed qualification has already restricted the table down
**	to something "small" (e.g. one partition);  we can turn off
**	the join-time qualifications at that point, since we're unlikely
**	to be able to improve things.
**
**	In the FSM join case, we actually attach the partition
**	qualification junk to the outer's TSORT node rather than
**	to the FSM-join node itself.  The TSORT is the collection
**	point for the outers, and it's easier to build up the
**	qualifier bitmaps there (on the way into the sort, as a
**	matter of fact).  For the hash join case, the partition
**	qualification stuff can attach to the HJOIN node, since
**	the hash join is going to read the entire outer first
**	and it can build the bitmaps as it goes.
**
**	FSM/hash joins that are already partition-compatible do not
**	do join time qualification.  PC-joins already proceed
**	partition by partition, so in the usual 1:1 case there's no
**	point doing all that work when we know what inner partition
**	we're reading anyway.  (Hash-partitioned tables can do a
**	1:N PC-join, but N is usually a very small number and it's
**	still not worth it.)
**
**	Outer joins complicate the picture, but only to the extent that
**	the optimizer has to recognize non-restricting ON qualifications
**	and not do partition restriction;  it's the optimizer's problem.
**
**	As a side note:  partition qualification might seem a little
**	bit like keying, but the big difference is that it's practical
**	to represent the qualification result in a bit-map (i.e. as a
**	physical partition map).  The predicate evaluation with any
**	ANDs and ORs can be simplistic or redundant, as long as it ends
**	up setting the right bits.  Keying can't produce a which-row
**	bitmap (and it would be impractical even if it could), so
**	keying has to get resolved into non-overlapping range lookups.
**	The non-overlapping requirement for keying causes all sorts of
**	other restrictions that don't apply to partition qualification.
**	So, while it was superficially tempting to try to share
**	mechanisms between the two, they ended up being entirely separate.

/*
** Name: QEN_PART_QUAL - QP information for partition qualification
**
** Description:
**
**	This structure defines the information needed to do partition
**	qualification.  It may exist as part of an orig;  a K-join
**	or T-join(*) node;  or a FSM or hash join node.
**
**	(*) qualifying against a T-join node isn't currently implemented.
**	There's nothing wrong with the idea;  it would eliminate base
**	table reads for tids that point to non-qualifying partitions.
**	I just haven't gotten around to doing the code yet.  FIXME.
**
**	The info needed for FSM/hash join nodes is slightly different
**	than what we need for origs or K-join inners, but splitting
**	it up into two structs would only save a dozen or so bytes per
**	node;  so I haven't bothered.  I will note which members are
**	used for which kinds of nodes.  Structure members that aren't
**	used in some context (such as the constant-qual-map index in a
**	hash-join node context) are indeterminate and must not be
**	used for anything.
**
**	Shorthand:  PP = physical partition, LP = logical partition.
**
**	The QEN_PART_QUAL contains:
**	- A copy of the node qen_type (e.g. QE_ORIG, QE_HJOIN, etc).
**	This could be useful for doing generic processing of a qual
**	struct, to know what is filled in and what isn't.  [all]
**
**	- An index into the dsh_part_qual array of QEE_PART_QUAL
**	structures, which hold runtime info related specifically to this
**	particular execution of this qualification.  [all]
**
**	- A pointer to the QEN_PQ_EVAL directives that compute the
**	qualifying bitmap for constant predicates.  The result AND's
**	into the constant-qual-map below.  [orig, K/T-join]
**
**	- A pointer to the QEN_PQ_EVAL directives that compute the
**	qualifying bitmap for joining predicates.  The result OR's
**	into the local-result map.  [K/T-join, fsm/hash joins]
**	(We need two separate sets of directives thanks to the lack of
**	a real ORIG for K/T-join inners.)
**
**	- A pointer to the next QEN_PART_QUAL that needs to be evaluated
**	at this join node.  [fsm/hash joins]
**
**	- The DSH row number for a constant-qualification bitmap.
**	This PP bitmap starts out as all ones, and is AND'ed with the
**	qualification results from any constant qualifications.
**	This is done just once, at execution-time setup.
**	[orig, K/T-join]
**
**	- The DSH row number for the local-result map row, a pp map row.
**	For FSM/hash joins, this is where we accumulate (via OR) the
**	qualifying partitions resulting from all the outers (starting
**	out from zero at a node reset).
**	For K/T joins, the same idea, except that we reset lresult to zero
**	for each outer.  So, local-result is qualifying partitions for
**	this outer row.
**	For ORIG and K/T joins, this bitmap eventually holds the final
**	qualifying partition map:  the AND of the row local-result
**	(K/T joins), all higher-up qualification maps, and the constant
**	bitmap.
**	Note: for ORIG, this local-result bitmap ignores the effects
**	of PC-join grouping.  PC-join grouping is dealt with independently
**	inside the ORIG.  (K/T-joins don't PC-join.)
**	[all]
**
**	- A pointer to the orig node for which we're gathering the
**	qualifications.  As a convenience, for orig-like things (orig,
**	K-join, T-join), this will be a "pointer to self".  [all]
**
**	- A pointer to the DB_PART_DEF partition definition, with at least
**	the dimensions used for qualification (at this node and elsewhere)
**	filled in.  [orig, K/T-join]
**
**	- The DSH row number for a bitmap work row, used for LP -> PP
**	conversion.  This row can be omitted (left as -1) if the table
**	only has a single partitioning dimension, since in that case
**	logical and physical partitioning is the same.  Since this is
**	a strictly temporary-use thing, it's only listed in the orig-like
**	node, but all related quals use the same temp row.  [orig, K/T-join]
**
** History:
**	23-Jul-2007 (kschendel)
**	    Completely revise partition qualification for generalized
**	    qualification, join-time qualification.

/* Some notes about the relop definitions:
** - the main reason for the multi-value capability is to handle IN-lists
**   more efficiently.  An IN-list could be done with a long series of OR'ed
**   individual PQE_EVAL_VALUE operations, but that would make the
**   directives longer and more tedious.
**   The multi-value capability is also useful for multi-column (composite)
**   dimensions, as it makes the OPC code a lot simpler.  (In that situation,
**   the OR's are not so apparent since they're splattered across multiple
**   boolean factors for the different columns.  Ugh.)
** - NE is *only* allowed for list partitioning, as that is the only case
**   where we can reasonably expect that no other values share the partition.
** - LE and GE are not usable with hash partitioning.
** - There is no LT or GT, just LE and GE.  The reason is that the only way
**   you could actually do an LT or GT would be to hit the exact break
**   value;  otherwise you have to include the "eq" partition anyway.
** - NOT is currently unused, because not'ing a value set is different
**   from not'ing a physical partition set in most cases.  In other
**   words, just because col=value selects say partition 21 doesn't mean
**   that NOT col=value selects all-but-21;  other rows in 21 might have
**   col != value.  Fortunately, explicit NOT's in boolean factors are
**   rare, they are usually removed by the CNF transform.

** Name: QEN_PART_INFO	- orig information on partitioned tables
**

**	This descriptor contains information necessary to execute
**	KJOIN, ORIG and TJOIN nodes involving partitioned tables.
**
**	Apart from partition qualification, which we've already taken
**	care of (above), what we need here mostly applies to information
**	needed for orig's that feed into partitioning compatible joining.
**	(PC-join orig's.)  For now, we can only PC-join along one
**	dimension.
**
**	For PC joining, we need partition dimension info and a group
**	count, indicating how many logical partitions should be
**	returned before indicating end-of-group.  For details see
**	qenorig.c.
**
**	For K/T-joins, we keep a couple of extra bitmaps around, since
**	these operations look like both orig's and joins to some extent.
**	(Here we're talking about partition qualification on the inner,
**	which is necessarily a table and not a sub-plan like other joins.)
**	One bitmap holds the intersection (AND) of the constant map and
**	all higher-up join contributions, since that AND is constant for
**	the life of the join.  Another bitmap holds a map of partitions
**	that did not contain the specified key;  if the next outer
**	produces the same key, we can mask off those partitions from
**	consideration.

** Name: QEN_SJOIN  - Join info for QE_FSMJOIN, QE_ISJOIN, and QE_CPJOIN nodes

** Description:								       
**	This structure is used for the nodes QE_FSMJOIN (full sort merge),     
**	QE_ISJOIN (inner sort join), and QE_CPJOIN (cart-prod join).	       
**	The full sort merge join assumes that the data coming from both	       
**	the inner and outer nodes is sorted. The inner sort join assumes       
**	that the data from the inner node is sorted (not that the inner node   
**	is a sort node), and that the outer is not sorted. Finally, the	       
**	cart-prod join assumes that the data from neither the inner nor the    
**	outer is sorted. These assumptions about the sortedness of data	       
**	are used to minimize the number of tuple fetches and comparisons.      
**									       
**	The QE_ISJOIN and QE_CPJOIN nodes will need to rescan the data from    
**	the inner node. Sometimes it is more efficient to store the inner data 
**	in a hold file and rescan this data. Other times is is more efficient  
**	to simply rescan the inner node directly. The optimizer will make

**									       
**	The QE_FSMJOIN will never rescan the inner data from the beginning.    
**	Instead, a full sort merge will, at times, rescan small portions of    
**	of the inner data. Since the inner node is only able to reset itself

** Name: QEN_KJOIN - keyed lookup on inner node
**
** Description:
**      The outer node generates a set of attributes that can
**  be used to key the inner relation. For each outer tuple, the
**  inner relation is accessed for tuples that match the joining attributes
**  and satisfy applicable qualifications.
**
**	In the keyed join, the outer tuple is set by calling the proper
**  function on the kjoin_out node. Kjoin_key produces the attributes in the
**  join that can facilitate access of the inner relation. These attributes
**  are materialized into a row buffer stored in a row buffer, the row
**  buffer number is the one used in the output slot of the ADE param in
**  kjoin_key. This row buffer is also used by kjoin_get. Once the keys
**  are materialized, kjoin_get is used to access the inner relation and
**  generate joined tuples. kjoin_jqual is used to further qualify the tuple.
**  
**  Kjoin_kys specifies the keys (attribute number, operator (<,>,=,etc),
**  and offset within key row buffer. 
**
**  Kjoin_kuniq is used to limit scans of the inner relation. If this field
**  is set (TRUE), then for a unique outer, only one inner tuple will be
**  found. Thus, kuniq should only be set if doing an equality join.
**  Kjoin_kcompare is used to compare the current key values to the
**  previous key values. This is needed so that we can tell if the next join
**  value is the same as the current join value.
**
**  NOTE on qualifying tuple. If a tid is in the qualification, coming from
**  the inner relation, kjoin_tqual must be set, else cleared. If it is set,
**  kjoin will qualify the tuple, else DMF will qualify the tuple. In the latter
**  case, the tuple begin qualified will be a QEN_DMF_ALLOC in the 
**  qualification's QEN_ADF struct. As such, the qen_input field of the
**  qualification's QEN_ADF struct will need to be initialized with the
**  base number of the QEN_DMF_ALLOC row.

** Name: QEN_TJOIN - Perform a tid lookup into the inner node
**
** Description:
**   An outer row value is positioned by calling the function that
**  will produce the outer row. The node CB for the outer tuple is in
**  tjoin_out. Tjoin_get is an index into the DSH->DSH_CBS that refers
**  to a positioned DMR_CB. tjoin_key contains the structures necessary
**  to materialize the tid into the DMR_CB in tjoin_get so that the
**  inner row can be fetched. tjoin_jqual is used to qualify
**  the joined rows. Rows are retrieved from the outer and inner until
**  a qualified row is found.

** Name: QEN_SEJOIN  - select join node
**
** Description:
**	This join node is used when performing a subselect join. The inner
**  node must always be a QEN_QP node. When called, this node will get
**  an outer row and try to satisfy the qualification according to the
**  semantics of the select type {all or blank}. If all, then the inner
**  will be scanned and must reach EOF to succeed. If blank, then, if another
**  inner can be found, an error condition exists.
**
**  QEN_JUNC (junction type)
**	QESE1_CONT_AND
**	    The inner AND outer values must be TRUE before returning success.
**	    If either the inner or the outer fail then CONTinue processing
**	    with the next outer until there are no more outer rows.
**
**	QESE2_CONT_OR
**	    Like above, the inner OR outer values must be true before 
**	    returning success.  If the outer is TRUE, return success.  If
**	    the outer value fails but the inner is TRUE, return success.
**	    If both the outer and inner fail, the CONTinue processing with
**	    the next outer unless a ZERO_ONE error was generated.  In this 
**	    case, all processing should stop.
**
**	QESE3_RETURN_OR
**	    The inner OR outer values must be TRUE before returning success.
**	    If the outer is TRUE, return success.  If the outer fails but the
**	    inner value is TRUE, return success.  If both the outer and the
**	    inner fail, then return the worse error.  Notice: ZERO_ONE error
**	    is worse than NOT_ALL.
**
**	QESE4_RETURN_AND
**	    Like above, both the inner AND outer values must be TRUE before
**	    returning sucess.  However, if either the inner or the outer
**	    fails then return the error instead of continuing with the
**	    next outer.

** Name: QEN_ORIG - The origination node
**
** Description:
**	Zero or more keys are used to access a base relation and 
**  originate tuples into the QEP stream. If there are no keys, the
**  relation is scanned. Keys are used to limit the scan of the relation.
**
**  NOTE: The use of keys can often get tricky. Take for example, r.tid =
**	s.a + 3. If 'r' is the inner, there will be a TJOIN node performing
**	the join. The TJOIN node needs to read the tid (s.a + 3) from the
**	orig row buffer. DMF will currently use the user's row buffer
**	to qualify tuples (because some rows are compressed). In this case,
**	the qualification CX struct should also contain code to produce
**	the tid value. For non-TJOIN types of joins, CX structs exist to
**	produce all function values.
**  
**  Note on qualifying tuples:
**	In retrieves where the tid is not involved in the qualification,
**	use the QEN_DMF_ALLOC field in the QEN_BASE for qualifying the tuple.
**	If a tid is used in the qual, QEN_ORIG will move the tid into the
**	this node's row buffer and qualify the tuple. Thus, the ADF_QUAL
**	should use the QEN_ROW field in the QEN_BASE to mark the incoming
**	row (instead of QEN_DMF_ALLOC). 
**
**  Note, if the tid is used for lookup (a key) qen_ukey must be set.

/*}
** Name: QEF_KEY - describe the key structure
**
** Description:
**
**  The QEF_KEY structure and its subordinates describe keying into some
**  keyed relation.  It is designed to deal with various situations like
**  partial keys, multiple keys, multi-part keys, and parameterized
**  queries (repeat or DBP parameters as key values).  Ultimately, the
**  keying structures result in <attribute,value,positioning operator>
**  elements being passed to DMF in a DMR_CB control block.
**      
**      A key for a node is a moderately complicated structure. A key can
**  be one of four types, equality, minimum, maximum or range.
**  For example: r.a = 65, r.a < 65, r.a > 65, or (r.a >65 and r.a < 75).
**  There can also be multiple values for any key (r.a=65 or r.a=75) or
**  (r.a < 65 and r.a < 75).  While OPF goes to considerable lengths to
**  analyze the keying and eliminate dups and overlaps, there may still be
**  situations where the proper key values and key ordering are left to
**  be decided at runtime.
**
**  Most if not all of the discussion that follows applies to keying for
**  ORIG nodes.  K-join nodes use QEF_KEY structures, but in a minimal
**  way:  only the equality conditions are described, and the only thing
**  that QEF does with K-join keying info is use it to allocate DMF
**  position-bound descriptors (DMR_ATTR_ENTRY's).
**
**  Depending on circumstances, given a one-sided inequality such as
**  r.a > 10, the optimizer may decide to compile a range with one end
**  at infinity.  (r.a >= 10 AND r.a <= +infinity).  LIKE pattern
**  matching with a fixed prefix (str LIKE 'tw%') can also end up
**  looking like a range key.
**
**  The key structure has the following appearance:
**
**	QEF_KEY (top of structure)
**	    |
**	QEF_KOR (first set of keys) - QEF_KAND (first keyed att) - QEF_KAND
**	    |			     (min, max, or eq)
**	    |				|
**	QEF_KOR			      QEF_KATT (attribute desc)
**	    |				|
**	    |			      QEF_KATT
**	QEF_KOR (third set of keys)
**
**  Thus the key structure is in "disjunctive normal form", OR's of AND's.
**  
**  The QEF_KEY represents the set of keys for one orig or join node,
**  and is basically the header.  It does very little and we could probably
**  get rid of it if we tried.
**
**  Each QEF_KOR is in essence one key lookup, ie a key value or range.
**  It points to the key elements (KANDs) making up that range, and
**  points to the next key (KOR).  OPF makes sure that each QEF_KOR
**  describes a disjoint key range.  If it can't (due perhaps to
**  parameterization), OPF will be conservative, to the point of generating
**  only one KOR with the widest possible bounds in some cases.
**
**  Each QEF_KAND node represents some key value or range bound for one
**  attribute.  There may be multiple KAND's for one lookup (KOR) in
**  a couple situations:
**  - multi-column keys, there will be (at least) one KAND per attribute;
**  - range keys, such as (i>=1 and i<=5), when there is one KAND for the
**    lower limit and another KAND (for the same attribute) for the upper
**    limit.
**
**  There are never multiple equality KAND's for the same attribute,
**  under the same KOR.  Such a thing would represent a key clause
**  like (k=2 and k=4) which is nonsense.  If the user query actually
**  does such a thing in a context where the optimizer can't just turn it
**  into FALSE (e.g. when the values are repeat query constants, or DBP
**  variables), we still only do one equality KOR, and let the orig
**  qualification CX figure the truth out by applying both tests.
**
**  You might imagine that the KAND would indicate the column and the
**  keying value, but it's not that simple.  The query might have multiple
**  range or half-range non-constant values:
**    k>=:a1 AND k<=:a2 AND k>=:a3 AND k<=:a4
**  which may be a result of:
**    (k BETWEEN :a1 AND :a2) OR (k BETWEEN :a3 AND :a4)
**  remember, if OPF can't guarantee disjoint ranges, it falls back on
**  conservative keying.  To this end, each KAND points to one or
**  more KATT entries which represent the actual keying values.  The
**  KAND has a type indicator that says how to winnow the KATT values:
**  find the smallest lower bound (>= operator), or the largest upper
**  bound (<= operator), or EQ for just-a-single-value.
**  FIXME it would actually make a lot more sense for OPF to simply
**  generate the disjuncts as if everything were constant and disjoint,
**  and let an improved version of qeq_ksort figure it all out at query
**  startup.
**
**  You might also imagine that the KAND would contain the DMR positioning
**  operator, but it doesn't;  those are in the KATT's as well.  This
**  oddity probably happened because the DMR_CB wants the positioning
**  operator in the DMR_ATTR_ENTRY's that describe a key to DMF, and
**  someone picked on the name similarity.  Whatever.
**
**  To take a couple of examples:
**  (assuming a 2-column btree key <i,str>)
**	select * from t
**	where ((i between 1 and 3 or i=6) and str<'lll')
**	   or (i between 15 and 20 and str='twenty')
**
**  produces:
**  KEY -> KOR -> KAND[i,MIN] -> KATT[i,GE,value 1]
**         |      KAND[i,MAX] -> KATT[i,LE,value 3]
**         |      KAND[str,MIN] -> KATT[str,GE, value '']
**         |      KAND[str,MAX] -> KATT[str,LE, value 'lll']
**         V
**         KOR -> KAND[i,EQ] -> KATT[i,EQ, value 6]
**         |      KAND[str,MIN] -> KATT[str,GE, value '']
**         |      KAND[str,MAX] -> KATT[str,LE, value 'lll']
**         V
**         KOR -> KAND[i,MIN] -> KATT[i,GE, value 15]
**                KAND[i,MAX] -> KATT[i,LE, value 20]
**                KAND[str,EQ] -> KATT[str,EQ, value 'twenty']
**
**  Note a few things here:  the OR inside the first boolean factor has
**  been broken out so that there are three keys;  and the str<'lll'
**  condition has been turned into the range (str>='' and str<='lll').
**  The key range is wider than the exact range, which is OK.
**  The orig qualification CX will apply the exact str<'lll' test.
**
**  Another example:
**	repeated select * from t
**	where i < :val1 and i < :val2;
**
**  produces:
**  KEY -> KOR -> KAND[i,MAX] -> KATT[i,LE, value val1]
**                               KATT[i,LE, value val2]
**
**  which is an example of when the runtime has to examine a list of KATT
**  values and choose one.  Unfortunately, this example falls afoul of
**  the conservatism rules mentioned above, and it ends up picking the
**  worst (largest) upper bound instead of the best.  Oh well!
**
**  And one more:
**	repeated select * from t
**	where (i between :a1 and :a2) or (i between :a3 and :a4)
**
**  produces:
**  KEY -> KOR -> KAND[i,MIN] -> KATT[i,GE, value a1]
**                |              KATT[i,GE, value a3]
**                V
**                KAND[i,MAX] -> KATT[i,LE, value a2]
**                               KATT[i,LE, value a4]
**
**  and this is why we have to choose the worst bounds instead of
**  the best.  (Consider a1=1, a2=3, a3=10, a4=12;  choosing the
**  tightest bounds clearly returns no rows!)
**
**  Keep in mind that the QEF_KEY / KOR / KAND / KATT stuff is part of
**  the QP, and as such are readonly at runtime.  Additional structure
**  is needed to properly sort and winnow the key values at runtime.
**  See the QEN_TKEY / NOR / NKEY stuff below.
**
**  TID's are not considered key columns, at least not normally.
**  Given both tid and key qualification, the QEF_KEY structure will only
**  have one or the other.  If there is nothing but tid qualification,
**  as in "select * from foo where tid=1024", the optimizer may generate
**  a QEF_KEY for the tid comparison, but if so then it's guaranteed that
**  the tid column will be the only attribute referenced anywhere in
**  that key structure.  (One reason for this is that tid lookup needs
**  a position-by-tid call to DMF, and NOT a position-by-key call.
**  DMF would refuse a position-by-key request that included a tid column.)

** Name: QEN_TKEY - top level runtime key list
**
** Description:
**
**	Since the QEF_KEY structure is part of the QP, it's not to be

**	the keys, especially if some key values are runtime query
**	parameters.
**
**	The solution is to maintain an almost-mirror of the QEF_KEY
**	structures that is attached to the DSH instead of the QP.
**	When a QP user needs to sort the KOR's or winnow the KATT's,
**	it does it against the mirror instead of the actual QEF_KEY
**	structure.
**
**  QEN_TKEY corresponds to QEF_KEY
**  QEN_NOR  corresponds to QEF_KOR
**  QEN_NKEY corresponds to QEF_KAND
**
**	There's no QEN structure corresponding to the QEF_KATT's,
**	it's OK for QEN_NKEY to point at the chosen QEF_KATT.
**
**	The runtime key stuff is only used for ORIG keys.  K-join
**	keys don't need it.
**  
**	All this runtime stuff (TKEY, NOR, NKEY) is allocated from the
**	same memory stream that the DSH came from, and is re-used when
**	a repeat query DSH is re-used.  It's not allowed to lose runtime
**	key elements that aren't executed, because they may be needed
**	next time.  To that end, qen_nkey is the key list for use by
**	the current execution, and qen_keys is the list of the original
**	set of QEN_NOR's allocated to the DSH.
**
**	([kschendel] If I were doing this, I might have simply mirrored the
**	QEF_KEY, rather than inventing a whole new set of structs;  but

    /* Note on QEN_PART_SEPARATE and QEN_PART_NESTED:
    ** For non-joining nodes (orig, sort, tsort), QEN_PART_SEPARATE says both
    ** "expect end-of-group from below" and "operate partition-wise and send
    ** end-of-group to caller".  These nodes never operate group-wise unless
    ** they're in the midst of a partition-compatible section of the QP.
    **
    ** For joining nodes (hash, FSM), the situation is a little more complex
    ** because we might want to either a) join partition-group by partition-
    ** group and return the complete answer to the caller, or b) join
    ** partition-group-wise and tell the caller end-of-group after each
    ** group is done.  (b) is needed for a nested PC-join, while (a) is
    ** needed for a higher-level join (eg under something that doesn't
    ** understand QE00A5's,  like most actions).
    ** Case (a) just sets QEN_PART_SEPARATE, while (b) also sets
    ** QEN_PART_NESTED.
    **
    ** It would be cleaner to use QEN_PART_NESTED for non-join nodes too,
    ** it just wasn't needed (and QEN_PART_NESTED came later...)
