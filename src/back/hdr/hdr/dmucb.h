/*
** Name: DMU_CHARACTERISTICS -- Table characteristics structure
**
** Description:
**	This structure is used to describe various table characteristics
**	to DMF:  structure, uniqueness, fillfactor, and so on.
**	The structure contains an "indicator" bitmap which shows
**	which characteristics are actually being passed, and a bunch
**	of values.
**
**	Indicator-only characteristics don't have an associated value;
**	all that's needed is the indicator.  A good example is DMU_TEMP_TABLE,
**	which says that the associated table is a temporary table.
**
**	Flag-valued characteristics are those which might be ON, OFF,
**	or not specified.  The associated flag is set (along with the
**	indicator, of course) if the passed value is ON.
**
**	Numeric-valued characteristics have some sort of associated
**	numeric value which is part of the structure.  Some numeric
**	characteristics take a set of predefined values (DMU_STRUCTURE),
**	and some take a more or less arbitrary value (FILLFACTOR or EXTEND).
**
**	The DMU_CHARACTERISTICS is not only used to pass values to DMF;
**	it's used by the parser to collect WITH-option values and
**	verify them.
**
**	As a historical note, DMU characteristics used to be passed
**	using a variable-length array.  Each array element had a type
**	and a value.  This form may have saved a bit of memory, but was
**	not especially convenient for parsing and checking.  Considerable
**	effort was being expended converting from one form to another.
**	The current DMU_CHARACTERISTICS structure isn't all that
**	large, and it's a lot easier to use by both parse and DMF.
**
** History:
**	12-Oct-2010 (kschendel)
**	    Ditch the dmu_char_array in favor of something that's
**	    easier for both the parser and DMF.

/*
** Name: DMU_PHYPART_CHAR -- Physical partition characteristics entry.
**
** Description:
**	DMU modify-like operations on multiple partitions need info
**	about the physical partitions involved.  The DMU_CB contains
**	a pointer (DM_DATA) to an array of DMU_PHYPART_CHAR, one entry
**	per physical partition.  Each entry holds:
**
**	oloc_count - The number of current (old) locations for the
**		partition.  This saves DMF a little bit of work since
**		it needs to know this to allocate memory.  (We could save
**		DMF even more work by passing the actual old locations,
**		but the format requirements are somewhat inconvenient.
**		So just the count is passed.)
**		* Note * This might be zero == unknown.
**	flags - Some flags.  Currently defined flags are:
**		DMU_PPCF_NEW_TABID - this entry describes a brand
**		new partition table, or at least one which is going to
**		be assigned a new table ID.  The caller (QEF) will pre-
**		create the new table and post-drop any unused ones.
**		DMU_PPCF_IGNORE_ME - this entry should be skipped.
**		Used when a partition-by-partition operation does not
**		apply to all physical partitions (eg modify pmaster
**		partition logpart to truncated).  Note that if the
**		operation is specific to ONE physical partition, QEF
**		will simply indicate that physical partition tabid in
**		the DMU_CB, instead of passing the master and a whole
**		slew of ignore-me's.
**	part_tabid - The table ID of the physical partition, passed in
**		case it's different from the old partition table or
**		perhaps an entirely new partition.
**	loc_array - The (new) location information for the physical
**		partition, if different from where the partition
**		currently resides.
**	char_array - The (new) characteristics for the physical partition.
**	key_array - The (new) key columns for the physical partition.
**
**	For this release (Feb '04), char_array and key_array are not used.
**
**	A ppchar array is not necessarily always present just because
**	the modify is dealing with a partitioned table.  Situations where
**	no ppchar array is present are:
**	- A non-repartitioning modify on one single physical partition.
**	  (The parse resolves this such that the modify dmu_tbl_id is
**	  adjusted to be that of the actual partition.)
**	- A non-repartitioning modify on the entire (master) table, with
**	  no location= specification.  Since no partitions can be changing
**	  locations, no ppchar array is needed.
**
**	In any situation where the modify preparation in QEU decides to
**	look at the partitions with DMT_SHOW, we'll build a ppchar array.
**	We can save DMF some work by feeding it current (old) location
**	counts.
**
**	Basically DMF needs to be prepared for a ppchar array on any
**	modify of a partitioned table, and should not attempt to draw any
**	fancy conclusions from the presence or absence of the array.
**
**	The parser only builds a ppchar array if it needs to do so because
**	of a table PARTITION logpart specification in the query.  (QEU
**	depends on this.)  QEU will build a ppchar array if the modify is
**	a repartitioning one, or if there is any question about changing
**	locations.
**
**	Some other observations:
**
**	The (new) location in any given ppchar entry is left empty
**	if the partition is already where it belongs;  UNLESS the
**	ppchar entry is describing a new partition.
**
**	New partitions are pre-created by QEU in the location where they
**	belong.  But DMF has no way to know where that is.  (New partitions
**	can't be looked up or queries until they become part of the
**	table, at the end of the modify.)  So we always pass the new
**	location info for newly created partitions.
**
**	Repartitioning modifys are indicated by the presence of a
**	non-null dmu_part_def, NOT by the presence or absence of a
**	ppchar array.  If the new scheme has more partitions than the
**	old, partition tables for the extra partitions will be pre-created
**	before DMF sees the modify.  If the new scheme has fewer partitions,
**	after DMF is done with the modify, QEF will drop the extra ones. 
**
**	For the special case of un-partitioning a table, there's no
**	ppchar_array;  DMF must re-use the old master table ID for the "new"
**	unpartitioned version, and if the location changes too then the
**	new location is in the dmu_cb dmu_location (just like it would be
**	for an ordinary nonpartitioned modify).
**
** History:
**	23-Feb-2004 (schka24)
**	    Need a way to feed partitioned/partitioning modify info
**	    about specific partitions.
**	11-Mar-2004 (schka24)
**	    Remove (unneeded) partno, change to old-location-count,
**	    update comments.
